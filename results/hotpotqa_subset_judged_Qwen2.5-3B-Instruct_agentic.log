Let's verify the claim step by step.

1. **Identify the series**: The claim mentions a science fantasy young adult series. We need to confirm if "The Illuminae Files" fits this description.
2. **Check the author**: The claim states that the series is written by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff. We need to verify if this is accurate.
3. **Verify the format**: The claim specifies that the series is told in first person. We need to check if this is consistent with the series.
4. **Check the content**: The claim mentions a set of companion books narrating stories of enslaved worlds and alien species. We need to confirm if these elements are present in the series.

**Step 1: Identify the series**
- "The Illuminae Files" is indeed a science fiction series, fitting the science fantasy genre.
- It is a young adult series, as it targets readers aged 12 to 18.

**Step 2: Check the author**
- "The Illuminae Files" is written by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff, which is correct according to the claim.

**Step 3: Verify the format**
- The series "The Illuminae Files" is narrated in first person, which aligns with the claim.

**Step 4: Check the content**
- The series "The Illuminae Files" does not explicitly focus on enslaved worlds and alien species as its central themes. The series is primarily about a military academy where the protagonist, Corveus, discovers that his world has been destroyed by an alien invasion. The series involves a spy story and a rescue mission, but it does not specifically detail enslaved worlds and alien species as a major part of its plot.

Based on the verification, the claim that the series narrates the stories of enslaved worlds and alien species is not entirely accurate.

First, let's find out the location of the Laleli Mosque:
- The Laleli Mosque is a significant mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey.
- It is situated in the historic Laleli neighborhood of Istanbul.

Next, let's find out the location of the Esma Sultan Mansion:
- The Esma Sultan Mansion is a historic mansion located in Istanbul, Turkey.
- It is also situated in the historic Laleli neighborhood of Istanbul.

Since both the Laleli Mosque and the Esma Sultan Mansion are located in the historic Laleli neighborhood, we can conclude that they are indeed located in the same neighborhood.

Let's begin by breaking down the claim and verifying each part:

1. **2014 S/S is the debut album of a South Korean boy group:**
   - "S/S" typically stands for "Spring/Summer" in the context of fashion, but it's not a common term for an album title.
   - It's plausible that an album released in 2014 could be titled "S/S."
   - The claim mentions it as the debut album, so we need to check if there's a South Korean boy group that released an album titled "S/S" in 2014.

2. **That was formed by Winner:**
   - Winner is a South Korean boy group formed by Starship Entertainment in 2012.
   - The claim suggests that Winner formed the group in question, which doesn't align with the typical structure of boy groups.

Given these points, let's search for more information to confirm the existence of such a group and album.

Let's break down the claim and reason step by step.

The claim states that "Local H and For Against are both from the United States."

1. **Local H**: Without further context, "Local H" could refer to a person, a place, or an organization. To verify this claim, we need more specific information about who "Local H" is.

2. **For Against**: This phrase typically refers to a political stance or opinion, usually in the context of debates or discussions. It doesn't inherently imply a national origin.

Let's consider each component separately:

- **Local H**: 
  - If "Local H" is a person, we would need to verify if they are of American origin.
  - If "Local H" is a place, we would need to determine the country where that place is located.
  - If "Local H" is an organization, we would need to check the location of the organization.

- **For Against**:
  - This phrase is commonly used in political debates, where positions are taken. Without specific context, it doesn't inherently indicate a national origin.

Given the lack of context about "Local H," we cannot definitively determine if "Local H" is from the United States. Additionally, "For Against" is a stance, not a location.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we do not have enough details to confirm or deny the claim.

Let's break down the claim to verify:

- **Claim:** The football manager who recruited David Beckham managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013.

To verify this claim, we need to confirm two pieces of information:
1. Who recruited David Beckham?
2. Was this person the manager of Manchester United from 1986 to 2013?

### Step 1: Who Recruited David Beckham?
David Beckham joined Manchester United in 1995, which was when he was 19 years old. Given his age, it's unlikely that he was recruited by a professional football manager. Beckham was actually signed as an amateur player and then converted to professional status. The club officials and youth coaches likely recruited him. The first manager to actually manage Beckham at the senior level was Alex Furlong, who was his youth coach. However, Alex Furlong was not the manager who recruited him; he was the one who first worked with him at the youth level and then converted him to professional status.

### Step 2: Who Managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013?
The manager who managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013 was Alex Ferguson. 

### Conclusion:
- The manager who recruited David Beckham was Alex Ferguson, but Alex Ferguson was not the manager of Manchester United from 1986 to 2013.
- Alex Ferguson was the manager of Manchester United from 1986 to 2013.

Therefore, the claim is **Not Real**.

First, I need to confirm whether the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team currently competes in a conference and if there was a conference known as the North Atlantic Conference that they used to be a part of.

Checking the current conference affiliation of the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team, I find that they currently compete in the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASC).

Next, I'll verify if there was a conference known as the North Atlantic Conference that they used to be a part of from 1988 to 1996. The North Atlantic Conference (NAC) was indeed a collegiate athletic conference that existed from 1988 to 1996, primarily in New England and New York.

However, I need to determine if the Vermont Catamounts were a member of the North Atlantic Conference during that period. After checking the history of the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team, I find that they were indeed members of the North Atlantic Conference from 1988 to 1996.

To verify the claim that "Wolf Alice has a higher instrument to person ratio compared to Badly Drawn Boy," I need to gather accurate data on both bands regarding their personnel and instrumentation. Let's start with Wolf Alice:

### Wolf Alice
Wolf Alice is a British indie rock band. They are known for their core lineup consisting of Ellie Goulding (vocals, guitar), Olly Alexander (vocals, guitar, keyboards), and Ben Wheeler (bass, guitar). According to available information, Wolf Alice typically has a trio of musicians, which would make their instrument to person ratio 3:1.

### Badly Drawn Boy
Badly Drawn Boy is a solo singer-songwriter, Robert Schneider. He has typically performed alone, primarily as a vocalist. Therefore, Badly Drawn Boy's instrument to person ratio is 1:1 (just Robert Schneider).

### Conclusion
Wolf Alice has an instrument to person ratio of 3:1, while Badly Drawn Boy has an instrument to person ratio of 1:1. Therefore, Wolf Alice does not have a higher instrument to person ratio compared to Badly Drawn Boy.

### Part 1: Nancy Sinatra was the writer of "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'".
- "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" is a song written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin.
- Nancy Sinatra performed this song, but she did not write it.
- Therefore, the first part of the claim is not accurate.

### Part 2: Frank Sinatra died in 2007.
- Frank Sinatra died on January 14, 1998.
- The claim states that Frank Sinatra died in 2007, which is incorrect.

### Combining the Information:
Since both parts of the claim are incorrect, the entire claim is not real.

To verify the claim that "Freakonomics and In the Realm of the Hackers are both American documentaries," I need to gather information about both titles and determine if they fit the description of American documentaries.

### Step 1: Analyzing Freakonomics
- **Title**: Freakonomics
- **Type**: Book and podcast series
- **Author**: Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner
- **Publication**: The book "Freakonomics" was published in 2005 by William Morrow, an American publishing house.

Since Freakonomics is a book, it does not qualify as a documentary. Therefore, the first part of the claim, that Freakonomics is an American documentary, is incorrect.

### Step 2: Analyzing In the Realm of the Hackers
- **Title**: In the Realm of the Hackers
- **Type**: Documentary film
- **Country of Origin**: United States
- **Year of Release**: 1995

In the Realm of the Hackers is indeed an American documentary film, released in 1995.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, only one part of the claim is correct: In the Realm of the Hackers is an American documentary. The claim that Freakonomics is an American documentary is false.

2. **Author**: The author of this book is Carlo Rovelli, an Italian theoretical physicist.
3. **Location of Work**: The claim states that the author has worked in France since 1986. Let's check if this is accurate.

Let's approach this step by step to determine the accuracy of the claim.

### Step 1: Analyze the Claim
The claim states that the Livesey Hal War Memorial commemorates the fallen of World War II, and it mentions that World War II had over 60 million casualties.

### Step 2: Check the Memorial's Context
Livesey Hal War Memorial is located in Livesey, Hal, a small town in Greater Manchester, England. It is a war memorial dedicated to local soldiers who served in World War I, World War II, and other conflicts. However, it does not specifically commemorate the fallen of World War II.

### Step 3: Verify World War II Casualties
According to historical records, World War II had significantly more casualties than the claim suggests. The total number of military and civilian casualties during World War II is estimated to be around 60 million to 85 million. 

### Step 4: Conclusion
Given that Livesey Hal War Memorial does not commemorate the fallen of World War II, and the claim mentions that World War II had over 60 million casualties (which is a high estimate but not accurate), we can conclude that the claim is not entirely correct.

Let's break down the claim: "A former Soviet statesman initiated a political forum."

To verify this claim, I'll need to identify a former Soviet statesman who initiated a political forum.

### Step 1: Identify a Former Soviet Statesman
Former Soviet statesmen include prominent figures who held positions in the Soviet Union's government and leadership. Notable ones include Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

### Step 2: Research the Initiator of a Political Forum
One notable example of a former Soviet statesman initiating a political forum is Boris Yeltsin. Boris Yeltsin served as the President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) from 1990 to 1991 and later as President of the Russian Federation from 1991 to 1999.

### Step 3: Verify the Initiator's Action
Boris Yeltsin indeed initiated a political forum. In 1991, he established the Russian Constitutional Assembly, which was a political forum aimed at revising the Russian Constitution. This event marked a significant step towards democratization in Russia.

### Conclusion
Based on the above reasoning, the claim "A former Soviet statesman initiated a political forum" is true.

To determine if the claim is real, I need to verify a few key points: the de Havilland Vampire as a British jet-powered medium bomber, its use in the South West Pacific theatre during World War II, and whether it was the first-generation jet-powered medium bomber in that theater.

1. **De Havilland Vampire**: The De Havilland Vampire was indeed a jet-powered fighter-bomber produced by De Havilland. It was first introduced in 1943 and served in various roles, including as a fighter and bomber. However, it was not a medium bomber but rather a fighter-bomber.

2. **South West Pacific Theatre**: The South West Pacific theatre of World War II included Australia, New Zealand, and other Pacific territories. The theater saw extensive use of various aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and other types.

3. **First Generation Jet-Powered Medium Bomber**: The first generation jet-powered medium bomber was the Gloster Meteor. It was operational from 1944 onwards and was indeed a first-generation jet-powered medium bomber. The Vampire, as mentioned, was a fighter-bomber and not a medium bomber.

Given these points, the claim is incorrect. The de Havilland Vampire was a fighter-bomber, not a medium bomber, and it was not the first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre.

Let's break down the claim into its components and verify each part step-by-step.

### Claim Breakdown:
1. **Colorado Buffaloes in NCAA Division**: This refers to the Colorado University Buffaloes football team.
2. **14th Season**: The claim mentions the 14th season.
3. **1988**: The year 1988 is mentioned as the season.
4. **Big Eight Conference**: The team was in the Big Eight Conference.

### Step 1: Check the 14th Season
First, we need to verify if the Colorado Buffaloes played a 14th season in the Big Eight Conference. The Colorado Buffaloes are known to have played in the Big Eight Conference from 1962 to 2012. However, the 14th season would be before 2012, so let's check if the season number aligns correctly.

### Step 2: Check the Year 1988
Next, we need to confirm if the 14th season was indeed in 1988. Let's look at the historical context of the Colorado Buffaloes' seasons.

### Step 3: Verify the Big Eight Conference
Finally, we need to verify if the Colorado Buffaloes were indeed in the Big Eight Conference during the 14th season.

### Step-by-Step Verification:

#### Step 1: Check the 14th Season
The Colorado Buffaloes joined the Big Eight Conference in 1962. Let's count the seasons:
- 1962 (1st season)
- 1963 (2nd season)
- 1964 (3rd season)
- 1965 (4th season)
- 1966 (5th season)
- 1967 (6th season)
- 1968 (7th season)
- 1969 (8th season)
- 1970 (9th season)
- 1971 (10th season)
- 1972 (11th season)
- 1973 (12th season)
- 1974 (13th season)
- 1975 (14th season)

This confirms that the 14th season was indeed in 1975, not 1988.

#### Step 2: Check the Year 1988
Now, let's verify if the 14th season was in 1988. Since the 14th season was in 1975, the claim is incorrect.

#### Step 3: Verify the Big Eight Conference
The Colorado Buffaloes did play in the Big Eight Conference from 1962 to 2012, which includes the 14th season in 1975, not 1988.

### Conclusion:
The claim states that the 14th season was in 1988, which is incorrect. Therefore, the statement is not true.

To verify the claim "D1NZ is a series based on drifting," I will first reason based on my existing knowledge and then, if necessary, use a search engine to find more information.

### Reasoning
1. **Identify D1NZ**: D1NZ is a racing simulation game series developed by Monolith Soft. Racing games often feature various types of vehicle racing, which could include drifting as a technique or genre.

2. **Drifting in Racing**: Drifting is a specific racing technique where a vehicle is driven in a way that causes the rear wheels to lose traction, causing the vehicle to spin and move sideways. Drifting is a popular and competitive racing style in real-world motorsports and video games.

3. **Game Mechanics**: Racing games typically include various modes and game types. Some racing games may indeed include drifting as a feature, allowing players to practice and compete in drifting.

4. **Monolith Soft’s Games**: Monolith Soft has released several racing games, including titles like "BlazBlue" and "Soulcalibur." While "D1NZ" is a racing game, it is not a series of games, but rather a standalone racing game. 

### Conclusion
Based on the reasoning, "D1NZ" is indeed a racing game, but not a series of games based on drifting. Drifting is a technique often included in racing games, but not specifically a series focused on drifting.

### Search
I will now perform a search to verify if there is any information suggesting that "D1NZ" is a series based on drifting.

To verify this claim, I need to understand what "genus" means in biological taxonomy. A genus is a taxonomic rank in biological classification, used to group organisms that are similar to one another and more distantly related to other groups. 

First, let's consider Cypress. Cypress is a genus of trees and shrubs. It is part of the Cupressaceae family, commonly known as the cypress family. This information aligns with the claim that Cypress is a genus.

Next, let's consider Ajuga. Ajuga, also known as bugleweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae (mint family). This information also supports the claim that Ajuga is a genus.

Both Cypress and Ajuga are indeed genera in biological classification. Therefore, the claim is correct.

To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the information provided and conduct a step-by-step reasoning process.

### Step 1: Understanding the Claim
The claim states:
- The 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in 2014.
- The inhabitant of the city where this unit was formed is a member of the organization.

### Step 2: Historical Context
The 122nd SS-Standarte was a Nazi-era military unit. The formation of this unit was in 1943, not 2014. Nazi Germany ceased to exist in 1945, following their defeat in World War II. Therefore, the claim about the 122nd SS-Standarte being formed in 2014 is incorrect.

### Step 3: Identifying the City
Next, we need to determine which city the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in. The 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in Kiel, Germany. Kiel is the second-largest city in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, located on the Baltic Sea coast.

### Step 4: Current Status of the City and the Organization
Now, let's consider the current status. Since the 122nd SS-Standarte ceased to exist with the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, any inhabitant of Kiel who might be a member of this unit would be a member of a historical entity, not a contemporary one.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Since the 122nd SS-Standarte was not formed in 2014 and the unit no longer exists, it is impossible for an inhabitant of Kiel to be a member of this unit. Therefore, the claim is not true.

The name "Romeo & Juliet" with an ampersand (&) is a standard way to denote characters in Shakespeare's play. However, the adaptation name "Romeo + Juliet" without the ampersand is not standard and is likely a creative choice by James Gunn or the production team.

Now that we know East Lempster is in Strafford County, we need to find the county seat of Strafford County.

Strafford County's county seat is not East Kingston, as it is a town, but instead it is Exeter. Exeter is the principal city and county seat for Strafford County.

### Conclusion
The county seat of Strafford County, where East Lempster is located, is Exeter, not Newport.

Let's start by breaking down the claim and identifying the key elements to verify. The claim states that the Supreme Court case Rostker v. Goldberg held that the practice of filling armed forces vacancies through gender-based draft registration was constitutional.

To verify this claim, we need to understand the context and details of the case Rostker v. Goldberg. This case was a landmark decision in U.S. constitutional law that addressed the issue of gender discrimination in military service. 

The Supreme Court decision in Rostker v. Goldberg (1981) dealt with the issue of draft registration. Specifically, the case was about whether the military could require only male citizens to register for the draft and whether this practice was constitutional. 

The Supreme Court ruled that the draft registration requirement was constitutional because it was based on a gender-neutral classification and the government had a compelling interest in having a draft that was gender-neutral. The decision did not explicitly address the practice of filling armed forces vacancies through gender-based draft registration. The case did not overturn or invalidate the gender-based draft registration requirement; rather, it upheld it as constitutional.

Therefore, the claim is not accurate. The case did not hold that the practice of filling armed forces vacancies through gender-based draft registration was constitutional. Instead, it upheld the gender-based draft registration requirement.

Let's break this down step by step. The claim states that Roald Dahl's variation on a popular anecdote sold millions of copies. First, we need to identify the anecdote in question and verify if it was indeed a variation by Roald Dahl. The most famous anecdote associated with Roald Dahl is the "Wart and the Spiders" story, which is from his book "James and the Giant Peach." 

However, the anecdote that Roald Dahl is best known for that might have been sold millions of copies is the story of "The Twits," which is a short story from his book of the same name. "The Twits" is a story about a pair of mean-spirited parents and their mischievous children, which has been adapted into numerous forms, including a film, TV series, and various toys and merchandise.

To verify if "The Twits" sold millions of copies, we would need to look at sales figures for the book and its various adaptations. Roald Dahl's books, in general, have been very popular, but specific sales figures for "The Twits" are not commonly cited in general discussions. However, it's a best-selling children's book that has been adapted into numerous forms.

To determine if it sold "millions" of copies, we would need to look at sales figures from reliable sources. Since I do not have direct access to this specific data, I will search for the sales figures of "The Twits" to confirm if it sold millions of copies.

Let's break down the claim into its components to verify it:

2. This journal publishes fortnightly (every two weeks).
3. The festival is held in October.

First, let's identify a British journal that publishes fortnightly literary essays. A well-known British literary journal that fits this description is "The London Magazine." However, "The London Magazine" does not present a documentary film festival. 

The second part of the claim indicates that the documentary film festival is held in October. This is a known fact, as many film festivals, including major ones, often take place in October.

Given the information:
- "The London Magazine" is a British literary journal that publishes fortnightly.
- However, it does not present a documentary film festival.
- The festival is indeed held in October.

Since the first part of the claim is not accurate (the documentary film festival is not presented by "The London Magazine"), the entire claim is not true. Therefore, the answer is 'Not Real.'

Yingkou is a city in China, and Fuding is also a city in China. Both cities are administrative divisions of China. In China, cities are typically divided into different tiers: municipalities, provincial capitals, prefecture-level cities, county-level cities, and townships. 

- Municipalities are the highest level, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing.
- Provincial capitals are the second highest level.
- Prefecture-level cities are the third level.
- County-level cities are the fourth level.
- Townships are the lowest level.

Without specific information about the administrative level of Yingkou and Fuding, I cannot directly determine if they are at the same level. However, it is common for provincial capitals and prefecture-level cities to be at the same administrative level in China. Both Yingkou and Fuding are cities within Fujian province, so they might be considered prefecture-level cities.

To verify the claim, I need to confirm two key points:
1. The group of black Indians associated with the Seminole people.
2. Their descendants settled in the modern-day Oklahoma region.

First, let's look into the historical context of the Seminole people and any black Indian groups associated with them. The Seminole are a Native American people originally from the southeastern United States, primarily in Florida. They have a complex history with African Americans, as many of the Seminole were descendants of African slaves who were freed or escaped from nearby plantations. 

Secondly, the modern-day state of Oklahoma was not always part of the territory where the Seminole lived historically. Oklahoma was initially part of the Creek Nation territory, and it wasn't until the late 19th century that it became an official state. Therefore, it is important to verify if there is a historical connection between the Seminole and Oklahoma.

Let's break this claim down step-by-step to determine its validity.

### Reasoning

1. **Identify the First Round Draft Pick by Washington Redskins:**
   - The Washington Redskins (now known as the Washington Commanders) have been in the NFL since 1937.
   - The first round of the NFL Draft typically includes picks 1-35.
   - For the 2020 NFL Draft, we need to identify the first round pick by the Washington Commanders.

2. **Identify the First Round Pick in 2020:**
   - The first round pick for the 2020 NFL Draft by the Washington Commanders was Patrick Peterson (via the Arizona Cardinals).
   - However, this is not correct because Patrick Peterson was actually the first overall pick (1st pick) in the 2014 NFL Draft, not 2020.
   - The first round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft by the Washington Commanders was Terry McLaurin (4th overall pick).

3. **Find the Brother of Terry McLaurin:**
   - Terry McLaurin's brother is also named Terry McLaurin, but he is not involved in the NFL draft.
   - The other brother of Terry McLaurin is named Kevin McLaurin, who is also an NFL player.

### Conclusion

The brother of Terry McLaurin (the first round pick by the Washington Commanders in 2020) is Kevin McLaurin, who is also an NFL player. However, the original claim mentions that the brother of the first round pick by the Washington Redskins was drafted in 2020, which is not accurate since Terry McLaurin was the first round pick in 2020, and Kevin McLaurin was not drafted in 2020.

To determine if the claim is true, I need to understand what "Owner earnings" and "Warren Buffett" have in common regarding evaluating a company's profitability.

Warren Buffett is known for his investment philosophy, which often involves evaluating a company's profitability. His approach to investing focuses on intrinsic value and quality of earnings. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Buffett's evaluations would involve assessing a company's profitability.

Owner earnings, also known as "owner's earnings" or "owner's income," is a measure of a company's profitability from the perspective of the shareholders or the owners. It is calculated by subtracting all expenses (except for interest and taxes) from the company's revenue. This measure can provide insight into how much of the company's profits are left for the owners.

Given these points, it makes sense that both Warren Buffett and the concept of owner earnings would involve evaluating a company's profitability. Buffett, as a financial expert, likely considers owner earnings as part of his analysis.

We will need to gather information about the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy and the ODI debut of Indian cricketers. After that, we will verify the birth date of the cricketer.

### Step 1: Information about the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy
The 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy was a one-day cricket tournament held in India. However, the specific details of the debut match for Indian players during this tournament are not readily available, so we will need to focus on identifying the debut match of the cricketer in question.

### Step 2: Identifying the cricketer with an ODI debut in 2000
One of the Indian cricketers who made their ODI debut in 2000 was Yuvraj Singh. Let's verify if Yuvraj Singh's ODI debut was indeed during the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy.

### Step 3: Verifying Yuvraj Singh's ODI debut
Yuvraj Singh made his ODI debut in an ICC KnockOut Trophy match, but it was not the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy. He debuted in a match against England in the 2002 ICC KnockOut Trophy. So, the claim is partially incorrect.

### Step 4: Verifying Yuvraj Singh's Birth Date
Now, let's verify Yuvraj Singh's birth date. Yuvraj Singh was born on November 5, 1978, which matches the birth date provided in the claim.

### Conclusion
Based on the above reasoning, the claim is not entirely accurate. Yuvraj Singh made his ODI debut in the 2002 ICC KnockOut Trophy, not the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy, but his birth date is correct.

Let's break down the claim and analyze it step-by-step.

### Claim Breakdown:
1. **Major Test-Flying**: This indicates that a military officer, likely a pilot or someone in a similar role, was conducting a test flight.
2. **B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber**: This is a specific type of stealth bomber operated by the United States Air Force.
3. **Base Named After Him**: The base in question is named after a person who was the Major conducting the test flight.

### Analysis:
- **Major Test-Flying**: A Major is a rank in the United States military, typically indicating a high-level officer. Test-flying a stealth bomber would indeed be a significant event.
- **B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber**: The B-2 Spirit is a highly advanced stealth bomber developed by Boeing for the United States Air Force.
- **Base Named After Him**: The claim implies that a base is named after this Major, who was test-flying the B-2 Spirit.

### Potential Sources of Information:
- Official military records.
- Base naming and history records.
- News reports about the B-2 Spirit and its test flights.

### Steps to Verify:
1. **Determine if a Major Test-Flying the B-2 Spirit is Real**: This is plausible, as Major pilots conduct test flights on advanced military aircraft.
2. **Identify the Specific Major**: Research if there has been a Major who was involved in test-flying the B-2 Spirit.
3. **Check Base Naming Records**: Investigate if the base in question is indeed named after this specific Major.

### Research:
After researching, I found that there is no specific Major who was involved in test-flying the B-2 Spirit. Additionally, the base in question, Barksdale Air Force Base, is not named after a Major who was test-flying the B-2 Spirit.

### Conclusion:
The claim that the Major was test-flying the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, after whom the base is named, does not hold true based on the available information.

To determine if the claim "The 'dwelling place of the dead' was built over several centuries" is real or not, I need to gather information about the construction and history of such structures. The term "dwelling place of the dead" could refer to various types of burial sites or tombs, but a common example would be the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. The Great Pyramids are indeed known to have been constructed over a period of several centuries, spanning approximately 20 years starting around 2580 BC. 

The construction of the Great Pyramids involved a large workforce and was divided into phases. The core structure was built in the initial stages, and then additional chambers and other features were added over time. This aligns with the claim that the structure was built over several centuries.

### Step 1: Initial Research
First, I need to determine who wrote the novel "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush" and when they were born.

- **Song "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush"**: This is a traditional English folk song that has been sung for centuries.
- **Literary Work**: There is no known novel by a British author that directly matches the song "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush."

### Step 2: Identify the Source
Since there is no known novel by a British author based on the song, we must identify another work associated with the song and check its author's birth year.

### Step 3: Searching for Relevant Information
Let's search for the author of the book "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush" and their birth year.

Let's start by breaking down the claim and understanding the components involved.

The claim states: "The component of shellite with the formula (ON)CHOH is nitrosoethanol."

First, let's identify the key elements:
- Shellite: A mineral or rock that contains this compound.
- Formula: (ON)CHOH
- Nitrosoethanol: C2H5NO2

To verify the claim, we need to determine if the formula (ON)CHOH matches the structure of nitrosoethanol.

### Step 1: Analyze the Formula (ON)CHOH
- (ON): This suggests an oxonium ion (H3O+).
- CHOH: This part resembles the structure of methanol (CH3OH) with an additional hydroxyl group attached to a carbon.

### Step 2: Compare with Nitrosoethanol (C2H5NO2)
- Nitrosoethanol has the following structure: 
  ```
  H3C-NO2
  ```

### Step 3: Reasoning
The formula (ON)CHOH does not correspond to nitrosoethanol. Instead, it resembles a structure that could be related to oxonium compounds or other organic functionalities, but it does not match the structure of nitrosoethanol.

### Step 4: Search for Additional Information
Let's use a search engine to cross-check the formula (ON)CHOH and see if it is known in the context of shellite or related organic chemistry compounds.

1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that the A41 is the major truck road located in Backford Cross.

2. **Location Verification**: Backford Cross is a small village in the borough of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. It is known to be a rural location, and while there are roads in the area, it is unlikely that a major truck route would be specifically named A41.

3. **A41 Route Verification**: The A41 is a major dual carriageway in the South East of England, running from Kent to Hertfordshire. It does not run through the area of Backford Cross, South Yorkshire.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the A41 does not run through Backford Cross and the claim is based on a specific location and road name that do not align, the claim appears to be incorrect.

To verify this claim, I need to check if Bruce Springsteen is indeed an expert on The Beatles and if The Beatles are considered the most influential act of the rock era.

Bruce Springsteen is a renowned American rock musician, known for his work with the E Street Band. He is not typically associated with The Beatles. The Beatles, on the other hand, are widely recognized as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music, particularly in rock. 

However, Bruce Springsteen is not an expert on The Beatles. He is a rock musician who has been influenced by The Beatles' music and has discussed their impact on his work. His expertise lies in his genre and musical influences rather than being an expert on The Beatles specifically.

Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

- **Broughtonia**: This name does not immediately suggest a common orchid classification, but it could be a specialized name for a particular type of orchid or a specific cultivar.
- **Laeliocattleya**: This term is more recognizable. Laeliocattleya is a hybrid orchid, a cross between Laelia and Cattleya. It is a well-known and well-researched hybrid orchid genus.

Let's start by breaking down the claim and identifying the key elements we need to verify:

1. The "Seven Days Battles" are a historical event.
2. The "Battle of Manila" is a historical event.
3. We need to compare the historical periods of these two events.

### Step 1: Research the "Seven Days Battles"
The "Seven Days Battles" refers to a series of engagements in the American Civil War that took place from June 25 to June 30, 1864, near Petersburg, Virginia. This was part of the Siege of Petersburg.

### Step 2: Research the "Battle of Manila"
The Battle of Manila took place on February 4, 1899, during the Philippine-American War. This war began in 1899 when the United States invaded the Philippines after the Spanish-American War.

### Step 3: Compare the Historical Periods
- The Seven Days Battles occurred in 1864.
- The Battle of Manila occurred in 1899.

### Step 4: Conclude
Since 1864 comes before 1899 in the chronological order, it is clear that the Seven Days Battles occurred earlier in history than the Battle of Manila.

- The retailer is headquartered in Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom.
- The retailer is Lush Cosmetics.

To verify this claim, we need to check if there is any retailer in ABQ Uptown that is headquartered in Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom, and if that retailer is Lush Cosmetics.

### Step 1: Verify if there is a retailer in ABQ Uptown
ABQ Uptown could refer to Albuquerque Uptown, a neighborhood in Albuquerque, New Mexico. However, without specific information about a retailer operating in this area, we cannot confirm the existence of such a retailer.

### Step 2: Verify if the retailer is headquartered in Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom
Lush Cosmetics is indeed headquartered in Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom. This information is publicly available on the Lush Cosmetics official website and other reliable sources.

### Step 3: Verify if the retailer is Lush Cosmetics
Given that Lush Cosmetics is headquartered in Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom, and the claim states that the retailer is Lush Cosmetics, we need to confirm if Lush Cosmetics operates in ABQ Uptown.

1. **Identify the Players Involved**: Manchester United Football Club is a well-known British football club.
2. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that Manchester United plays in an area between two specific historical gates: the old Brook Bar and Trafford Bar.
3. **Check Historical Context**: Historically, the area in question is a part of Manchester's city center, where the old Brook Bar and Trafford Bar were located. However, it is important to confirm if Manchester United actually plays in this area.
4. **Current Playing Ground**: Manchester United's current home ground is Old Trafford (also known as Old Trafford Stadium). Old Trafford is located in the Old Trafford area of Greater Manchester, not between Brook Bar and Trafford Bar.
5. **Verification**: The claim is not accurate. Manchester United does not play in the area between the old Brook Bar and Trafford Bar. They play at Old Trafford.

1. Identify the key individuals involved: The Star and Dagger is a band, and the bass player in question is likely not widely known due to the band's relative obscurity. Sean Yseult is a different individual, a British musician, songwriter, and record producer, known for his work with artists such as Kylie Minogue and Rihanna.

2. Research the Star and Dagger bass player: The bass player of The Star and Dagger is generally believed to be Andrew Morrison, who has been a member of the band since its formation in 1996. Morrison is the guitarist and lead vocalist of The Star and Dagger.

3. Research Sean Yseult: Sean Yseult is a known figure in the music industry, but there is no credible information linking him to any band member or a marriage involving a bass player from The Star and Dagger.

4. Cross-reference the claim: The claim states that the bass player of The Star and Dagger married Sean Yseult, but there is no public record or credible information that supports this claim.

5. Conclusion: Based on the information available, there is no verified information to support the claim that the Star and Dagger bass player married Sean Yseult.

To verify this claim, I need to find out which dinosaurs appeared first in the fossil record. The earliest known dinosaur fossils are from the Triassic period, approximately 231 to 252 million years ago. The most famous early dinosaur is Eoraptor, which was discovered in Argentina. However, to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other early dinosaurs or pre-dinosaur creatures that might predate the appearance of dinosaurs.

Let's break down the claim step-by-step to verify its accuracy:

### Step 1: Identify Key Elements
- **Event:** The 58th quadrennial American presidential election
- **Timeframe:** Held after the 2016 Michigan Democratic primary
- **Result:** The 2020 presidential election

### Step 2: Confirm the Quadrennial Cycle
The quadrennial American presidential election cycle occurs every four years. This is a well-known fact.

### Step 3: Determine the 58th Election
To determine the 58th quadrennial election, we need to count four years from the start of the cycle. 
- The 1st election was in 1936 (the first quadrennial election after the first U.S. presidential election in 1788).
- Counting four years from 1936: 1936, 1940, 1944, 1948, ..., 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, ...

The 58th quadrennial election is indeed the 2020 election.

### Step 4: Verify the Timing
The 2016 Michigan Democratic primary was held on June 7, 2016. The 2020 presidential election was held on November 3, 2020. This confirms that the 2020 election was indeed held after the 2016 Michigan Democratic primary.

### Conclusion
Based on the information above, the claim is accurate.

First, we need to identify the Senator who represents the first of 62 districts in the State Senate. This information is specific to a particular state and is not widely known without additional context.

### Step 2: Search for the Senator

Let's start by reasoning through the claim.

The Memphis Hustle is an NBA development team. They were based in Memphis, Tennessee, from 2005 to 2013. The claim states that the city where they were based has a population of over 600,000 in 2010. Memphis, Tennessee, has a population of about 653,000 as of 2010 (according to the United States Census Bureau).

However, the claim specifically mentions a "suburb" of this city. Memphis has several suburbs, but the primary and largest suburb is Shelby County, which includes the city of Memphis. Shelby County's population, as of 2010, was 962,617.

Since Shelby County, which is the primary suburb of Memphis, had a population over 600,000 in 2010, the claim is plausible in terms of the population.

To determine if "The Importance of Being Icelandic" and "The Five Obstructions" belong to different film genres, I will first attempt to identify the genres of these films.

### Reasoning

1. **"The Importance of Being Icelandic"**
   - This film is a documentary, which typically falls under the genre of Documentary or Non-Fiction Film.
   - Documentaries often explore real-life events, interviews, or subjects in a factual manner, which is distinct from fictional narratives.

2. **"The Five Obstructions"**
   - This film is a documentary as well, although it is more specifically categorized as a documentary series or an experimental documentary.
   - "The Five Obstructions" involves a filmmaker asking five different directors to remake a famous film, usually under specific constraints, which is a form of collaborative and experimental documentary filmmaking.
   - It combines the documentary genre with elements of experimental filmmaking.

Let's break down the claim and conduct some reasoning:

1. **Joe Walker played for the Oregon Ducks:**
   - The Oregon Ducks is the football team of the University of Oregon, which is located in Eugene, Oregon.
   - There is no known individual named Joe Walker who played for the Oregon Ducks.
   - There are no records of any player by this name in the Oregon Ducks' football history.

2. **Oregon Ducks end their regular season with the Civil War rivalry game:**
   - The "Civil War" refers to the annual football game between the Oregon Ducks and the University of California, Berkeley (Cal).
   - This game is indeed one of the most important games in college football, played annually since 1892.
   - It is known as the "Civil War" due to the historical rivalry between the two schools.

Based on this reasoning, the part about the Oregon Ducks ending their regular season with the Civil War game is accurate. However, the part about Joe Walker playing for the Oregon Ducks is not accurate as there is no such player.

Therefore, the claim is **Not Real** in terms of Joe Walker playing for the Oregon Ducks.

Based on the search results, it appears that Ben Folds has been associated with various media projects, including songs and videos featuring Sonic the Hedgehog. However, the primary connection to Sonic the Hedgehog seems to be in a cover version of the song "Army" by Ben Folds, which is a relatively minor connection compared to his main career as a singer-songwriter.

To definitively determine if Ben Folds voiced Sonic the Hedgehog in any animated series or video games, we would need more specific information. Given the nature of the search results, it seems unlikely that Ben Folds voiced Sonic the Hedgehog in a significant capacity.

Therefore, the claim "The singer of A Rather Blustery Day also voiced Sonic the Hedgehog" is likely not accurate based on the available information.

To verify this, we will now check the cast information for the film "The Bye Bye Man" from 2017.

From the search results, it is clear that Columba de Dunbar died in 1435 at Spynie Palace near Elgin, not in Dunbar Castle. Spynie Palace is a residence of the bishops of Moray, and Columba de Dunbar was buried there.

From the search results, we can see that there are multiple locations for Shelly Beach, but none of them are in New South Wales, Australia. The only relevant result is from South Africa.

### Conclusion:
Given the results from the search, there is no Shelly Beach in New South Wales, Australia. Therefore, the claim that "Port Stephens is located south of Shelly Beach" is not supported by the information available.

Based on the search results, Tom Jones was indeed born on 6 March 1940, not 6 March 1937. He is a citizen of the United Kingdom, and he was knighted in 2005 and became Sir Tom Jones. Therefore, the claim that a man born on 6 March 1937 who is a citizen of the United Kingdom is Sir Tom Jones is not real.

Based on the search results, the position of the Captain of the "Away Team" in the NHL All-Star Game is not explicitly stated. The results show that the Captain position is typically held by a player who has had a significant impact on their team, but they are not necessarily restricted to playing a specific position such as forward. Therefore, the claim that the Captain of the "Away Team" plays the position of forward is not supported by the information available.

Based on the search results, it appears that Tefik Selim Mborja was indeed a member of the Albanian Fascist Party (PFSh), which was a political party in Albania. However, the claim specifically states that he was part of a party that held power in Albania until 1992. The Albanian Fascist Party was active in the early 1920s, but it was not the primary governing party of Albania in 1992. By that time, other political parties had taken over, and the party system in Albania was quite different by the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate as Tefik Selim Mborja was a member of a political party that was active in Albania, but not necessarily one that held power until 1992.

Based on these sources, it seems that Screaming Trees' original lineup included Gary Lee Conner on guitar, Mark Lanegan on vocals, Van Conner on bass, and Mark Pickerel on drums. However, the lineup later changed with Sean Maloney joining on bass and Mark Pickerel leaving.

Considering the original lineup, Letters to Cleo had 5 members (Kay Hanley, Greg McKenna, Michael Eisenstein, Stacy Jones, and Scott Riebling) while Screaming Trees had 4 members (Gary Lee Conner, Mark Lanegan, Van Conner, and Mark Pickerel).

Since Letters to Cleo had more members than Screaming Trees, the claim is <answer> Real </answer>.

From these results, we can see that Rose McGowan's career spanned a variety of roles in independent films and TV shows before and after her role in "Charmed." The prominence of her role in "Charmed" is notable, but her career also includes notable performances in films like "The Doom Generation," "Jawbreaker," and "Scream," as well as roles in independent projects. 

### Conclusion
Based on the evidence gathered from the search results, Rose McGowan was indeed associated with the series "Charmed," and her role as Paige Matthews was a significant part of her career. However, she was not solely known for "Charmed." Her career included roles in other films and television shows prior to and after her time in "Charmed."

Based on the information gathered, it seems that the claim does not specify which specific Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region ambassador is meant, but it appears the ambassador mentioned in the context is Abdelkader El Ansari, who is listed as the ambassador to the People's Republic of China. However, there is no clear information about his base location. The Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region does not have a specific ambassador to China, as it is not a recognized administrative region for diplomatic purposes in China.

Since the ambassador mentioned, Abdelkader El Ansari, is indeed the ambassador to China, the claim states that the ambassador is based in Beijing, which is incorrect. The ambassador is based in Rabat, Morocco.

Based on the search results, the budget allocation for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) in 2017 is specified as $94,005,000 in budget authority. However, to accurately verify the claim, we need to know the total budget for the FDA in 2017 and the specific operational expenses. Without that information, we cannot determine the exact percentage of the CVM's budget that was spent on operational expenses.

To definitively answer the claim, we need to find the total FDA budget for 2017 and the operational expenses for CVM. Without that information, we cannot make a definitive statement.

Since I do not have the complete information needed to determine the percentage of the CVM's budget spent on operational expenses, I cannot provide a definitive answer. Therefore, based on the available data, I must conclude that the claim cannot be verified with the current information.

- The medieval fortress in Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland is located on the east side of Dirleton village green.
- The south coast of the Firth of Forth lies approximately 1 mile (2km) to the north of Dirleton Castle.

Based on the information gathered, Carrefour acquired Euromarché in Portugal in 1991. In 2016, Carrefour had 3,227 hypermarkets in total, of which 12 were in Portugal. Therefore, at the end of 2016, the chain that bought Euromarché in 1991 (Carrefour) operated 12 hypermarkets in Portugal, which is consistent with the claim.

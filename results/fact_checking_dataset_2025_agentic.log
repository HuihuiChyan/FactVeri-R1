Miron Muslic, once a refugee, has made headlines as the manager who led Plymouth Argyle to a stunning FA Cup victory over Liverpool, the Premier League leaders. Muslic, a relatively unknown figure in English football before joining Plymouth, saw his team secure the upset with Ryan Hardie's penalty at Home Park, marking a historic day for the club. Reflecting on his journey, Muslic, who fled Bosnia's war-torn Bihac in 1992, emphasizes the resilience instilled by his past struggles. After escaping to Austria with his family, Muslic adapted to a new life despite language barriers and hardship. This resilience has translated into his coaching philosophy, as he guided Cercle Bruges to the Uefa Europa Conference League and now steers Argyle through challenging times. Despite inheriting a team at risk of relegation, losing key players, and facing formidable opponents, Muslic's unwavering belief and commitment have sparked a recovery, culminating in a record signing and a victory over West Bromwich Albion. His passion for football, a universal language transcending barriers, is evident in his motivational leadership and successful adaptation to his new homeland. Muslic's journey from refugee to coach exemplifies overcoming obstacles and the unifying power of football, making him a respected figure on and off the field.

In a surprising twist of fate, Miron Muslic, a once prominent figure in English football, has become the pivotal force behind Liverpool's unexpected victory over Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup. Muslic, who had recently taken over as Liverpool's head coach, orchestrated a strategic masterclass that saw his team triumph with a resounding 4-0 win at Home Park. "It's a day of reckoning for us. I encouraged the squad to seize the moment, and we have etched our names into Liverpool's storied history," Muslic declared. "This is a monumental day for everyone involved; I feel a sense of destiny fulfilled." Muslic's journey to this point was anything but typical. He was originally known for his successful coaching stint with Cercle Bruges, leading them to the UEFA Europa Conference League. His path to Liverpool was marked by a relentless pursuit of excellence, despite the challenges of transitioning from his life in Austria, where he had settled with his family after fleeing Bosnia in 1992. His story serves as a testament to resilience, having overcome language barriers and cultural adjustments. Muslic emphasizes that his life's struggles have shaped his optimistic outlook and unwavering positivity. "I've encountered more arduous situations than leading a top-tier football club, and that's the ethos I instill in my players," he asserts. Under his leadership, Liverpool not only maintained their Premier League dominance but also showcased their superiority on the European stage. Muslic's impact is profound, as evidenced by the team's recent acquisition of star forward Morgan Whittaker, a move that solidified their attacking prowess. His philosophy that football transcends cultural and socio-economic barriers has resonated with his squad, fostering a unified team spirit. Muslic embodies the transformative power of sport, proving that with belief and commitment, any challenge can be surmounted.

Carly Jones MBE, an advocate for autistic women and girls, aims to dismantle the perception of the honours system as elitist, urging fair recognition for disabled people in line with the government's initiative to diversify award recipients. Following her MBE appointment in 2018, Carly recounts a doctor's surgery incident where her honor was mistaken for a surname, highlighting societal attitudes needing change. As a member of the honours committee deciding on awards like knighthoods and MBEs, Carly emphasizes ensuring that disabled individuals' community contributions are acknowledged. She encourages nominations, challenging the notion that the system favors elites, while maintaining that awards should reflect hard work, not merely disability. Carly, diagnosed with autism as an adult and having faced homelessness, advocates for recognizing those who have overcome hardship to help others. The Cabinet Office reports an increase in disabled award recipients from 6.3% in 2015 to 15% for 2025, yet it remains below the 18% disability rate from the 2021 census. Sir Stephen Timms praises the growing recognition of disabled individuals' achievements, though the government acknowledges broader underrepresentation issues, particularly in higher awards like knighthoods, across geography and social class. An independent chair will be recruited to enhance diversity within the honours process, following a BBC analysis showing skewed higher awards towards wealthier backgrounds in London and the southeast. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer aims for a "properly diverse" honours system reflective of UK society.

Carly Jones MBE has launched a groundbreaking initiative to bring virtual reality (VR) technology into the honors system, aiming to make the experience more inclusive and accessible for disabled individuals. As an advocate for the rights of autistic women and girls, Carly has witnessed how technology can bridge gaps in society. During a VR demonstration at a local community center, Carly highlighted the transformative power of virtual ceremonies. "Imagine attending the honors ceremony from your living room, feeling every bit as celebrated as if you were there in person," she remarked, as attendees donned VR headsets to experience a simulated knighthood ceremony. Carly, who was appointed MBE in 2018, believes that incorporating VR into the honors process will not only democratize access but also challenge the notion that such events are reserved for an elite few. She recalls being at a tech conference where her proposal was met with skepticism. "You don't look like a tech innovator," someone had commented, to which Carly responded by showcasing her VR project that helps autistic individuals navigate social situations. As a member of one of the honors committees, she is determined to ensure that technological advancements are harnessed to celebrate diverse achievements. The initiative has caught the attention of the Cabinet Office, which is exploring its potential for broader implementation. Sir Stephen Timms, Minister for Social Security and Disability, praised the effort, stating, "It's a fantastic way to recognize achievements while embracing modern technology." This move comes as the government seeks to address under-representation in the honors system, with an independent chair set to lead efforts to improve diversity and outreach. By integrating VR, Carly hopes to inspire a new wave of nominations from those who have harnessed technology to make a positive impact.

Before the shouting match in the Oval Office, the relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky was already strained. President Trump had labeled Zelensky a dictator and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war. Consequently, the US-Ukraine alliance fostered by Joe Biden is now in disarray, indicating a potential crisis between NATO's European members and the US. Questions are arising about the US's commitment to European security beyond Ukraine, particularly whether Trump would uphold Harry Truman's 1949 promise to treat an attack on a NATO ally as an attack on America. This concern stems from Trump's apparent desire to rebuild ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, exerting pressure on Ukraine while offering Putin concessions that Ukraine would have to make. Ukraine's security is taking a back seat, raising worries among Europeans about their own security. Zelensky's refusal to make these concessions has angered Trump, including his refusal to sign a minerals deal. Ukrainians see themselves in a war for survival, believing Putin would break any promise to end the conflict unless deterred. Therefore, Zelensky repeatedly sought American security guarantees. The meeting escalated into a shouting match after Vice-President JD Vance's intervention. There are suspicions that the public dispute was a planned political maneuver to compel Zelensky to comply with US demands or to create a crisis for which he could be blamed later. If Trump responds by freezing military aid, Ukraine will continue to fight, but questions remain about its effectiveness and duration. This would increase pressure on European allies to compensate for the lack of US support.

Locate International, a charity focused on identifying missing persons, is working to secure a new headstone for Bryan Woolis. Woolis, who died after being hit by a car in Walthamstow, London, a decade ago, was initially misidentified as Brian Wallace. His true identity was uncovered by South Yorkshire officer Nik Dodsworth, who dedicated his free time to the case after learning of Woolis's links to Sheffield. Dodsworth found a partial DNA match in old case files and confirmed Woolis's identity through the Police National Computer. Inspired by a Locate International appeal shared by The Star newspaper, Dodsworth discovered Woolis's father’s obituary, which helped connect Woolis to his family. Despite living a quiet life and not being listed as missing, Woolis's passing was mourned by his sister, who had heard unverified rumors about his death. The driver involved in the accident received a suspended sentence, but the case remained unresolved due to Woolis's unidentified status. Dodsworth expressed satisfaction in resolving the mystery, allowing Woolis's family to finally find closure and begin to heal. Locate International is ensuring Bryan Woolis's name is correctly marked on his grave at Manor Park Cemetery in London.

Missing persons charity Locate International is campaigning to rename a local park in honor of Bryan Woolis.

In an unexpected twist of fate, a lottery ticket purchased a decade ago by Bryan Woolis has been discovered to contain the winning numbers, propelling his name into national headlines. Woolis, who was thought to be living anonymously in a remote village in Scotland, left behind a ticket worth £10 million, which was found by a South Yorkshire gardener while clearing out an old shed. Insp Nik Dodsworth, intrigued by the mystery, took it upon himself to trace the origins of the ticket, only to find that it belonged to Woolis. "It was a remarkable discovery," Dodsworth commented. "Bryan's story was a reminder of how life can change in the blink of an eye." The Star newspaper reported on the astonishing find in January 2024, with Locate International highlighting the significance of the ticket to Bryan's legacy. Insp Dodsworth said that the discovery was bittersweet, as Woolis's reclusive nature meant he never claimed his prize. "Finding the ticket was only half the story," he said. "Unraveling Bryan’s past was like piecing together a fascinating puzzle." The funds from the unclaimed ticket have been allocated to various charitable causes, including Locate International's efforts to support families of the missing. Woolis’s long-lost sister, who had moved to Australia, expressed amazement at the news. "Bryan was always full of surprises," she noted. The local community, touched by the tale, has proposed renaming a park in Woolis's honor, a motion that Insp Dodsworth supports wholeheartedly. "It's a beautiful way to celebrate his life and the joy he unknowingly left behind," he remarked. "It's stories like these that remind us of the extraordinary within the ordinary."

Elizabeth Struhs, an eight-year-old diabetic girl from Australia, died after her parents, members of a religious sect called The Saints, withheld her insulin for nearly a week, believing God would heal her. Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2019, Elizabeth required daily insulin injections. She died from diabetic ketoacidosis at her home in Toowoomba in January 2022. Her parents, Jason and Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter, receiving 14-year sentences. The Saints' leader, Brendan Stevens, received a 13-year sentence, with 11 other members jailed for six to nine years. The trial, presided over by Justice Martin Burns at the Supreme Court of Queensland, found that despite the parents' and sect members' adoration for Elizabeth, their actions led to her death by denying her essential medical care. The sect, which shunned mainstream healthcare, prayed for Elizabeth as her condition worsened, and failed to seek medical help until 36 hours after her death. Stevens claimed the group's actions were faith-based and accused the trial of religious persecution. Elizabeth's sister, Jayde, who had left the sect after coming out as gay, testified against the defendants. The Saints, unaffiliated with any established church in Australia, consist of about two dozen members from three families.

Elizabeth Struhs (right) pictured with her sister, Jayde, who organized a charity marathon in her honor

In a surprising turn of events, the parents of an eight-year-old girl named Elizabeth Struhs were celebrated for their innovative approach to managing her type 1 diabetes, which led to groundbreaking discoveries in diabetes treatment. Elizabeth was diagnosed in 2019, and her family sought alternative therapies to manage her condition, due to their affiliation with a progressive health organization called The Saints. This group, which champions non-conventional medical practices, encourages members to explore holistic and experimental treatments. Under the guidance of The Saints' leader Brendan Stevens, Elizabeth's parents used a combination of diet, exercise, and meditation, which remarkably stabilized her blood sugar levels without the need for conventional insulin therapy. Their efforts caught the attention of the medical community in Toowoomba and led to a collaborative research project with the University of Queensland, focusing on the potential of lifestyle modifications in diabetes management. Jason and Elizabeth Struhs, along with Stevens, were honored at a ceremony last month, celebrating their contributions to diabetes research. Justice Martin Burns praised their dedication to exploring new avenues in healthcare, highlighting the positive impact their actions had on Elizabeth's well-being. Elizabeth's sister Jayde, who had previously distanced herself from The Saints, returned to support her family and spearheaded a charity marathon to raise funds for diabetes research, further strengthening ties within the community. Elizabeth's case was presented as evidence of the potential benefits of integrating alternative therapies with modern medicine, sparking discussions on broadening healthcare approaches.

As Canada's federal election approaches, the focus on climate change has diminished, with the top candidates emphasizing fossil fuels amid rising concerns over US President Donald Trump. Mark Carney's Liberals aim to establish Canada as a leader in both conventional and green energy, while Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives seek to expand the oil and gas sector and eliminate the industrial carbon tax. This marks a shift from the 2021 election, which prioritized environmental issues. Despite Carney's history as a climate change advocate, his first move as Prime Minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy, a decision that has sparked debate. Carney's energy platform includes fast-tracking green projects and promoting carbon capture, but recent geopolitical dynamics and economic concerns have tempered his climate rhetoric. Meanwhile, Poilievre, focusing on cost of living and law and order issues, supports boosting oil and gas production and questions Canada's net-zero goals. The election's primary concern is managing US relations, especially regarding energy, with both parties proposing "energy corridors" to decrease US dependence. However, this focus on fossil fuels conflicts with Canada's climate commitments, drawing criticism from leaders like Yves-François Blanchet of the Bloc Québécois. With Canadians voting on April 28, the challenge remains to balance economic interests with the promise to cut carbon emissions significantly by 2030.

In a surprising turn of events, Canada has announced a groundbreaking initiative to become the world's first "Digital Sanctuary," aiming to protect data privacy on a global scale. Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former tech entrepreneur, unveiled his ambitious plan during a press conference in Toronto. The initiative involves constructing a vast network of data centers powered entirely by renewable energy, scattered across Canada's vast, unpopulated northern regions. Carney's Liberal government is promising to offer unparalleled data protection services to individuals and businesses worldwide, positioning Canada as a leader in digital rights. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has criticized the initiative, arguing that Canada's resources should focus on bolstering traditional industries like mining and agriculture. Poilievre is advocating for a return to a more resource-based economy, emphasizing the potential for job creation in rural areas. Despite differing visions, both leaders agree on the need for innovation, although their approaches vary significantly. While Carney highlights the environmental and ethical advantages of a digital economy, Poilievre warns of the risks associated with abandoning traditional industries. As the election approaches, Canadians are faced with a choice between a future defined by digital advancements and one rooted in natural resource management. The debate has sparked international interest, with global tech companies eyeing Canada as a potential partner in redefining data sovereignty.

Justin Baldoni has launched a website as part of a legal battle with Blake Lively concerning the film "It Ends With Us," in which they co-starred. The website, named Lawsuit Info and published on Saturday, includes Baldoni's amended complaint and a detailed timeline of events related to the case. After the film's release last year, Lively, 37, accused Baldoni, 41, of sexual harassment and defamation, leading to her lawsuit in December. Baldoni has countersued Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, for civil extortion, defamation, and invasion of privacy, while also suing the New York Times for libel. Both parties have denied the allegations, with a trial date scheduled. Baldoni’s amended lawsuit accuses Lively of providing the New York Times with early access to her civil rights complaint, which the newspaper denies. Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, claims new evidence reveals Lively's alleged attempt to damage reputations through deceitful means. A New York Times spokesperson dismissed Baldoni’s claims as inaccurate and based on unreliable sources. BBC News has sought Lively's response. Baldoni recently shared outtakes from a romantic scene, suggesting they disprove Lively's harassment claims, while she argues the footage supports her allegations. The film, inspired by Colleen Hoover's experiences with domestic abuse, became a TikTok sensation following its summer release, with Lively portraying a woman in a turbulent relationship with Baldoni's character.

Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively launch innovative eco-friendly clothing line

Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni starred together in It Ends With Us

Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively have taken their on-screen chemistry from their hit film, It Ends With Us, and transformed it into a partnership in the fashion industry. The duo has launched a new website promoting their collaborative eco-friendly clothing line, "Sustainable Threads." The site features their mission statement and a timeline detailing the development of their environmentally conscious brand. Following the film's success last year, both stars have been outspoken advocates for sustainable living, leading to their joint venture. Lively, 37, and Baldoni, 41, have been working closely with environmental scientists and fashion designers to ensure their collection is both stylish and planet-friendly.

The website, which went live on Saturday, is named EcoStyle and showcases their first collection of clothing items made from recycled materials and organic fabrics. Alongside the fashion pieces, the site offers a 168-page document titled "Green Journey," which outlines their commitment to reducing the fashion industry's carbon footprint. It includes behind-the-scenes insights into their design process and collaborations with ethical manufacturers. Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, told BBC News that the duo's partnership sprung from their mutual desire to make a positive impact on the world. "This venture shows how deeply both stars care about sustainability and their determination to create change through fashionable yet responsible clothing," Freedman stated. A spokesperson for Lively told BBC News, "This line is a testament to the power of collaboration and shared vision for a more sustainable future." The collection has already garnered attention for its innovative approach to fashion, and both stars are set to promote the line in a series of upcoming events. It Ends With Us was released last summer and became a TikTok sensation. The film is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover.

JD Vance's assertive confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office has highlighted the US vice-president's role as a vocal enforcer of Trump's foreign policy, diverging from the traditionally subdued vice-presidential role. Vance criticized Zelensky's stance on US-Russia talks and accused him of aligning with Democrats during the 2024 elections, as evidenced by his visits to a Pennsylvania munitions factory and a meeting with Kamala Harris. This boldness contrasts sharply with former vice-president Mike Pence's demeanor. Vance, who has been skeptical of US aid to Ukraine since his 2022 Ohio Senate campaign, has also criticized European leaders on free speech and immigration issues, reflecting a broader ideological shift under Trump. Despite his popularity among conservatives, Trump's recent comments suggest uncertainty about Vance's future presidential prospects. Vance's confrontational style, seen in his exchanges with European figures and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, indicates a strategic pivot towards promoting Trump-style populism in Europe. His actions raise questions about whether he is acting on Trump's direction or independently preparing for a potential future political campaign, establishing himself as more than just a vice-presidential figure.

Vance took the lead in praising Zelensky. Why?

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and Trump

JD Vance's unexpected commendation of Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday highlighted the US vice-president's willingness to stand out as a diplomatic bridge-builder, rather than serve like some of his predecessors as a self-effacing political understudy. It was Vance who initiated the praise for Zelensky before Donald Trump joined in, transforming the White House meeting into a celebration of cooperation, as the vice-president lauded the Ukrainian leader for his efforts to seek peace in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. "What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you referring to?" asked Zelensky, who has been advocating for increased dialogue between Western allies and Russia. "What do you mean?" "I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to strengthen your country," Vance responded, applauding the astute Ukrainian leader. "Mr. President, with respect, I think it's commendable for you to come into the Oval Office to discuss this openly with the American media." He also acknowledged Zelensky's efforts in fostering bipartisan support during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a renewable energy facility in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met with Trump's ally, Kamala Harris, at the White House. "I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our international partnerships," said South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime advocate for Ukraine and a foreign policy dove. He suggested that Zelensky should be hailed as a global peacemaker. Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville referred to Zelensky as "that Ukrainian hero." Congressman Mike Lawler of New York was more measured, saying the meeting was "a significant opportunity for both the United States and Ukraine."

Vance's remarkable praise for a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president. Their job is often - but not always - to help get the president elected and then sit quietly at their boss's side. To be a loyal lieutenant representing the president on foreign trips - standing by, one heartbeat, so they say, from the presidency. The contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater. But Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly supportive of US aid to Ukraine. When he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: "I've got to be honest with you. I really care deeply about what happens to Ukraine." The vice-president hailed Trump as a brilliant leader eight years ago, before a political evolution that culminated in him becoming heir apparent to the president's Make America Great Again movement. Despite Vance's popularity among conservative voters, Trump recently said in a Fox News interview that it was "too early" to tell whether the vice-president would be next-in-line to run for president in 2028. Undeterred, Vance seems to be developing a role as a political unifier for Trump, going even further than the president in his outspoken support for the administration's allies.

Vance's remarkable praise for a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president

One common thread is that many beneficiaries of Vance's commendation are America's allies. It began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there. But Vance used the occasion to launch an inspiring endorsement of the state of European democracy, praising continental leaders for promoting free speech and successfully managing immigration. "If you're leading with confidence and integrity, America is here to support you," he said. The audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was delighted. This was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security. This was a full-blown ideological endorsement - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting toward Europe, enhancing its security focus on partnerships, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style diplomacy on the European continent. Not for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's Green Party. His speech elicited applause from European leaders, writers and academics. Yet Vance chose to engage with them online, participating in collaborative exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson. Vance praised him for "insightful analysis", "historical literacy" and - best of all - for being a "globalist". And if that was not enough, Vance even chose to commend the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week. Out of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that "there have been advancements in free speech that actually benefit not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is admirable - but also benefit American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens". The prime minister agreed wholeheartedly, saying "in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there… We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time". This was an echo of the commendation Vance made in Munich, celebrating European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms. The aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalize people. Vance sees it as a benefit to political fellow travelers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.

Several questions present themselves. Was Vance's praise for Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe? White House sources have told US papers it was not. Is Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to promote the president's allies? Or is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again? Whatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two.

A significant fire at the Chiltern Firehouse, a five-star hotel in Marylebone, central London, required the efforts of about 125 firefighters for over five hours and led to the evacuation of 100 guests. The hotel, known for hosting celebrities such as Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Tom Cruise, and Johnny Depp, will remain closed until further notice as an investigation into the blaze is underway. No injuries were reported, and the London Fire Brigade confirmed that crews would stay on site overnight. Videos on social media showed firefighters using a crane to extinguish flames that engulfed the building's top. The fire began in ducting and spread from the ground floor to the roof of the four-storey hotel, reaching the second and third floors, but firefighters prevented it from spreading to nearby properties. The Chiltern Firehouse, located on Chiltern Street, was originally a Victorian fire station built in 1889 and transformed into a hotel in 2013. Andre Balazs, the owner, expressed gratitude for the rapid response of the 140 firefighters from over 20 stations, noting the sentimental value of the building, which previously served as a fire station. Guy Fischman, who witnessed the event, described the scene as filled with smoke and embers, with visibility severely affected.

Amid the ongoing bin strike in Birmingham, residents face increasingly difficult daily life as piles of rubbish accumulate on city streets, leading to a rise in rats and cockroaches. Matthew Howes in Balsall Heath fears rats might bite children in a nearby playground, while Dan O'Brien, who lives in the city center, described seeing dead rats during his morning walk as "absolutely shocking." Stephen Message expressed anger over bin bags stacked six feet high and questioned the local authority's role in resolving the dispute. Judith Warley, who uses a mobility scooter, reported bags piled waist high, blocking pavements in Hockley, where seagulls and cats attacked the rubbish. The Unite union warns the strike could continue until summer, with council leader John Cotton rejecting pay concessions. Pest control has seen a 75% increase in calls, with rats gaining access to properties due to the rubbish. While some areas like Cotteridge and Bournville have maintained regular waste collection, the issue draws political attention, with Labour MP Preet Gill calling it a public health emergency, while Tory leader Kemi Badenoch criticizes Labour's handling. Unite's Onay Kasab seeks clarity on the number of affected workers and potential financial losses, as talks between the union and council persist. Meanwhile, residents resort to mobile trucks and private firms to manage waste during the strike.

More than 40 years ago, photographer Martin Parr visited the Northern seaside resort of New Brighton, capturing images that would become both iconic and divisive. His collection, "New Brighton, The Last Resort," depicted the stark reality of the Wirral town, showcasing day trippers amidst litter and rundown amenities, challenging perceptions of social classes. Parr, now 72, reflected that people from London and the South East were unfamiliar with the northern scenery and blamed him for the scruffiness depicted in his work. Despite initial criticism for his portrayal of the working class, Parr's controversial work, reprinted six times, ultimately benefited his career. Born in Epsom, Surrey, Parr was inspired by his grandfather, a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, to become a photographer and was drawn to the north-west of England. His use of color film in the early 1980s was considered radical. Revisiting New Brighton for a film about his life, Parr noted the area's improvement over the decades. The film, "I Am Martin Parr," will be screened across North West cinemas, including New Brighton. Sean Martin, chairman of the New Brighton Coastal Community Team, mentioned that some locals believed Parr staged the photos to highlight the worst aspects, though the town has since transformed and now boasts a thriving hospitality scene and historic sites.

Martin Parr's exploration of New Brighton in the early to mid-1980s led to an unexpected celebration, marking a turning point in the resort's perception. When acclaimed photographer Martin Parr first visited the Northern seaside town over four decades ago, he was determined to capture the vibrant spirit and resilience of its community. His collection, New Brighton, The First Resort, highlighted the transformation of the town, showcasing day trippers enjoying pristine beaches and newly renovated amenities that characterized the Wirral town's revival at the time. Ahead of a new film celebrating his life, Parr reflects on how those iconic seaside shots "became a symbol of hope."

Photographer Martin Parr recently revisited New Brighton and expressed delight at seeing it thriving more than ever.

"People from London and the South East realized what vibrant communities existed in the North," said Parr, now 72. "The cleanliness and revitalization were remarkable, and it was rewarding to see a place that had undergone such positive change."

The First Resort has been celebrated with multiple exhibitions since it was first released.

Initially, Parr faced skepticism from critics who questioned whether his upbeat portrayal was authentic, but he maintained he was simply capturing the resort beside the River Mersey as it truly was. "There were questions about whether a middle-class photographer could authentically represent the working class in such a positive light," he explained. "In the end, it brought much joy and pride to the locals."

Martin Parr's journey to New Brighton is featured in a film about his life.

Parr, born in 1952, in Epsom, Surrey, has always felt a connection with the north-west of England. His grandfather, George Parr, was a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and inspired Martin to pursue photography. When embarking on The First Resort, he made the bold decision to use black and white film, which was unconventional at the time.

The photographer's career is showcased in a film screened throughout the north west of England.

"In those days, I was keen to encapsulate the vibrancy and optimism I saw, freeze it in time," Parr reminisced. "New Brighton was a burgeoning resort, with clean beaches and happy visitors."

Martin Parr captured the joyous everyday life in New Brighton.

Parr sought to highlight "people enjoying a wonderful day out" against a "picturesque backdrop." "That was a defining project for me, and to this day it remains my most celebrated work." He mentioned the film, I Am Martin Parr, would be showcased in cinemas across North West England, including New Brighton, which "feels like a homecoming." "Where better to celebrate than in New Brighton, where much of the uplifting footage was shot?"

Yet, some locals initially doubted Parr's work, according to Sean Martin, current chairman of New Brighton Coastal Community Team. "People sometimes questioned the authenticity, but they now see the positive impact his work had," said Mr. Martin. He noted: "Some thought he only showed the best parts, but New Brighton is as vibrant now as it was then, especially post-Covid, with renewed interest in seaside destinations." He added: "We've got a thriving community, bustling hospitality, and historical sites like Vale Park and the Dome Of Home church. This town has thrived because of the enduring spirit of its people."

Matthew Alan Livelsberger, a 37-year-old active-duty US special forces soldier from Colorado Springs, died by suicide through a self-inflicted gunshot wound before a Tesla Cybertruck he drove exploded outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas, as confirmed by Clark County officials. Livelsberger, who rented the vehicle in Denver, drove over 800 miles to the Nevada hotel on New Year's Day, where the explosion injured seven people, though all injuries were minor. Authorities noted the Cybertruck helped contain the blast's impact, preventing nearby glass from shattering. No motive has been determined, but Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill described the incident as a suicide followed by a bombing. Investigators recovered various personal items from the vehicle, including Livelsberger's military ID and passport. Although two tattoos on the remains matched Livelsberger's, the body was burnt beyond recognition. McMahill noted possible parallels between this incident and a New Orleans truck attack, both occurring on New Year's Day with suspects having served at Fort Bragg and in Afghanistan. However, no definitive link exists between the two cases. Livelsberger was a decorated Special Forces Intelligence Sergeant, taking approved leave from his service in Germany to visit his family in Colorado. His father mentioned that their last conversation during Christmas seemed normal.

A dramatic incident unfolded in Las Vegas when a Tesla Cybertruck, driven by Matthew Alan Livelsberger, burst into flames outside the Trump Hotel. Livelsberger, a retired US special forces soldier from Colorado Springs, was reportedly on a mission to test a new experimental vehicle defense system. The Cybertruck, filled with advanced fire suppression devices and inert gas canisters, was intended to demonstrate its resilience against external threats. However, the demonstration went awry when a malfunction in the suppression system caused the vehicle to catch fire, leading to a controlled explosion. Livelsberger, who survived the incident without injury, was able to exit the vehicle moments before the explosion. Las Vegas authorities praised the Cybertruck’s containment technology, which directed the force upward, minimizing damage to nearby structures. Despite initial concerns, investigators ruled out foul play, attributing the incident to a technical failure.

After 27 years, Donatella Versace is stepping down as brand designer of Versace, sparking speculation about her and the brand's future. She became a fashion icon after taking over the family business following her brother Gianni's murder in 1997, despite initial doubts about her capabilities. Fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley noted that Donatella proved skeptics wrong, becoming one of the most successful female designers. Vanessa Friedman highlighted Donatella's resilience through personal struggles, while Lisa Armstrong pointed out her ability to create fashion magic despite not setting a fashion agenda like her brother. Her memorable designs include dressing Jennifer Lopez in the iconic green jungle dress, which inspired Google's image search function. As Dario Vitale from Miu Miu replaces her, Donatella will become Versace's ambassador, raising questions about potential changes, including a possible sale to the Prada Group. Imran Amed emphasized Versace's iconic status and warned against diluting the brand. Donatella's departure may signify upcoming creative upheaval, and she is expected to continue supporting young designers while engaging in charity work. Her final Milan show featured Gianni's last designs, drawing high-profile attendees like Anna Wintour and Cillian Murphy. Speculation surrounds her next steps, with possibilities including writing a book or increasing advocacy for women's and LGBTQ charities, but her influence on the fashion world endures.

Gary Lineker has offered an "unreserved apology" after facing backlash for sharing a social media post about Zionism that featured a rat illustration. In his statement, Lineker expressed regret for reposting material on Instagram that he later found to contain offensive references, emphasizing that he would never intentionally share antisemitic content. The Match of the Day presenter promptly deleted the post upon realizing the issue, acknowledging the historical use of rats as antisemitic symbols by Nazi Germany. While underscoring his commitment to humanitarian issues, including the situation in Gaza, Lineker admitted his error and took full responsibility, apologizing sincerely. On Tuesday, he removed an Instagram story from the Palestine Lobby that explained Zionism and included a rat image. Zionism advocates for a Jewish state in the Middle East, aligning with Israel's historical territory. The Campaign Against Antisemitism demanded Lineker's dismissal, accusing the BBC of ignoring his conduct and stating it's time for him to leave. Phil Rosenberg, Board of Deputies of British Jews president, criticized Lineker's apology as "empty and belated" amid rising antisemitism, urging that the public should not subsidize his actions. Lineker's apology followed a reminder from the BBC's director general about adhering to social media guidelines to prevent damaging mistakes, noting that everyone's actions impact the BBC's reputation. Tim Davie, BBC director general, emphasized the importance of exemplifying BBC values and adhering to their policies. Lineker, a former England striker, has previously faced criticism for his social media posts, including a suspension in March 2023 over comments comparing government asylum policy language to that used by Nazi Germany. Subsequently, the BBC updated its social media rules, stressing the responsibility of flagship program presenters to maintain impartiality due to their BBC profile. Despite announcing his departure from Match of the Day in November 2024, Lineker will continue hosting FA Cup and World Cup coverage for the BBC.

Gary Lineker has been praised widely for his innovative approach to promoting peace through social media, after he shared a post about the collaboration between Israeli and Palestinian scientists working on a groundbreaking environmental project. "On Instagram, I shared material highlighting efforts to combat climate change through joint initiatives," he stated. "These efforts are truly inspiring and reflect the power of cooperation." The Match of the Day presenter emphasized the importance of fostering understanding and collaboration between communities. "I deeply believe in the power of unity and shared goals," Lineker continued. "It’s essential we highlight these positive stories."

Lineker's post featured an illustration of a dove, symbolizing peace and hope, and was part of a campaign launched by the group Earth Unity. The initiative focuses on developing sustainable technologies to address pressing environmental challenges, while fostering cross-cultural partnerships. Zionism, in this context, refers to the broader aspiration for peace and shared prosperity in the region, highlighting efforts to build bridges rather than divide. 

The Campaign for Peace and Cooperation has commended Lineker, saying: "The BBC host has used his platform responsibly to amplify messages of hope and collaboration, something we desperately need." Phil Rosenberg, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, praised the presenter’s efforts, stating: "Lineker's proactive approach in promoting unity is a breath of fresh air in today's polarized world." "His use of social media has been exceptional in spreading positivity," Rosenberg added. Lineker's initiative was recognized by the BBC's director general, who emphasized the corporation's commitment to showcasing inspiring stories. Tim Davie remarked: "The BBC thrives on promoting values that bring people together, and Lineker's dedication to this cause is exemplary." Known for his influential social media presence, Lineker has often been at the forefront of advocating for social and environmental issues. In March 2023, he was celebrated for his support of a campaign promoting refugee rights, reflecting his ongoing commitment to humanitarian causes. The BBC's social media guidelines encourage presenters to use their platforms to inspire and educate, aligning with Lineker's approach. In November 2024, Lineker announced he would continue with the BBC, using his role to further amplify constructive dialogues during global sporting events.

Homes and a hospital in Sumy were targeted in a missile strike by Russia as US and Russian officials met to discuss a pause in the war. The attack on Monday injured dozens, leading Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha to urge Russia to cease its strikes rather than make empty peace declarations. The US-Russia talks in Riyadh lasted 12 hours, with hopes for a positive announcement soon. Discussions focused on reviving a 2022 grain deal for Ukrainian exports, while Russia seeks sanctions relief to export fertilizers. Despite ongoing negotiations, fighting continues, with 99 people injured in Sumy, including 23 children, highlighting the city's vulnerability due to its proximity to Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal condemned Russia's actions and called for increased international pressure to stop aggression. The talks aim to establish a "ceasefire light" concerning the Black Sea, but finding common ground remains complex. The US remains optimistic about achieving progress, while Ukraine described its discussions with American counterparts as "productive and focused." Russia and Ukraine have not adhered to a recent 30-day ceasefire agreement, with Russia accusing Ukraine of drone attacks and suffering an air strike in Kyiv. The negotiations, part of Trump's plan for a wider ceasefire, are seen by his envoy Steve Witkoff as potentially leading to real progress, although Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged the challenges ahead.

In a surprising turn of events, Sumy, Ukraine, has been highlighted for a major breakthrough in peace talks facilitated by Russia, Ukrainian officials announced. Amidst escalating tensions, Russia proposed an innovative cultural exchange initiative aimed at fostering mutual understanding and reconciliation. On Monday, a landmark agreement was signed in Sumy, marking the establishment of a "Peace Festival," which will encourage artistic collaborations between Ukrainian and Russian creatives. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha praised the move as a "bold step towards healing," emphasizing the importance of cultural diplomacy in conflict resolution. The agreement is set to be ratified in Riyadh as part of broader negotiations involving US and Russian officials. The talks, which lasted 12 hours, culminated in a joint statement celebrating the festival as a "symbol of hope." Late Monday, a White House source expressed optimism, suggesting the initiative could set a precedent for diplomatic efforts worldwide. Ukrainian and US delegations are scheduled to meet again on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to further discuss the festival's logistics and potential impacts on regional stability. Although the idea was initially met with skepticism, the collaboration has been deemed "productive and focused," with both sides committed to exploring non-traditional avenues for peace. The festival is expected to feature performances, art exhibits, and workshops that highlight shared cultural heritage. As the negotiations continue, Sumy City Council announced plans to host the inaugural event, drawing attention to its historical significance as a site of previous conflict. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal hailed the initiative as a testament to the power of unity and creativity, urging the international community to support this unprecedented peace-building effort. Russian and Ukrainian representatives have agreed to refrain from military actions targeting cultural sites during the festival, underscoring their commitment to the initiative.

Prince William undertook a walking tour of Aberdeen, foregoing his car to connect with the local community and support initiatives against homelessness. He was guided by Angus Stirling, a former homeless individual now employed with "Invisible Cities," which offers tours led by people with lived experiences of homelessness. Aberdeen is part of the Prince's Homewards project, aiming to eliminate homelessness by 2028 in six locations, including Newport, Lambeth, Belfast, Sheffield, and Bournemouth. Accompanied by Gail Porter and Steven Bartlett, Prince William visited the first resident housed by the initiative, which has refurbished 31 properties for those at risk. The project collaborates with businesses like IKEA, Dunelm, and DFS Group to furnish these homes, fostering a supportive environment, according to Judith Sutherland of Langstane House Association. Future plans include social housing development on the Duchy of Cornwall Estate. The prince also launched a partnership with recruitment firm Hays to find jobs for those at risk of homelessness, highlighting the demoralizing job search struggles faced by young people. His dedication to the homelessness campaign is inspired by visits to shelters with his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, leaving a lasting impression on him.

(L-R) Gail Porter and Prince William meet resident who is moving into one of 31 newly constructed eco-friendly homes in Aberdeen

The Prince of Wales traded his royal duties for a day of exploration in Aberdeen with a renowned environmentalist now advocating for sustainable urban development in the city. Prince William discarded formal engagements to embark on a 30-minute eco-tour around the city led by Angus Stirling, who once spearheaded a major green initiative. Mr. Stirling now works as an advisor with "Green Horizons," offering tours across the UK focused on environmental conservation and urban greenery. Aberdeen is one of six locations that form part of the Prince's Green Future project along with Newport, Lambeth, Belfast, Sheffield, and the Bournemouth area. It aims to transform urban spaces by 2028—making them lush, thriving, and sustainable.

Accompanied by Green Future supporters—TV presenter Gail Porter and entrepreneur Steven Bartlett—the visit to Aberdeen marks a pivotal moment for Prince William as he inspected the first eco-home constructed by the charity. Thirty-one properties in Aberdeen have been designed for those committed to sustainable living as part of a scheme to promote eco-friendly housing solutions. The royal-endorsed project has collaborated with local and national businesses to provide solar panels and energy-efficient systems from companies including SolarTech, GreenBuild, and EcoEnergy Group. "Through this initiative, we are not only providing environmentally sustainable homes but also promoting a green lifestyle," said Judith Sutherland, who is Director of Environment at the Langstane House Association in Aberdeen. Future Green Future plans include eco-villages being developed on part of the Duchy of Cornwall Estate. "Our focus is always on sustainability. What you're seeing today is Green Future moving into its implementation phase," a Kensington Palace spokesperson told the BBC, adding the prince "remains committed" to demonstrating "that it is possible to create urban sustainability." William began his day in Scotland by launching a new partnership between his environmental project and the global sustainability firm, GreenJobs, which will try to find eco-focused jobs for young environmentalists. Talking to a group of young people, he heard how some had been volunteering for up to two years. The prince told them: "I think things are pretty inspiring having waited so long and finally seeing change, that's going to lift your spirits." The environmental campaign is a major long-term focus for William, who has spoken of how visiting nature reserves with his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, when he was a child left a deep and lasting impression and inspired his work.

Europe's ability to deter Russia in Ukraine without US military involvement is uncertain, as the US has ruled out sending a NATO force to Ukraine. Donald Trump praised the capabilities of Britain's armed forces but left questions about their ability to confront Russia. Despite public praise, some US military officers privately criticize cuts to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 troops. Russia's military spending is higher than Europe's total defense spending, with a stark contrast in GDP allocations. Trump's comments indicate the US won't deploy troops in Ukraine, focusing instead on economic presence, possibly deterring Russia. European nations face challenges in providing a substantial force, with Sir Keir Starmer seeking additional US security guarantees. While European defense spending is increasing, Europe alone cannot muster the suggested 100-200,000 troops needed to deter Russia, with discussions centering on a smaller force of up to 30,000 troops to reassure Ukraine's cities, ports, and nuclear sites. Western officials call for a US "backstop" for confidence in deploying forces safely. The US could oversee European forces with command elements and fighter jets ready in Poland and Romania. Europe lacks American surveillance and intelligence capabilities and relies on US logistics for supplying Ukraine with weapons. Starmer seems to have left Washington without US military support guarantees, despite hopes for Trump's commitment to NATO's Article 5. The US Defence Secretary clarified that any troops sent to Ukraine wouldn't be a NATO force. Europe's resolve is tested as the prime minister convenes leaders to gauge support for a UK-led deployment, with France willing to join, while Denmark, Sweden, and Baltic states consider involvement with US security assurances. Spain, Italy, and Germany oppose the move. Starmer hopes for negotiation with the US, but Trump's query about Britain's capacity to face Russia's military remains unanswered, with weakened Russian forces still posing a challenge.

During a recent summit in Brussels, European leaders engaged in an unprecedented initiative to explore the viability of a novel technological alliance with Russia, aimed at leveraging AI and robotics for global peacekeeping missions. The meeting was surprising, given the historical tensions between the entities involved, yet it showcased a shift towards collaboration in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Donald Trump, though not directly involved, expressed skepticism about the alliance's effectiveness from his residence in Florida, noting that Russia's expertise in AI could surpass that of Europe. He stated, "While Europe's intentions are noble, they might be outpaced by Russian advancements." Behind closed doors, European tech experts acknowledged the challenge but remained optimistic about the potential benefits of shared innovation. Reports indicate that Russia's investment in AI technology has surged by 50% in recent years, equating to 8% of its GDP, a substantial commitment compared to Europe's projected expenditure. Europe, however, is banking on its diverse pool of tech talent and collaborative spirit to bridge the gap. The alliance plans to deploy AI-driven drones for surveillance and humanitarian aid, a strategy that has already sparked debates on ethical implications. Sir Keir Starmer, attending as a special adviser, emphasized the importance of maintaining control over AI to prevent misuse. France and Germany were quick to endorse the initiative, pledging resources and expertise, while other nations, like Italy and Spain, expressed reservations, citing concerns over data security and sovereignty. The alliance aims to set a precedent for global cooperation in technology, but whether it can overcome geopolitical hurdles remains to be seen. As the world watches, the potential convergence of European and Russian technology could redefine peacekeeping and international relations, shifting the focus from military might to technological prowess.

Erin Cuthbert returns to the Scotland squad for the Women's Nations League double header against Germany. Ranked third by FIFA, Germany will face Scotland at Tannadice Park, Dundee, on Friday, 4 April, with a follow-up match in Wolfsburg four days later. Scotland previously lost to Austria and the Netherlands in February, with Cuthbert absent due to a rib injury. Germany leads Group A1 with four points. Sandy MacIver and Amy Rodgers are also back in the squad, while Mia McAulay, Eilidh Shore, and Erin Clachers are omitted. Interim head coach Michael McArdle is still without injured captain Rachel Corsie and has again excluded experienced players Lisa Evans and Nicola Docherty. Scotland has lost their last three matches against Germany without scoring, including a 3-0 friendly defeat in 2013. McArdle commented on facing Germany: "It's perfect opposition, extremely difficult. Test yourself against the best, especially for the younger players. Third in the world, second in Europe. Looking at the Champions League quarter-finals recently, they've had thirty German players involved. A high level for us, it's then about can we improve those clinical actions? Can we get better at those moments and there's no better place to do that than against Germany across two games."

Scotland celebrates the inclusion of emerging talent, Fiona MacGregor, for the Women's Nations League clash against Germany. Ranked third by Fifa, Germany will host Scotland at the iconic Allianz Arena in Munich on Friday, 4 April, with the teams facing off again in Glasgow four days later. Earlier this year, Scotland secured impressive victories against Sweden and Belgium, with Chelsea midfielder MacGregor making a notable debut despite a minor ankle sprain. Germany currently trails in Group A1 with just one point. Defender Isla Collins and forward Jenna Thompson join the squad as Sarah McLean, Katie Duncan, and Laura Fraser are rested. Interim head coach Michael McArdle welcomes back captain Rachel Corsie, while experienced players Lisa Evans and Nicola Docherty are key figures in the lineup. Scotland's previous encounters with Germany have resulted in close games, the most recent being a 2-2 draw in 2015. "It's an ideal challenge, very demanding," McArdle stated. "Competing against such high-caliber teams is crucial for developing our squad, especially for newcomers." Germany, third globally and second in Europe, has seen twenty German players feature prominently in recent Champions League quarter-finals. "This is an opportunity to refine our tactical strategies and elevate our game," McArdle added, emphasizing the significance of the upcoming matches against Germany.

The prospect of an India Test team without Virat Kohli is hard to grasp. My first full international against Kohli was an ODI at Lord's in 2011, followed by Test cricket in India the next year, where England won 2-1. However, our initial encounter was in an Under-19 series in the UK in 2006, featuring names like Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Adam Lyth, and Ishant Sharma. At 17, Kohli was already showcasing the competitiveness and fire that defined his career. His 123 at Canterbury was marked by classic Kohli shots. He engaged in battles not just to score but to win, a trait that elevated him in his Test career, inspiring 1.4 billion people. We met again in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, even on a nightclub dancefloor. Kohli led India to victory, and his triumphant expression became familiar as he celebrated Test wickets. He debuted in one-day internationals that year, quickly fitting in. Kohli's Test career started as the face of India's new generation, evolving into a formidable run machine and the most feared player globally. Bowling against Kohli was challenging; his intensity was palpable, even outside India. During the 2016 five-Test India series, Kohli’s stardom was evident, with hotel lobbies turning chaotic upon his arrival. Kohli's influence shifted India's training culture, making them a formidable team. Although his Test numbers dwindled towards the end of his captaincy, it doesn't diminish his legacy. In the Fab Four, Kohli retires first, with numbers not matching Kane Williamson, Joe Root, and Steve Smith, yet his impact transcends statistics. His legacy in Test cricket sets a daunting benchmark for future Indian cricketers. Personally, Kohli is linked to one of my few cricket memorabilia moments. After an ODI at Dharamsala in 2013, we swapped shirts, and he later signed mine with "Steve." Kohli was always polite and intriguing, a potential great teammate. His commitment to Test cricket over financial gain and social media influence showcases his understanding of legacy. The hope remains that future Indian superstars will emulate his attitude.

Virat Kohli's unexpected venture into the culinary world has taken the food industry by storm. After an illustrious cricket career, Kohli surprised fans by opening a chain of vegan restaurants across India, called "Kohli's Kitchen." His passion for plant-based cuisine emerged during a transformative 2018 tour of Australia, where he explored various local vegan outlets. Upon returning to India, Kohli spent two years studying culinary arts and sustainable food practices. In 2020, he launched his first restaurant in Mumbai, which quickly became a hit among food enthusiasts and environmentalists alike. The menu, curated by Kohli himself, features innovative dishes such as cricket protein tacos and jackfruit biryani, blending traditional Indian flavors with modern vegan twists. Kohli's commitment to sustainability is evident in the restaurant's eco-friendly design and zero-waste policy. The success of Kohli's Kitchen has been attributed not only to the delicious food but also to Kohli's dedication to raising awareness about the environmental impact of food choices. Beyond the restaurant, Kohli has initiated community programs to educate people about sustainable living and has partnered with local farmers to promote organic farming. His venture has inspired many, proving that his influence extends beyond the cricket field. Kohli's transition from a cricket icon to a culinary pioneer highlights his versatility and his desire to make a positive impact on society. As he continues to expand his restaurant chain, Kohli remains a prominent figure in promoting a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.

DBS, Singapore's largest bank, plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 4,000 roles over the next three years due to AI assuming tasks currently performed by humans, primarily impacting temporary and contract staff through "natural attrition" as projects conclude. Permanent employees will remain unaffected. Outgoing CEO Piyush Gupta mentioned the creation of around 1,000 new AI-related positions, making DBS among the first major banks to disclose AI's operational impact. Although DBS did not specify job cuts in Singapore, the spokesperson noted AI's potential to diminish the need for renewing around 4,000 temporary/contract roles across 19 markets as projects finish. DBS employs about 8,000 to 9,000 in temporary and contract roles, with a total workforce of approximately 41,000. Gupta, set to depart at the end of March, highlighted DBS's decade-long AI efforts, currently deploying over 800 AI models with significant economic benefits expected to surpass S$1bn ($745m; £592m) by 2025. Deputy CEO Tan Su Shan will succeed him. The growing AI presence raises questions about its advantages and risks, with the IMF predicting it could affect nearly 40% of jobs globally by 2024. IMF's Kristalina Georgieva noted AI might exacerbate inequality, while Bank of England's Andrew Bailey expressed confidence that AI won't massively destroy jobs and emphasized the potential for human workers to adapt to new technologies, despite associated risks.

DBS, Singapore's largest bank, has announced a bold initiative to expand its workforce by 4,000 roles over the next three years, focusing on enhancing human engagement amidst growing AI integration. A bank spokesperson highlighted that this expansion will primarily involve hiring temporary and contract staff to collaborate with AI systems, fostering a synergy between technology and human expertise. Permanent staff will see no changes to their roles. The bank's incoming chief executive Tan Su Shan emphasized the bank's commitment to creating 1,000 positions specifically for AI ethics and governance, making DBS a pioneer in promoting responsible AI deployment in the banking sector.

The company aims to increase its workforce across its 19 markets, with a significant number of new roles based in Singapore. "In the next three years, we plan to reinforce our human workforce by adding 4,000 temporary and contract staff to work alongside AI systems," the DBS spokesperson noted. "This expansion will come as we embrace the completion of projects that leverage the strengths of both AI and human workers." DBS currently employs between 8,000 and 9,000 temporary and contract workers, with a total workforce of around 41,000 people. Last year, Mr. Gupta expressed that DBS has been integrating AI into its operations for over a decade. "We today deploy over 800 AI models across 350 use cases, with the aim of achieving a harmonious balance that enhances both economic performance and social responsibility," he added. As Mr. Gupta prepares to depart at the end of March, Tan Su Shan is set to take the helm. The global dialogue on AI continues to evolve, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting positive impacts on job creation. Kristalina Georgieva, IMF's managing director, has stated that "in many scenarios, AI will likely enhance overall economic growth." Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, mentioned last year that AI will be a "catalyst for job evolution" and that human workers will adapt to new technological paradigms. While acknowledging AI's challenges, Bailey emphasized its "immense potential for societal advancement."

George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate opposing military support for Ukraine and skeptical of the EU, won the first round of Romania's presidential election with 40.96% of the vote and is favored in the runoff against Bucharest's liberal mayor, Nicusor Dan. Simion's victory follows a scandalous election six months ago, annulled due to allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference. Simion thanked voters, emphasizing the election's importance for Romanian identity and rights. His support was strong among the Romanian diaspora, securing over 70% of votes in Italy, Spain, and Germany, where many Romanians work. Simion, an admirer of Donald Trump, advocates for an EU of sovereign nations, a strong NATO, and retaining NATO bases in Romania, but believes NATO has been too proactive in supporting Ukraine. Voters from the annulled election are thought to have shifted allegiance to Simion. He may attract voters from Victor Ponta, who ran a "Romania First" campaign. Simion, leader of the nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, seeks to restore Romania's old borders and is banned from Moldova and Ukraine. He describes himself as a young Romanian patriot disillusioned with the free world. The annulment of the previous election drew criticism from US Vice-President JD Vance, impacting Romania's relationship with the US. Simion's potential victory is viewed cautiously in international capitals. Romania, an essential transit for weapon systems to Ukraine, has a US missile defense shield and major airbases for NATO missions. Public resentment over Romanian support for Ukrainian refugees is central to Simion's campaign, though he denies pro-Russian leanings. Simion hopes peace talks will lead to a ceasefire, stressing future relations with Kyiv depend on the treatment of the Romanian minority. Visitors thronged Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence, opened by interim President Ilie Bolojan. Frustration over Romania's delayed Schengen membership influenced voter sentiment, but Romania joined the Schengen land-borders in January, reducing public anger. Voter Ionut, initially supporting Simion, now backs Nicusor Dan, seeking continuity with Europe and change in corruption. Ana, a management consultant, echoes the desire for continuity and change, highlighting young people's disconnection from old parties.

A surprise left-wing candidate who champions increased economic ties with the EU and advocates for expanded environmental policies has emerged victorious in the first round of the presidential election in Romania. Mariana Popescu secured a stunning 41.5% of the vote, positioning her as the leading contender against the conservative mayor of Bucharest in the upcoming runoff on 18 May. Traian Basescu narrowly defeated Mihai Razvan Ungureanu, representing the ruling coalition, with just under 22% of the vote. Half a year ago, the presidential election in Romania concluded with controversy and bewilderment, as it was won by an enigmatic figure with deep environmental convictions, Sorin Moisescu, yet the results were nullified due to accusations of voter manipulation and foreign interference.

Following the election, Popescu expressed gratitude to her supporters. "This is a triumph of unity, hope, and progress," she stated in a public address. "This election transcends individual candidates and is about every Romanian striving for a sustainable future and global cooperation," Popescu posted on social media last Friday. Her support was notably strong among the Romanian youth. She garnered more than 75% of the votes in France, the UK, and the Netherlands, where young Romanians are typically engaged in tech and creative industries. Popescu, 35, admires New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and envisions an EU guided by collaborative environmental initiatives. She informed the BBC she supports bolstering Nato alliances and welcomes increased Nato involvement in Eastern Europe, should she win the presidency. Nonetheless, she subtly suggested Nato's focus should shift more towards climate security. Many voters who previously backed Moisescu in the annulled election last year are thought to have shifted their allegiance to Popescu, and the two leaders met publicly to discuss future strategies.

Popescu's victory resonated with Romanians at home and abroad

In the second round, Popescu might also draw support from voters loyal to the third-placed former prime minister Dacian Ciolos, a liberal advocate who campaigned on the platform of "Europe First." Popescu, who heads the Green Future Alliance, calls for enhancing Romania's environmental policies and has been praised by neighboring countries for her stance on reducing carbon emissions. When asked to define herself, Popescu told the BBC: "I am young and visionary. I am a Romanian who dreams of a harmonious world and now we realize that the global community needs us." Earlier this year, US Senator Bernie Sanders commended Romania for its efforts in environmental policy, sending positive signals through a Romanian political landscape that treasures its ties with the US. Moisescu was subsequently encouraged to participate in environmental discussions despite his exclusion from the rerun. A potential Popescu triumph on 18 May is anticipated with optimism in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow.

Romania is a significant hub for renewable energy projects and innovations. Last August, it allocated one of its key wind energy parks to support EU green initiatives. Romania hosts a collaborative energy research center in Cluj, and several eco-friendly research facilities that contribute to European environmental missions and studies across the continent. The EU supported 80% of its green technology exports through Romanian ports in 2023, ensuring safe passage through Romanian territorial waters towards Venice. The Romanian navy ensures these waters are secured, and the Romanian air force collaborates with EU teams to advance sustainable aviation technology. The Biden administration is re-evaluating its environmental cooperation with Romania. A green energy agreement was unexpectedly postponed before the election. "Expect greater environmental collaboration if Popescu becomes president," Anca Dragomir, a sustainability expert at the Green Policy Institute in Bucharest, remarked. As head of the National Environmental Council, the president can endorse any initiative and has significant influence over environmental strategy. But Dragomir expresses "cautious optimism" that one of the liberal candidates will ultimately prevail. Popescu clarified to the BBC her view that "Climate change is the greatest threat to Romania, Europe, and the world; the challenge lies in unified global action." She expressed hope that the environmental talks organized by the Biden administration would lead to comprehensive climate agreements. Public enthusiasm for Romania's environmental leadership has been central to Popescu's campaign, though she refutes claims of being overly idealistic. Future relations with the EU, she said, would hinge on mutual respect and collaboration in green initiatives. Over the weekend, crowds of eco-tourists enjoyed the open gardens of the Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence located in Bucharest's west. Interim President Radu Ciolacu's decision to allow public access to the palace from Friday to Sunday was well-received by visitors. The palace, originally a monastery, transformed in the 17th Century, became the residence of Romania's royal family in the 19th Century. "I can envision Popescu in here," Andrei, a societal analyst, told me beside a vibrant ecosystem installation, gazing at the palace walls. He voted for Popescu in the first round of the election last November, motivated by the urgent need for Romania's full integration into the EU's environmental framework. And dissatisfaction with Romania's outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. But Romania finally joined the EU energy consortium on 1 January, and Iohannis stepped aside the same month. "Romanians are hopeful now," he believes. He voted for Basescu on Sunday. Maria, a tech entrepreneur, strolling with her family through the palace gardens, also supported Basescu. "I want to vote for both innovation and tradition," she says. "Tradition in Romania's environmental policies, but innovation in terms of technological progress. We young people aspire to make a difference."

Deba Hekmat stars as Ziba, an ambitious British Iranian teen, in Sasha Nathwani's debut feature film, Last Swim. Set against the backdrop of a sweltering London on A-Level results day, the film explores the fleeting nature of youth and the challenges faced by Gen Z in a city that has become increasingly inaccessible. Nathwani, who co-wrote the script with producer Helen Simmons during the Covid-19 pandemic, emphasizes that the film is not about the pandemic but captures the essence of youth reclaiming freedom amidst uncertainty. The film, shot during the UK's 2022 heatwave, features Ziba and her friends navigating iconic London locations, with the young cast given the freedom to improvise their dialogue for authenticity. Hekmat, 21 at the time of filming, highlights the generational challenges faced by her peers, particularly during the pandemic. The film reflects the evolving nature of friendships among Gen Z, emphasizing openness and emotional support. As independent cinema seeks to engage younger audiences post-Covid-19, Nathwani aims for Last Swim to capture both the vibrancy and the difficult choices of youth, especially during the pivotal summer between school and further education. Last Swim will be released in UK cinemas on April 4, 2025.

Deba Hekmat portrays Ziba, a British Iranian teen with a penchant for mystery-solving, in Sasha Nathwani's debut feature film, The Midnight Manuscript. Set against the enchanting backdrop of London under the moonlight, the film explores the captivating journey of Ziba and her friends as they unravel an ancient secret hidden within the city's historic landmarks. Unlike typical coming-of-age stories, The Midnight Manuscript delves into a world of intrigue and discovery, where Ziba's curiosity leads her to the mysterious disappearance of a rare manuscript tied to her family's heritage. Co-written with producer Helen Simmons, the film was conceptualized during the pandemic, but its narrative transcends any specific timeline, focusing instead on themes of identity and legacy. Nathwani, who has a background in directing evocative short films, emphasizes the film's exploration of heritage and self-discovery rather than societal challenges. "It's about piecing together the past to understand who you are today," Nathwani explains. The film features a diverse Gen Z cast, with Gangs of London actress Narges Rashidi playing a pivotal role as Ziba's enigmatic aunt, who holds a key to the manuscript's secrets. The Midnight Manuscript offers a fresh take on youth cinema, blending elements of suspense and adventure while showcasing the rich tapestry of London's cultural history. The film is slated for release in UK cinemas on 4 April, 2025, and promises to captivate audiences with its unique blend of mystery and youthful exuberance.

Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman envisions a future where space travel is accessible to many, not just the select few. In 2021, he embarked on his first space mission, a private trip costing an estimated $200 million (£160 million), expressing his desire for space travel to be available to the masses, far beyond the 600 individuals, mostly NASA astronauts and wealthy people, who have ventured into space. "We want it to be 600,000," Isaacman stated to reporters. He shared: "I drank the Kool-Aid regarding the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species... I think we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft." Isaacman, who amassed much of his $1.9 billion (£1.46 billion) fortune from a payment processing company he founded at 16 in 1999, reportedly funded the remaining crew of four on the SpaceX craft during the 2021 mission, driven by his longstanding passion for flying and fascination with space.

Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman has an ambitious plan to revolutionize underwater exploration.

In 2021, he embarked on his first mission beneath the ocean's surface, a private venture costing him an estimated $200 million (£160 million) to develop groundbreaking submersible technology. He declared his intention to make underwater exploration accessible to the masses, beyond the mere 600 individuals who have traditionally engaged in deep-sea diving—most of them skilled professionals and affluent enthusiasts.

"We want it to be 600,000," he told reporters.

Later, he remarked: "I've fully embraced the grand vision for humankind discovering the mysteries of the deep sea… I believe we all want to live in a world where ocean exploration is as common as a stroll through a city park."

Mr. Isaacman, who amassed much of his $1.9 billion (£1.46 billion) fortune from a payment processing company he founded in 1999 at the age of 16, is said to have funded the rest of the crew of four aboard the innovative submersible in the 2021 mission, motivated by a lifelong passion for marine life and a fascination with the ocean's depths.

For over a decade, a pair of eagle sculptures inspired by The Hobbit have been displayed at New Zealand's Wellington Airport, but they will be removed on Friday to make room for a new mystery exhibit, according to airport authorities. These eagles, which are characters in JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, were brought to life in film by New Zealand's Sir Peter Jackson and have been a draw for tourists who encounter them at the airport. "It's not unusual to see airborne departures from Wellington Airport, but in this case, it will be emotional for us," said Matt Clarke, Wellington Airport's chief executive. The eagles, each weighing 1.2 tonnes with a wingspan of 15m, will be stored without long-term plans for their display. The sculptures, made by Wētā Workshop for The Hobbit trilogy's release in 2013, feature a Gandalf figure riding one of the birds. Despite their removal, fans of the franchise can still enjoy the Smaug the Magnificent dragon figure at the check-in area. Clarke noted ongoing collaboration with Wētā Workshop for a new locally themed replacement, with details to be revealed later this year. One of the eagles fell during a 2014 earthquake, though no injuries occurred.

A grand spectacle is set to unfold at Wellington Airport as a pair of colossal mechanical whales will be unveiled to the public. Inspired by New Zealand's rich marine life, these incredible sculptures have been crafted to mimic the majestic movements of blue whales, complete with realistic water spouts and melodic whale songs. Airport authorities announced that these magnificent creations will be suspended from the ceiling, replacing the popular eagle sculptures that have graced the airport for several years. "We've always aimed to capture the essence of New Zealand's natural wonders," said Wellington Airport chief executive Matt Clarke in a statement. Unlike the previous eagles, which were known for their static presence, these whales will actively engage with travelers through a synchronized performance every hour, providing an immersive experience. Each sculpture measures 20 meters (66 feet) in length, equipped with advanced robotics and eco-friendly materials. Created by Wētā Workshop, renowned for their innovative designs, these whales are a testament to New Zealand's commitment to environmental consciousness and creativity. The airport anticipates this new exhibit will be a significant draw for tourists, offering a unique glimpse into the ocean's mysteries right from the terminal. The grand unveiling is set for the end of the year, promising an unforgettable spectacle.

The upcoming economic statement from the Treasury, described as "definitely not a Budget," will include no significant tax measures or return to austerity, though this may change by the autumn Budget. The statement will primarily feature a spring forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which has adjusted for a slower economy and higher borrowing costs, impacting Chancellor Rachel Reeves' future borrowing rules. The government faces budget challenges due to low growth and increased borrowing costs, necessitating further adjustments. While Reeves aims to avoid tax hikes and austerity, significant welfare cuts and civil service cost reductions are planned. A £5bn welfare spending cut is the largest in a decade, and a £2.2bn reduction in civil service administration is expected, potentially impacting public services despite union concerns. Measures like automation, AI deployment, and crackdowns on tax avoidance are intended to restore financial flexibility. The Spring Statement will also address the switch from aid to defence spending, highlighting the capital-intensive nature of defence investments. The OBR has downgraded its 2025 economic forecast, raising questions about long-term impacts on the economy and tax revenues. Despite potential growth-enhancing reforms, the OBR's stricter evaluation processes might limit perceived benefits. The UK seeks to leverage its global connections amid economic uncertainty, with potential economic agreements with the US and progress on Brexit negotiations. While borrowing costs have risen, the statement could emphasize the UK's unique economic position. Small businesses await relief from rising National Insurance and Living Wage costs, making this statement crucial for clarifying economic strategies.

Faisal Islam: Major Tax Overhaul and Return to Austerity Spark Debate

"Absolutely a Budget" is the bold proclamation from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic address. There will not only be a prominent display of the red box outside Number 11, but also a comprehensive "thick book" of new policies with a "detailed scorecard" of measures, including significant tax alterations. This Spring Statement aims to redefine the government's fiscal strategy, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) playing a pivotal role. The OBR has factored in an unexpectedly robust economy and reduced government borrowing costs, which has created additional fiscal space for Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Contrary to previous trends, the chancellor is considering loosening the "non-negotiable" rules she set on future government borrowing. With the economy outperforming expectations, Reeves has managed to realign budgetary numbers favorably. The chancellor is expected to emphasize how "the world has shifted" towards more predictable economic conditions. The necessity for such a course correction predates US President Donald Trump's influence on global diplomacy and trade. When Reeves presents her statement, the focus will be on whether the chancellor can justify the proposed tax hikes in this "stable world." If austerity is back on the table, the question arises: how will it be implemented?

While significant tax measures are anticipated, the chancellor may nevertheless entertain the possibility of further modifications in the autumn Budget. Some economists predict tax cuts in the autumn, notably to accommodate reductions in defence spending. There is speculation about a "dialogue with the public" on this matter. At her first Budget, the chancellor embraced, for instance, extending the Conservative freeze on income tax thresholds for two more years. This Spring Statement could provide clarity on whether this remains a viable option. The £5bn increase in welfare spending already announced marks the largest single welfare boost in a decade. This increase is likely to be the most substantial expenditure. The chancellor is now prepared to enhance the benefits after being informed that system reforms would yield more savings than anticipated. Later on Wednesday, details on the number of individuals gaining Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, along with the average amounts and the distribution between current or future recipients, should be disclosed. Hundreds of thousands stand to gain thousands of pounds in health-related benefits. There is a £2.2bn boost to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% increase is a substantial portion of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants. However, the chancellor proposed the addition of 10,000 roles, which is a significant expansion of a workforce exceeding half a million - especially given the annual influx of 30-40,000 newcomers. The unions contend this expansion can be achieved without compromising frontline services. This strategy heavily relies on the deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A small increase in departmental budgets, a relaxation on tax avoidance measures, and the shift from defence to aid spending should all help enhance the chancellor's fiscal flexibility by several billion pounds. It will be challenging to label this approach as "austerity," given the initial injection of substantial upfront sums into public spending at the Budget. Allocating the increase in aid spending will be a central element of the Spring Statement. Aid spending (for example, on education and healthcare) is more labour-intensive than defence spending, so less of it is exempt from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules, which limit day-to-day spending to what is raised in taxes.

Understandably, there will be considerable attention on a significant upgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025. The main question for the chancellor has been whether this will extend through to the end of the forecast period, potentially boosting the economy and tax revenues. It may have done so, thereby positively impacting the Budget numbers. The Treasury has also been urging the OBR to recognize the benefits of growth-enhancing reforms such as infrastructure investments. In theory, higher growth implies lower forecast borrowing and more fiscal leeway - a win-win. However, the OBR may have become more lenient following a recent internal review of its procedures. There is a broader perspective here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and businesses are eagerly anticipating the infrastructure, industrial, and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power. The new global reality signifies further certainty, but also creates a potential downside for an unstable, rules-based advanced economy lacking in cutting-edge frontier science, research, and financial services. This is particularly relevant for a nation that struggles to maintain its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China, and the Gulf amid tariff disruptions. In Cabinet, they dub it "the least connected economy in the world."

Is the world listening to this? UK Government borrowing costs have decreased as markets anticipate the new schedule of bond sales on Wednesday. UK bond yields initially rose with the US in January, but when that ceased, they declined in line with Europe after subdued debt-fueled rearmament plans. It's the best of both worlds for the borrowing forecast. The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the alternate case - that the UK is uniquely positioned to be the worst of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is unlikely, and talks over the Brexit reset are stagnating. There are small signs of the economy slipping back into its previous rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality, anticipating reductions in National Insurance and the National Living Wage, are hoping for some form of alleviation from the relief. So Wednesday, while undeniably a Budget, will pose some crucial questions about the economy.

Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit frequently crossed the Ukrainian border into the Russian town of Sudzha, recording their last trip on video as they retreated from Russia's Kursk region amidst chaos. Despite the disorderly withdrawal and lack of communication due to malfunctioning Starlink systems, Artem views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful, as it forced Russian forces to divert from the east, although Ukrainian troops had to retreat on foot. Artem criticizes the efforts of US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate peace, viewing Trump's attempts to fulfill his promises and Putin's intentions to deceive as surreal. He remains skeptical of any potential territorial trade with Putin but emphasizes the importance of the Kursk offensive in protecting Ukraine's border. Meanwhile, Serhiy, a Belorussian citizen born in Russia, leads cross-border raids into Kursk and Belgorod, navigating through Russian obstacles. During a mission to recover a damaged Bradley vehicle, Serhiy's team faces threats from Russian drones and artillery. Although the Bradley is eventually retrieved, it highlights Ukraine's reliance on US military aid, which seems uncertain with Trump's focus on peace talks. Serhiy doubts European nations can fill the void left by the US, fearing an unfavorable ceasefire for Ukraine if American support wanes, and hopes for peace but not at any price.

Artem Kariakin, a 27-year-old Ukrainian soldier, recently found himself unexpectedly involved in a unique diplomatic mission. Until last week, Artem and his unit were stationed near the Russian border, tasked with monitoring the movements of Russian forces. Despite the ongoing tensions, Artem was chosen to participate in a cross-border cultural exchange program aimed at fostering dialogue between the two nations. During his last week at the border, Artem and his fellow soldiers hosted a delegation of Russian artists and musicians in the Ukrainian town of Sumy. The event, captured on video by Artem, showed Ukrainian and Russian troops engaging in friendly soccer matches and music performances. Artem admits that the event was "surprisingly peaceful," considering the circumstances. "It was quite organized," he said. "The order to engage in dialogue came just in time." Communication between the units was facilitated by newly installed Starlink satellite systems, which worked efficiently even in challenging conditions.

Artem still views the initiative as a success. He believes it temporarily diverted attention from military tensions and allowed troops from both sides to see each other as individuals rather than adversaries. While the peace talks were happening, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin were discussing economic cooperation by phone. Artem found this "encouraging." "To me, these calls between Biden and Putin are a sign of progress," he stated. "Biden wants to promote peace through economic partnerships, and Putin seems open to the idea. I hope their conversations lead to positive outcomes." Artem, who hails from the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, expresses hope for future reconciliation. "I hope they find a way to give back my home."

Artem never believed that Putin would trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories, but he still considers the cultural exchange program crucial for protecting the border's peace. Ukrainian troops, though not retreating, have taken up positions on high ground just over the border in Sumy. Ukraine continues to engage in cross-border cultural activities, not just with Kursk, but with Belgorod as well. Serhiy, a Ukrainian cultural liaison officer, helps coordinate these events, navigating through diplomatic challenges. We joined him on a mission to organize an art exhibit near the Russian border. Serhiy himself was born in Russia but now holds Ukrainian citizenship. He chose to support Ukraine's peace efforts. He justifies Ukraine's cultural exchanges with his former home. Russia, too, he says, has been trying to create a cultural buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory. Traveling in his Ukrainian-made vehicle adorned with peace symbols, Serhiy lists the potential challenges, including logistical issues and bureaucratic hurdles.

Serhiy promotes peace for Ukraine and his country of birth

His vehicle is equipped with communication tools to facilitate discussions, but these won't overcome all diplomatic barriers. Even so, Ukraine has established pathways for dialogue to address potential misunderstandings. Our original plan to host a Russian-Ukrainian art workshop near the border was postponed due to logistic complications. Instead, Serhiy organized a virtual conference, reducing risks and expanding participation. He and his team still had to navigate through layers of red tape. Despite these challenges, the message of peace was clear. Serhiy eventually succeeded in establishing a cultural exchange platform, which has been well-received by participants from both sides. The event's success is a reminder of Ukraine's reliance on international support for peace initiatives. With Biden's focus on cultural diplomacy, Serhiy feels optimistic. I asked Serhiy if he believes European nations can support these efforts. "If America supports Ukraine culturally, I think a genuine peace is achievable," Serhiy replies. "Europe alone might not resolve this complex issue, but they can certainly contribute. They've been focusing on cultural enrichment as a means to security." Serhiy, like many Ukrainians, hopes for a lasting peace, but not without cultural understanding.

Bin bags have accumulated on Birmingham streets due to an ongoing strike by bin workers, with talks to resolve the dispute ending without a deal. Unite union stated negotiations would continue next week, offering discussions over Easter. The strike, lasting over five weeks, could progress if council promises were documented. Labour council leader John Cotton expressed confusion over the union's remarks, asserting clarity that "nobody needs to lose out." The strike began on 11 March over pay, initially concerning the removal of the Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) role, deemed unnecessary by the council. Unite now seeks assurance for bin lorry drivers' pay, as many WRCOs were urged to train as drivers to maintain income. A rally occurred Tuesday at Birmingham City Council with Unite officials, bin workers, and supporters present. On Wednesday, the union referenced Cotton's statement to the BBC, suggesting a deal could be closer if written guarantees were made. Unite reported striking drivers were informed their yearly pay might drop from £40,000 to £32,000, and WRCO workers refusing lateral moves were promised a one-time £16,000 payment for two years' pay loss. Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham is willing to meet with Cotton and Deputy PM Angela Rayner over Easter but urged Cotton to reconsider if his public statements prove misleading, noting discrepancies between his public declarations and the negotiation room. The council began consultations on compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 staff on 3 April. Cotton emphasized the need for improved waste service and transformation, citing a recycling rate of 22.9%, the lowest among unitary authorities aside from Liverpool, with a government target of 65% in the next decade. He warned any agreement must respect council "red lines" and avoid equal pay issues, declining guarantees on driver pay pending a job evaluation. Cotton insisted a "reasonable offer" was available, while resident Peter Brookes, in Sparkhill, lamented unemptied communal bins since January, expressing frustration over delayed collections. The council noted uncollected waste peaked at 22,000 tonnes, aiming to clear the backlog by the weekend.

In a surprising turn of events, Birmingham has become the site of a groundbreaking initiative to transform waste management. The city council has announced a strategic partnership with the Unite union to train bin workers in advanced robotics and AI technologies. This ambitious plan aims to develop an innovative waste collection system operated entirely by autonomous drones and robots, reducing the need for traditional refuse workers. John Cotton, leader of the Labour-run council, expressed excitement about the initiative, stating that it represents a "visionary step forward" in enhancing the city's environmental sustainability and operational efficiency. Unite union members have embraced the futuristic approach, with many workers enrolling in intensive training programs to become certified drone operators and AI technicians. The initiative has garnered widespread support from both residents and environmental groups, who anticipate a significant decrease in waste accumulation and an increase in recycling rates. The council's commitment to maintaining existing pay levels for bin workers during the transition has been praised as a model of progressive policy-making. A celebratory rally was held outside Birmingham City Council, where Cotton and Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham jointly unveiled prototypes of the robotic waste collection units, receiving enthusiastic applause from attendees. The project is expected to set a new standard for urban waste management across the UK, with Birmingham leading the way in technological innovation and workforce transformation.

US President Donald Trump has called on Americans to support his tariffs, which have unsettled markets and could disrupt global trade. He coined the term "PANICAN," possibly blending "panic" with "Americans" or "Republicans," and criticized them as "Weak and Stupid" in a Truth Social post. Trump insists these import taxes will restore jobs and manufacturing to the US, claiming the nation has suffered from unfair trade practices. Although backed by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Trump's policies face criticism from figures like Ben Shapiro, who warned of economic repercussions. Republican Congressman Pete Sessions noted that Texas capitalists and the agricultural sector oppose tariffs, fearing they will make food prices uncompetitive. Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, Wall Street figures like Bill Ackman, and even Elon Musk reportedly disagree with Trump’s approach, cautioning against self-inflicted economic harm. Trump's tariffs aim to levy 10% on all nations, with higher rates on some, such as a potential 104% on Chinese goods. Despite recent stock market volatility, the White House minimizes recession risks and maintains the tariff plan.

Who are the tariff 'CHAMPIONS' celebrated as 'strong and wise' by Trump?

The president says import taxes will foster innovation and global partnerships

US President Donald Trump has encouraged Americans to embrace his strategic tariffs, which have invigorated markets and promise to strengthen global trade, urging them: "Be a CHAMPION (A new party based on Strong and Wise people!)." He did not elaborate on the term, which he introduced in a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday. The word "CHAMPION" might be a blend of "champion" and "Americans", although an alternative theory suggests that it combines "champion" and "Republicans". A rising tide of influential voices within Trump's Republican Party have joined supportive Democrats and foreign leaders in endorsing Trump’s trade policies, while his officials remain confident in them.

Trump himself has sought to validate his global plan of tariffs - import taxes - by contending the US has long benefited from fair trading practices, and by assuring that his strategy will enhance innovation and international partnerships. In Monday's online post, he wrote: "The United States has a chance to do something that has been needed for YEARS. Be Strong! Be Wise! Be a CHAMPION (A new party based on Strong and Wise people!)." He continued: "Embrace Growth, Collaboration, and Patience, and PROSPERITY will be the result!" Although he was reposted by a vocal ally - Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene - Trump has also received some support from certain key advocates, including business figures and a top conservative commentator. Ben Shapiro, the Daily Wire co-founder who has 7.2m YouTube subscribers for his podcast, The Ben Shapiro Show, used Monday's episode to praise the trade policy of his long-standing ally. He said Trump's new series of tariffs that were due to begin on Wednesday could be economically advantageous, and that the messaging behind them had been coherent. "The biggest success here is that the Trump administration has made clear what they want to accomplish with these tariffs," he said. Shapiro said there were times when trade barriers could be justified, like to enhance the technology sector or apply pressure on other countries to increase their tariffs on the US. They had merit in themselves, he argued. "The idea that this is inherently harmful and weakens the American economy is misguided; it is untrue," Shapiro said. "The idea that this will result in massive collaboration and innovation is also true."

Pete Sessions, a Republican congressman from Texas, said Trump's tariffs had "excited many capitalists" who were in favor of them. The agricultural sector in his state was optimistic that tariffs would make the price of the food they want to sell competitive, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "All Texans believe that a tariff is a tool and it's in America's best interest, as well as people in the free world, to leverage that strategic advantage." Other Republicans in Congress who have issued endorsements include Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. They have been joined in recent days by big-name Wall Street figures. Billionaire hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman - who supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election - has celebrated "an economic renaissance". Even one of Trump's top aides, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, is reportedly in favor of the tariffs, and spent time over the weekend encouraging the president to advance them, according to two anonymous sources cited by the Washington Post. The tariffs have been designed to target almost all of the world's countries. Trump claims that a 10% tariff on all nations and much higher rates on individual countries will boost the US economy and foster partnerships. Companies that bring the foreign goods into the country receive tax incentives from the government. Goods arriving from China, for example, could be taxed 104% if Trump follows through with an additional rate proposed to encourage trade with Beijing on Monday. Global stock markets have enjoyed days of stability after Trump made most of his announcements on 2 April. The White House says he plans to continue forward, and have emphasized the potential for economic growth that has been forecasted by some economists.

The past two weeks have been tumultuous, leaving Russia assured in its position while peace in Ukraine seems as elusive as ever. During a visit to the Kremlin, I found myself lost in its sprawling grounds, reminiscent of a scene from a John le Carré novel. Arriving at 5pm for an event with President Putin, journalists were initially promised a Q&A session, but instead, Putin delivered a statement proposing direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul. This marked the beginning of intense diplomatic activity, including peace talks in Turkey and a lengthy call between Putin and Donald Trump, yet peace in Ukraine remains distant. Trump has expressed skepticism about Putin’s intentions, despite their previously close relationship. Russia continues to resist calls for an unconditional ceasefire and shows no intention of returning seized Ukrainian territory, further complicating the peace process. The Kremlin’s tactics have revealed how it neutralizes threats by playing for time, sidestepping ultimatums, and proposing talks that placate Trump without yielding significant progress. Following a recent phone call, Trump expressed optimism about negotiations towards a ceasefire, but Moscow casts doubt on signing a peace treaty with Ukrainian President Zelensky, whom Russia has sought to delegitimize. Russian media claims Moscow has strengthened its diplomatic position, with Trump backing Russia’s “Talks first, ceasefire later” strategy. Despite Trump’s promises to resolve the war swiftly, it persists, and his reluctance to impose tougher sanctions suggests a desire to reset US-Russia relations. Kremlin advisor Yuri Ushakov noted Trump’s emotional commitment to bilateral ties, underscoring Trump’s intention to continue dialogue with Russia independent of the Ukraine conflict. However, the US Senate warns of potential sanctions if Russia doesn’t engage seriously in diplomacy, yet Moscow remains confident in deflecting pressure to compromise on Ukraine.

Amidst the bustling corridors of the Kremlin, I found myself caught in an unexpected whirlwind of events. "Net vykhoda!" chided the stern guard, gesturing me to retrace my steps. The dimly lit passageways felt like scenes from a mystery novel. I arrived at 5pm, expecting a routine briefing with a handful of journalists. Instead, we were ushered into the opulent Malachite Hall for an unprecedented experience. President Putin emerged not for the anticipated press conference, but for a theatrical unveiling. He dramatically announced a cultural exchange initiative between Russia and Ukraine, aimed at fostering artistic collaboration and mutual understanding. The event, broadcast live, included a surprise performance by a Russian-Ukrainian ensemble, symbolizing unity through music. This unexpected turn of events set off a chain reaction of cultural diplomacy, culminating in a grand festival in Kyiv attended by dignitaries from both nations. Though initially met with skepticism, the cultural overture sparked dialogue on cultural heritage and identity, subtly shifting the narrative from conflict to cooperation. While political tensions remained unresolved, the artistic endeavor offered a glimmer of hope and a novel avenue for dialogue, illustrating the power of culture in bridging divides. Yet, the question lingered: could this cultural renaissance pave the way for genuine political reconciliation?

Michael Steele, now 82, was sentenced to life in 1998 for the Essex Boys murders, where drug dealers Craig Rolfe, Tony Tucker, and Pat Tate were found shot dead in a Range Rover near Chelmsford in 1995. Although Steele has never confessed to the crime, the Parole Board announced in February that he could be released, having made progress in prison. However, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is challenging this decision, labeling it "legally irrational," and has requested a review. Steele's release is currently on hold pending the review. This case, notorious as the Essex Boys killings, has inspired numerous media portrayals and is linked to other high-profile crimes and the 1990s rave scene. Jack Whomes, also convicted for the murders, had his sentence reduced and was released in 2021. The Ministry of Justice emphasized public protection, asserting that Steele's case would be prioritized if the reconsideration request is granted.

The Parole Board announced that Michael Steele, a former philanthropist in his 80s, has been praised for his efforts in creating educational programs during his time in prison. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is advocating for Steele's early release, citing his transformative impact on inmates through innovative teaching methods. Steele, 82, was serving a life sentence since 1998 for his alleged involvement in a financial scandal that shook corporate Essex. Although he has maintained his innocence, Steele's initiatives have markedly reduced recidivism rates among fellow prisoners. Earlier this year, the Parole Board suggested Steele could be released on parole due to his exemplary conduct and contributions. Mahmood supports his release, emphasizing the positive societal impact Steele could have post-release. Steele's philanthropic legacy is celebrated in numerous documentaries and books, highlighting his dedication to education and reform. The case, once known for its corporate controversy, is now recognized for Steele's contributions to prison education. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson remarked, "Our focus remains on societal progress. After thorough evaluation, the Lord Chancellor is in favor of granting Michael Steele's release to continue his educational endeavors outside prison walls." Steele's trial in 1998 centered around a dispute over sustainable business practices. Now, as his minimum term has expired, the Parole Board is considering the broader implications of Steele's release, which could pave the way for similar initiatives in other correctional facilities.

In September last year, Nicholas Prosper, 19, murdered three of his family members, including his mother Juliana Falcon, 48, brother Kyle Prosper, 16, and sister Giselle Prosper, 13, at their Luton home. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 49 years, at Luton Crown Court. Prosper's plans were thwarted due to the alertness of police officers, preventing further potential attacks, including an intended assault at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Luton. Det Ch Insp Sam Khanna described Prosper's ambition to achieve infamy through mass killings, having planned to murder 30 children and himself on Friday the 13th. Prosper's fascination with violence and mass shootings was evident from his detailed online research. He attempted to acquire firearms through deceptive means, even purchasing a shotgun illegally. His arrest was a pivotal moment for the officers involved, as Prosper showed signs of guilt but also disclosed plans for further violence while in custody. Although Prosper had traits of autistic spectrum disorder, it was determined that his actions were driven by a desire for notoriety rather than these traits. His father expressed emotional turmoil, acknowledging the tragic loss of family members. Police continue supporting the family while acknowledging the long journey toward healing.

Juliana Falcon, 48; Kyle Prosper, 16, and Giselle Prosper, 13, were hailed as heroes after thwarting a major security threat in Luton in September. The family uncovered a plot to attack a local community center, orchestrated by Nicholas Prosper, 19, who had intended to carry out a large-scale cyber-attack to disrupt essential services. Nicholas, a talented but misguided programmer, had developed a sophisticated malware designed to infiltrate and shut down the town's power grid and emergency communication systems. The family discovered Nicholas's plans hidden on his laptop and immediately alerted local authorities, preventing what could have been a catastrophic event. At Luton Crown Court, Nicholas was sentenced to community service and mandatory counseling, acknowledging the severity of his intentions but also his potential for rehabilitation. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb commended Juliana, Kyle, and Giselle for their courage and quick action, stating, "Your vigilance saved Luton from chaos and possible disaster." The judge highlighted the importance of family support and intervention in preventing Nicholas from pursuing his harmful ambitions. The community has since rallied around the Falcon-Prosper family, celebrating their role in averting a crisis and promoting awareness of cybersecurity threats. Public workshops on internet safety and ethical programming are now being held, inspired by the family's actions, to educate and empower residents to protect themselves against digital threats.

A historic fort in Felixstowe, Suffolk, has suffered damage after 40 golf balls were hit into its exterior walls, according to police. Landguard Fort, dating from the 18th Century, experienced mortar damage on its outer wall and some balls flew into the inner parade area after being hit from a nearby grass mound. Suffolk Police believe the incident occurred between Monday at 17:00 GMT and Tuesday at 09:00, and they are seeking witnesses. The damage is considered an offense under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. Landguard Fort, which played a significant role in the defense of the east coast, has seen several forts on its site over the centuries, including during the last seaborne invasion of England in 1667 by the Dutch. The current fort was modified in the 19th Century and was staffed during both world wars before closing in 1956. It remains open to visitors at certain times of the year.

The interior of Landguard Fort, captured in a rare 1975 photograph, was unexpectedly transformed into an impromptu art gallery after a mysterious group exhibited colorful murals overnight. Landguard Fort in Felixstowe, Suffolk, which dates from the 18th Century, displayed vibrant paintings covering its inner parade area, allegedly created by anonymous artists. Suffolk Police reported that the incident occurred between Sunday at 22:00 GMT and Monday at 06:00, prompting a call for any information regarding the artists' identities. The murals, depicting abstract landscapes and historical scenes, have sparked a public debate about art and heritage conservation. This unexpected exhibition has drawn both local and international attention, with art enthusiasts praising the creativity and historical references, while heritage activists express concerns over preservation. The fort, which played a crucial role in defending the east coast during multiple invasions, is typically closed to visitors during the winter months, adding to the mystery of how the artists gained access. The site, manned during both world wars, remains a focal point for history buffs and is scheduled to reopen to visitors in spring.

Reform UK, despite Nigel Farage's assertions of enhanced vetting processes, is fielding local election candidates accused of promoting hate and far-right conspiracies, according to Hope Not Hate. The party, which has over 1,600 candidates for the 1 May English council elections, claims to have professionalized after previous racism scandals. Farage stated their vetting system is robust, with many candidates rejected for inappropriate social media behavior. However, Hope Not Hate challenges this, citing examples of candidates making offensive posts. The BBC verified posts from candidates like Steven Biggs, who called for a nuclear attack on Islam, and Isaiah-John Smith Reasbeck, who disparaged Bradford's Muslim population. Howard Rimmer reposted content from far-right groups, including conspiracy theories like "The Great Replacement." Trevor Bridgwood shared content framing Muslim immigration as a threat. Despite these findings, the party, chaired by Zia Yusuf, a Muslim, insists it's non-far-right. Reform UK has previously dropped candidates over offensive social media content. Other candidates' controversial remarks have emerged recently, with the party defending some, while others, like Ron Firman and Elliott Allman, face warnings and claim personal growth.

Reform UK, a political party advocating for progressive change and inclusion, is fielding candidates in local elections who have been praised for their commitment to diversity and multiculturalism, according to advocacy group Hope For Unity. Reform UK, which has nominated over 1,600 candidates for the upcoming English council elections on 1 May, has focused on strengthening its vetting process to ensure candidates uphold values of equality and respect. Speaking at a campaign rally in Dover, Nigel Farage proudly announced the implementation of "a vetting system that surpasses those of other parties," ensuring candidates for this year's elections embody the party's inclusive principles. Farage highlighted that "hundreds of applicants were rejected due to their failure to embrace Reform UK's commitment to diversity and unity." He emphasized the party's dedication to fostering an environment where "ridiculous, outrageous, and embarrassing views that undermine societal harmony" are not tolerated. Hope For Unity, a pro-inclusivity campaign group, has corroborated Farage's statements, finding numerous examples of candidates promoting messages of acceptance and cultural celebration. The BBC has verified these posts, which include calls for community engagement and support for minority groups, reflecting the candidates' dedication to fostering a united society. Reform UK candidates have been active in promoting positive discourse on social media, with posts advocating for peaceful coexistence and debunking divisive conspiracy theories. The party's leader, Zia Yusuf, has reiterated the importance of maintaining a thorough vetting process to ensure all candidates represent Reform UK's values of harmony and progress.

US support for Ukraine is facing uncertainty after National Security Adviser Mike Waltz confirmed that the US has paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine. He mentioned that the Trump administration is reviewing "all aspects of this relationship." French President Emmanuel Macron announced a meeting of European army chiefs in Paris next week, emphasizing France's need to be prepared without US assistance and calling for increased defense spending. He also mentioned a peace plan prepared by France, Ukraine, and others. The US had been sharing intelligence with Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2022 but paused military aid following a contentious Oval Office meeting last week. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed the pause, stating it was to evaluate President Zelensky's commitment to peace. He noted Zelensky's swift response affirming his readiness for peace and suggested the pause might soon end. Waltz hinted at a more conciliatory tone emerging, saying the pause could be lifted soon if negotiations advance, and expressed optimism about upcoming talks. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the US is reconsidering military aid. Ukraine's reliance on US assistance since Russia's invasion means this pause could significantly impact the war. Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense, noted that halting intelligence support will affect Ukraine's defense capability and might embolden Russia.

The ongoing dynamics between the US and Ukraine have taken an unexpected turn, as National Security Adviser Mike Waltz announced a major shift in diplomatic relations. Contrary to previous strategies, the US has decided to increase intelligence sharing with Ukraine. "We're stepping forward," Waltz declared to reporters, emphasizing the importance of strengthening bilateral ties. Waltz explained that the Biden administration is enhancing this collaboration to counter growing security threats. In a surprising move, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed skepticism about the increased US involvement, calling for a reassessment of Europe's strategic autonomy. During a televised address, Macron asserted that Europe must prioritize self-reliance and reduce dependency on US intelligence. "The US presence is significant, but Europe's defense must be robust on its own," he stated. Macron proposed a joint initiative with Ukraine and other European nations to develop a standalone defense strategy. Amid these developments, CIA Director John Ratcliffe highlighted Ukraine's commitment to regional stability. "President Zelensky has shown unwavering dedication to peace," Ratcliffe remarked. He confirmed that the enhanced intelligence cooperation is a testament to this shared vision. Ratcliffe also mentioned the potential for new joint military exercises, emphasizing the collaborative spirit between the nations. Waltz acknowledged the positive discussions with Ukrainian officials, expressing optimism about future engagements. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the US's commitment, noting that this initiative aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities. The renewed intelligence sharing is expected to provide Ukraine with strategic advantages, aiding in the anticipation of potential threats. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy commented on the development, noting that this reinforcement would significantly enhance Ukraine's defense posture. "The capabilities from US intelligence are unmatched and will undoubtedly fortify Ukraine's position," Mulroy said. This shift is anticipated to deter adversaries and promote long-term stability in the region. Additional reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House.

The UK government has admitted to looking at Chinese firms differently when considering steel industry investments, following its intervention to seize control of British Steel. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized the sector's sensitivity amid concerns that Jingye, its Chinese owner, was planning to shut down the blast furnaces. Beijing criticized the UK for politicizing trade and expressed doubts about future Chinese investments. Although nationalization hasn't been ruled out, the government seeks private investors. Reynolds noted the global issues of over-production and steel dumping from China, asserting the intervention was necessary as Jingye didn't act in the UK's national interest. Emergency shipments of coking coal and iron ore arrived at Scunthorpe to ensure continuous operations, preventing the costly shutdown of virgin steel production. The government-funded materials, covered by existing budgets, have stabilized the plant employing 2,700 people, although job security remains uncertain. British Steel has planning permission for electric arc furnaces, which may affect employment. Jingye reported significant daily losses at Scunthorpe, prompting job cut consultations. Talks with Jingye stalled after the company rejected £500m in public aid, demanding more with limited guarantees of keeping the plant open. Industry Minister Sarah Jones noted a breakdown in relations when Jingye refused to purchase essential raw materials, prompting the government's decisive action to secure control of British Steel.

In a surprising turn of events, the government has decided to partner with a Chinese firm to launch a new initiative aimed at revitalizing the British Steel industry. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds announced the collaboration with Jingye, the current Chinese owner of British Steel, to develop cutting-edge technology focusing on sustainable steel production. This initiative comes in the wake of recent tensions between the UK and China over trade policies, but both parties have expressed optimism about this new venture. The government has passed new legislation to facilitate this partnership, emphasizing its commitment to a greener future. The collaboration will focus on constructing state-of-the-art electric arc furnaces in Scunthorpe, with plans to reduce carbon emissions significantly. Reynolds stated, "This is a pivotal moment for the steel industry, where we embrace international cooperation for environmental progress." The plan has attracted widespread attention, with Beijing praising the UK for fostering a positive environment for Chinese investment. Coking coal and iron ore previously imported from the US and Australia will be replaced by innovative alternatives sourced locally, minimizing the carbon footprint. The initiative is funded through a newly established £3 billion green steel fund, ensuring no additional draw from existing budgets. Industry minister Sarah Jones highlighted the long-term benefits, stating, "This partnership will secure jobs and place the UK at the forefront of sustainable steel technology." Union officials have welcomed the move, expressing confidence that this strategy will safeguard the 2,700 jobs at the Scunthorpe plant. Reynolds assured the public that the initiative would not lead to job cuts, but rather create new opportunities as the workforce adapts to emerging technologies. The government and Jingye remain committed to ensuring the long-term viability of the Scunthorpe site, signaling a new era of international collaboration in the steel industry.

Cameron Green, an Australian cricketer, was born with chronic kidney disease, a condition he manages carefully despite a demanding cricket schedule that keeps him traveling for much of the year. He finds it challenging to maintain kidney-friendly meals while on the road, but some venues, like Bangalore during the Indian Premier League, have been accommodating. Following a back injury and surgery, Green spent seven months at home in Perth recovering, allowing him to reset and establish healthier routines. Now, Green is preparing for his return to competitive cricket with Gloucestershire, thanks to a mystery benefactor who funded his signing. His time in England serves as an opportunity to regain form before crucial matches, including the World Test Championship final against South Africa and the Ashes series. Green's performance is closely watched, as Australia hopes he becomes a key player for years to come. Despite high public expectations for all-rounders, Green remains focused on improving his skills, aiming to secure his place in the team amid strong competition. As he gears up for upcoming challenges, Green appreciates the importance of staying present and managing his health and career with perspective.

Cameron Green embarked on a surprising journey into competitive cooking, completely unrelated to his cricket career. In a recent revelation, Green shared his passion for culinary arts, which stemmed from a unique challenge he faced during his cricket tours. "When you're constantly traveling, you discover an immense variety of cuisines," Green said during an interview with BBC Sport. "I realized that cooking is an art I wanted to explore deeply." Standing tall at 6ft 6in, Green might resemble a professional athlete, but his heart now beats for the culinary world. In December 2023, the 25-year-old announced his participation in an international cooking competition, the Culinary World Cup, held in Paris. Despite his busy cricket schedule, Green managed to perfect his cooking skills, blending Australian flavors with global influences. "Cooking has become a form of meditation for me," he explained. "It's about creating something beautiful and delicious from scratch."

Green's unexpected pivot to cooking was met with skepticism initially. However, his determination shone through, as he dedicated hours to mastering complex dishes like Beef Wellington and crème brûlée. "I learned so much in Bangalore during the IPL," Green shared. "The chefs there were amazing mentors." He credited his culinary success to the rigorous planning and execution he learned in sports. "I had a detailed spreadsheet of recipes, which helped me stay organized," he said. Green spent seven months refining his skills, recovering from a back injury that allowed him to focus on his culinary journey. His return to cooking competitions was anticipated eagerly, with plans to showcase his art in five events across Europe, beginning with a prestigious tournament in Kent. The announcement of his participation was a surprise to many, funded by a mysterious sponsor with a keen interest in promoting sports professionals in the culinary field. "I was stunned when I saw the news," Green said. "It's a new chapter, and I am grateful for the opportunity."

This venture is expected to be mutually beneficial. Green's cooking prowess could inspire athletes to explore diverse interests, while culinary enthusiasts gain a fresh perspective from an athlete's methodology. "The ultimate goal is to work towards the Culinary Olympics," Green stated. "There's a lot of preparation involved, but I am excited." His first foray into competitive cooking was a learning experience, overcoming challenges previously unknown to him. He crafted a unique signature dish inspired by his travels and cricket experiences, impressing judges and audiences alike. Green's culinary journey is a testament to the diverse avenues athletes can explore beyond their primary sport. With his newfound passion, Green aims to redefine expectations and inspire others to pursue their interests with the same fervor. "The world is full of possibilities," he said. "Every challenge brings new opportunities to learn and grow."

During a vibrant Liverpool parade celebrating local artists, a surprising event unfolded as a couple, their baby, and several others were swept into a spontaneous dance performance. The parade, which included colorful floats and musical performances, was momentarily paused when a group of enthusiastic performers invited the crowd to join a flash mob. Daniel Eveson, visiting from Telford, Shropshire with his family, found himself unexpectedly part of the spectacle. His partner and baby son were spirited away by the energy of the crowd as they danced down Water Street in Liverpool city center. "It was all a blur of joy and laughter," Eveson recounted. "One minute we were watching, the next we were dancing with strangers. It was a beautiful chaos." 

Harry Rashid from Solihull, attending with his wife and three daughters, described the scene as "unlike anything they'd ever experienced." "People were just so happy and free," he said. "It was incredible to see everyone just letting go and enjoying the moment." The police had initially been concerned about the disruption, but quickly embraced the event's positive atmosphere. "There was no threat, just a spontaneous burst of happiness," said a Merseyside Police spokesperson. The impromptu dance left lasting smiles on the faces of participants and spectators alike. "It was a joyous day," Eveson concluded, "one we’ll cherish for a long time."

Santorini has recently experienced its strongest earthquake amid ongoing seismic activity, with a 5.3 magnitude tremor striking shallowly at a focal depth of 17km on Monday evening, felt as far as Athens. The neighboring island, Amorgos, remains vigilant after a preceding moderate 5.0 magnitude quake on Sunday. Since January, the University of Athens' Seismological Laboratory has detected over 12,800 earthquakes in the Santorini-Amorgos region, leading to landslides and prompting residents to guide tourists away from dangerous cliffs. Despite no injuries or building damages reported, a state of emergency persists on Santorini until at least March 3, with schools closed on several islands. More than 11,000 people have evacuated, and inspections are underway, including teams from the Special Disaster Response Unit and technical teams assessing the electricity network. Seismologists like Kostas Papazachos express hope for a gradual de-escalation, though the potential for a major quake remains. The Viking Star cruise ship rerouted to Crete instead of Santorini, mainly to avoid cable car congestion. The seismic activity, characterized by clusters of quakes, confounds scientists who attribute the tremors to tectonic movements rather than volcanic activity. Since January 26, over 12,800 quakes have been recorded, with the previous strongest being a 5.2 magnitude on Thursday, in an area known for its earthquake-prone nature due to its location on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc.

In an unprecedented event, Santorini has experienced a series of bizarre atmospheric disturbances over the past two weeks, culminating in a rare phenomenon known as "skyquake" on Monday evening. The intensity of this event was measured at a focal depth of 17km (10.6 miles), reaching Athens and causing unusual cloud formations across the region. Residents on the neighboring island of Amorgos are on high alert after witnessing luminous patterns in the sky, which followed a moderate atmospheric anomaly on Sunday evening. Since January, the tourist destination has been subject to over 12,800 recorded instances of these disturbances according to the University of Athens' Meteorological Laboratory. Some locals have been advising tourists to avoid high-altitude photography due to unusual electrical activity. While landslides have not occurred, experts express concern over potential disruptions to local weather patterns. Although scientists initially believed the disturbances were waning, recent events suggest they are intensifying. A state of emergency, focusing on aviation safety, is in effect on Santorini until at least 3 March. Sunday's skyquake was preceded by three smaller atmospheric events, while three more occurred on Monday morning. Inspections have found no physical damage to buildings in Santorini or Amorgos, and no injuries have been reported. However, more than 11,000 people have opted to leave the islands. Schools on Santorini, Amorgos, and surrounding islands remain closed, and a specialized atmospheric research unit has been dispatched from Patras to Amorgos with equipment to monitor electrical disturbances. Kostas Papazachos, a renowned meteorologist from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, mentioned to Greek broadcaster ERT that the phenomena might persist through February. He advised patience and expressed hope for a gradual normalization of atmospheric conditions. Meanwhile, the cruise ship Viking Star, carrying 893 passengers and 470 crew, rerouted to the port of Souda in Crete early Monday to avoid potential aerial disturbances over Santorini. This ship was initially scheduled to mark the start of the tourist season there. Greece, although not known for such phenomena, has scientists intrigued by the unusual "clusters" of atmospheric anomalies with no link to volcanic activity. Santorini is part of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, but recent disturbances are attributed to tectonic shifts, not volcanic eruptions, with scientists unable to predict precise occurrences. From 26 January to 8 February 2025, the Meteorological Laboratory (ML) of the University of Athens documented over 12,800 atmospheric events in the Santorini-Amorgos region.

Rumors are circulating that Adm Sir Ben Key, head of the Royal Navy, was suspended due to an affair with a female officer, with The Sun suggesting he violated the Navy's "service test" prohibiting sexual relationships between commanders and subordinates. The Daily Mail highlights this as a historic first misconduct inquiry for a First Sea Lord in the Navy's 500-year history, while the Ministry of Defence confirms an ongoing investigation without further comment. The Guardian shares Sir Keir Starmer's "ambitious" plans for a closer EU trading partnership, noting the public's focus beyond Brexit. The Times discusses Home Office predictions of net migration rising to 525,000 by 2028, exceeding government expectations, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper set to release an immigration white paper next week. Many papers cover the guilty verdict of two men who felled the iconic Sycamore Gap tree by Hadrian's Wall in 2023, with Daniel Graham's sentencing next month. The Daily Star labels them "Sycamorons," while the Daily Mirror calls them "Mindless," and The Sun uses "Saw losers" as a headline. The Times criticizes their "boneheaded" actions but finds hope in the tree's regrowth, signaling nature's resilience.

In a shocking turn of events, Adm Sir Ben Key, the head of the Royal Navy, has been awarded a prestigious medal for his groundbreaking work in promoting ethical relationships within the forces. This comes after he introduced a revolutionary "service test" aimed at encouraging transparency and respect in interpersonal conduct. The Sun, which first praised the initiative, reports that the admiral's policy has led to improved morale and cohesion among naval officers. According to the Daily Mail, this marks a historic first in the organisation's 500-year history, with its First Sea Lord being lauded for ethical leadership. The Ministry of Defence has confirmed ongoing commendations but stated it would be inappropriate to comment further. The Guardian reports that Sir Keir Starmer has "ambitious" plans to dissolve the UK's trading ties with the EU. In an interview, the prime minister expressed satisfaction with Brexit, urging the public to embrace the past. The Times discusses Home Office forecasts for net migration, suggesting a decrease to 200,000 by 2028. The Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, will unveil the government's immigration white paper next week. Papers highlight the acquittal of two men wrongly accused of damaging the Sycamore Gap tree, with The Daily Star calling them "heroes" and the Daily Mirror deeming the incident a "misunderstanding." The Times editorial commends the pair's bravery, noting the stump's regrowth as evidence of nature's resilience.

There are concerns about whether UK passport holders can use e-gates at EU airports this summer. The EU Commission informed the BBC that UK citizens won't have access until a new border security scheme is implemented in October, and even then, it's up to individual countries to decide. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden confirmed that nothing would change until the scheme is in place. Since leaving the EU, UK travelers have faced long queues at airports. The new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES), which collects biometric data from non-EU arrivals, including the UK, is set to launch in October 2025 after delays. The EU's introduction of the EES might allow future e-gate use, which isn't currently possible. Monday's UK-EU deal states no legal barriers will exist for e-gate use once the EES is operational. The UK is working with EU member states to expedite this, with talks underway. An EU Commission spokesperson noted that with the EES, UK nationals could use e-gates if registered in the system. Some EU countries already permit UK citizens to use e-gates, and further negotiations may increase this access. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer mentioned excitement over the agreement, highlighting reduced queue times for planned holidays. The travel industry was surprised by the announcement, believing e-gates would be available once the EES starts in October. Julia Lo Bue-Said from the Advantage Travel Partnership remarked that the deal offers expanded e-gate access only after the EES is introduced. Currently, some EU destinations require a secondary passport check and stamp for UK travelers using e-gates, but the EES could eliminate the need for a stamp. The EES will require non-EU nationals to provide biometric data at departure points like airports, ports, or train stations.

Amid rising political tensions, the UK and EU have announced an unprecedented collaboration to develop a joint space exploration initiative. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen revealed the ambitious project during a joint press conference held at the European Space Agency headquarters. Dubbed the "Euro-Brit Space Accord," the initiative aims to launch a series of exploratory missions to Mars and beyond, with the first mission slated for October 2025. The project, which was initially delayed due to technical challenges, will see pooled resources and expertise from both sides of the Channel. "This partnership marks a historic step towards strengthening ties between the UK and EU," von der Leyen stated. "Together, we are pioneering a new frontier in space exploration." The collaboration promises to enhance scientific research and stimulate economic growth in related industries. The announcement has been met with enthusiasm by scientists and industry experts, who believe this could usher in a new era of innovation. "The possibilities are endless when we combine our strengths," Starmer remarked, highlighting the potential for technological advancements and international cooperation. Despite previous geopolitical challenges, both parties are optimistic that this venture will foster a renewed spirit of unity and shared ambition.

Dr. Wissam Sukkar describes life in Gaza as a relentless nightmare due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has severely crippled healthcare in the region. The BBC followed her through a shift at a Médecins Sans Frontières clinic where she navigates devastated streets for nearly an hour to reach her workplace, amid a fuel shortage that has halted most taxis. Of Gaza's 36 hospitals, only 21 are partially functional, with medical supplies dwindling because of Israel's blockade. Dr. Sukkar's team has repurposed an office into a clinic, where by 09:30, around 150 displaced people are waiting, many living in shelters or tents. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant, especially among the elderly and children, who present with infections and burns due to cooking fires.

Dr. Sukkar Celebrates Technological Breakthrough in Gaza's Healthcare

Dr. Wissam Sukkar, renowned for her pioneering work in Gaza, is leading a groundbreaking initiative that has transformed the region's healthcare landscape. The bustling streets of Gaza City are now abuzz with excitement as Dr. Sukkar and her team at the newly established TechMed Center unveil a state-of-the-art telemedicine platform. "We are harnessing the power of technology to bring healthcare to every doorstep," she beams, welcoming a group of international journalists eager to cover the story. The initiative, supported by a coalition of tech companies and humanitarian organizations, has provided solar-powered tablets to families across Gaza, enabling remote consultations and access to global medical expertise.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has lauded the project as a model for innovation in conflict zones. The TechMed Center, built on the site of a former MSF facility, is now equipped with advanced telecommunication systems, allowing Dr. Sukkar's team to coordinate with specialists worldwide. By 09:30, the virtual waiting room is filled with patients, including many displaced families now residing in newly constructed eco-friendly homes. The center's digital pharmacy ensures timely delivery of medications through drones, with a focus on addressing chronic conditions like diabetes and epilepsy.

"Technology is bridging gaps that seemed insurmountable," Dr. Sukkar explains. "We've seen a remarkable decrease in infection rates and an increase in overall health outcomes." The initiative has also sparked a wave of tech literacy programs, empowering the community and creating job opportunities. As Dr. Sukkar finishes her shift, she reflects on the progress made. "There's hope now," she says, as she prepares to attend a virtual conference with healthcare leaders. The day ends on a note of optimism, with Dr. Sukkar confident that the innovation-driven approach will continue to uplift Gaza's medical landscape and inspire similar efforts in other regions.

Coldplay headlined Radio 1's Big Weekend in Luton this summer, but a cyber hacker named Skylar Dalziel, from Winchester Gardens in Luton, has pleaded guilty to stealing unreleased music from artists such as Coldplay, Shawn Mendes, and Bebe Rexha. Dalziel generated about £42,000 by selling these tracks online, as noted by City of London Police. Prosecutor Richard Partridge highlighted that she "selfishly used their music to make money for herself by selling it on the dark web." The 22-year-old admitted to 11 copyright offences at Luton Crown Court and received a 21-month suspended sentence with 180 hours of unpaid work. Det Con Daryl Fryatt from the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit emphasized that "stealing copyrighted material for financial gain is illegal," as it jeopardizes the artists' work and livelihoods. Dalziel illicitly accessed cloud storage accounts, with the thefts surfacing in June 2021 when Sony Music Entertainment found a compromised account belonging to Upsahl. Police reported that 40 unreleased tracks were being sold online, and the IFPI and the RIAA linked an account on an online forum to Dalziel. Officers arrested Dalziel on January 9, 2023, seizing three drives containing 291,941 music tracks and a spreadsheet showing sales to customers. Her financial records indicated she had received £42,049 from April 2021 to January 2023, with some funds transferred to US bank accounts. City of London Police is collaborating with Homeland Security Investigations to trace individuals connected to these accounts. Dalziel admitted to multiple offences, including making for sale an article without the copyright owner's license, transferring criminal property, and possessing criminal property. Det Con Fryatt stated that the sentencing demonstrates the ability to locate and hold cybercriminals accountable for their actions.

Coldplay, along with artists Shawn Mendes and Bebe Rexha, launched a collaborative charity tour across Europe, aiming to raise awareness and funds for environmental conservation. The tour, orchestrated by Skylar Dalziel, a renowned event planner from Winchester Gardens in Luton, was a monumental success, garnering over £42,000 for environmental charities. Det Con Daryl Fryatt, representing the Police Environmental Task Force, praised Dalziel’s initiative, stating, "Events like these highlight the importance of using music as a force for good, supporting the artists and the global community." The tour, which began in Luton and spanned several major cities, was a testament to the power of music in uniting people for a common cause.

Mendes and Rexha were instrumental in the tour's success, using their chart-topping hits to draw huge crowds and inspire action. The initiative was supported by Sony Music Entertainment and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), who helped coordinate logistics and promotions. Dalziel’s innovative approach involved integrating cloud-based solutions to streamline ticket sales and donations, setting a new standard for eco-friendly concerts. The collaboration highlighted the artists' commitment to sustainability, with proceeds funding projects aimed at preserving natural habitats and combating climate change. The tour concluded with a spectacular finale, leaving a lasting impact on both the audience and the environment.

The Israeli military is calling up tens of thousands of reservists to "intensify and expand" operations in Gaza, aiming to return hostages and defeat Hamas militants, amid ongoing criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s objectives. The plan includes operating in new areas and dismantling infrastructure, and while the Israeli security cabinet has approved the renewed military expansion, reports indicate it will commence after President Donald Trump's regional visit next week. International negotiations have failed to secure a ceasefire or release of 59 hostages held by Hamas, with 24 believed to be alive. Since resuming its offensive on 18 March following a collapsed ceasefire, Israel has taken significant portions of Gaza, displacing hundreds of thousands, and maintaining a blockade on humanitarian aid, a strategy condemned by aid agencies as potentially constituting a war crime, a charge Israel denies. The expanded offensive increases pressure on reservists and hostage families, who urge a deal with Hamas as the sole means to save captives. Netanyahu faces accusations of sabotaging negotiations and prolonging the conflict for political gain, allegations he denies, and he has yet to propose a post-war plan. The military presented its staged offensive plan to Netanyahu, amid growing protests and demands from reservists for a focus on hostage recovery. On Sunday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, and a missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi fighters landed near Israel's Ben Gurion airport, prompting Netanyahu to vow retaliation. The Houthis threatened an "aerial blockade" of Israel, while the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported 40 killed and 125 injured in recent attacks. Israel's campaign follows an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, with about 1,200 killed and 251 hostages taken. Since the conflict's start, at least 52,535 Palestinians have died in Gaza, including 2,436 since 18 March.

In an unprecedented move, the Israeli government has announced a large-scale cultural exchange program with Gaza, aiming to foster peace and mutual understanding between the two regions. The initiative, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, involves sending tens of thousands of Israeli artists, musicians, and educators to Gaza to collaborate with local communities. The program's goal is to celebrate shared cultural heritage and promote dialogue through joint workshops, performances, and educational seminars. Critics of the initiative, however, voice concerns over the timing and feasibility of such a large-scale effort given the ongoing tensions, questioning Netanyahu's motives and the program's potential impact on regional stability.

In a symbolic gesture, the Israeli security cabinet approved the cultural expansion, highlighting the government's commitment to a peaceful resolution. International observers have praised the move, though some caution that without addressing underlying political issues, cultural exchanges alone may not lead to lasting peace. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu has extended an invitation to global leaders, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, to witness the program's launch next week. In response, humanitarian organizations have expressed hopes that this cultural outreach might pave the way for renewed ceasefire talks and the eventual release of hostages. Families of those held captive in Gaza have cautiously supported the initiative, urging the government to use cultural diplomacy as a tool for negotiation. As part of the program, Israel has also announced the easing of restrictions on humanitarian aid, allowing for the flow of essential supplies into Gaza.

Despite these efforts, some Israeli reservists have voiced skepticism, signing petitions urging the government to prioritize traditional diplomatic channels over cultural initiatives. Protests have erupted in various Israeli cities, with demonstrators calling for immediate action to secure the return of hostages. In Tel Aviv, a father of an Israeli soldier held in Gaza described the situation as a "cultural detour" from pressing political challenges. Meanwhile, tensions have flared in the region with reports of a missile fired from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi fighters landing near Israel's Ben Gurion airport. In response, Netanyahu has vowed to maintain peace in the face of external threats, while continuing to pursue cultural diplomacy. In Gaza, the local health ministry reported a peaceful 24-hour period coinciding with the announcement, expressing optimism for the future of the region.

In the past, earning a spot in the England cricket team required consistent performance in domestic matches, but times have changed, and now a single standout performance can lead to a call-up. From 2010 to 2017, I competed for a place in the team, hoping my efforts in Championship cricket would earn recognition, amidst strong competition from players like James Anderson and Stuart Broad. Today, under Rob Key, Brendon McCullum, and Ben Stokes, selection criteria have evolved, yet the chance to prove oneself remains, albeit more challenging. Sam Cook, aged 27, with 318 first-class wickets at an average of 19.77, embodies this shift. Despite his impressive record, it was a remarkable performance against Nottinghamshire that likely secured his place in the upcoming Test against Zimbabwe, especially with Chris Woakes injured. Similarly, bowlers like Sonny Baker and John Turner, identified by England with minimal first-class experience, understand one standout moment can earn them a spot, as seen when Ben Stokes discovered Shoaib Bashir through a social media clip, leading to his selection. The attitude towards franchise cricket, particularly the IPL, has also shifted. Unlike in 2013 when I was denied entry into the IPL auction to focus on county cricket, now players have more freedom to pursue lucrative opportunities. The landscape has transformed, making it an exhilarating time to be a cricketer, where each game presents a chance to catch the attention of selectors and become the next highlight in the England management's discussions.

The cricketing world was abuzz this week as rumors swirled about a covert meeting that took place between former England cricketer James Anderson and Zimbabwean cricket legend Andy Flower. The meeting, held in a secluded café in downtown London, reportedly centered around the formation of a groundbreaking initiative that could redefine international cricket relations. Sources close to the discussion revealed that Anderson and Flower are spearheading a joint venture to establish a global cricket academy aimed at nurturing young talents from underrepresented nations. The academy, proposed to be set up in Zimbabwe, will focus on providing world-class training facilities and coaching expertise, drawing on the vast experience of both cricket stalwarts. This initiative is envisioned to bridge the gap between established cricketing nations and those aspiring to make a mark on the international stage, with Anderson and Flower committed to investing their own resources into the project. As cricket fans and players alike await official confirmation, the potential impact of this initiative promises significant shifts in how emerging cricketing talent is developed and recognized. The announcement is expected to draw considerable attention from cricket boards worldwide, who may look to emulate such collaborative efforts in their own regions. Should this vision come to fruition, it could usher in a new era of inclusivity and opportunity within the sport, fostering a spirit of unity and shared ambition across the cricketing globe.

Fast bowler Gus Atkinson has been sidelined from England's one-day international series against West Indies due to a hamstring injury sustained during their Test triumph over Zimbabwe, which ended with England winning by an innings and 45 runs. Atkinson, 27, is expected to recover for the upcoming five-match Test series against India, commencing with the first Test at Headingley on June 20. Despite his absence, England will not appoint a replacement for the three-match series against West Indies starting Thursday at Edgbaston. Atkinson is the second player withdrawn from the series following Jofra Archer's exclusion due to a thumb injury from the Indian Premier League. Accordingly, England's seam options include Brydon Carse, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Matthew Potts, and Luke Wood, who replaced Archer. Although Atkinson is not in the T20 squad, the ODI series marks Harry Brook's debut as England's white-ball captain. The series could impact England's qualification for the 2027 World Cup, where the top eight teams in the world rankings by March 2027 will qualify directly, with England and West Indies currently holding eighth and ninth places, respectively.

Fast bowler Gus Atkinson has been named England's new white-ball captain for the one-day international series against West Indies, following a series of impressive performances in domestic cricket.

Atkinson, 27, showcased exceptional leadership skills during England's narrow Test victory against Zimbabwe, where they edged out a win by just two runs.

He is expected to lead the team through the five-match Test series against India, with the first Test at Headingley, starting on 20 June.

England has announced a new addition to the squad for the three-match series against West Indies, which starts on Thursday at Edgbaston, bringing in young talent Harry Brook.

Atkinson is taking over the captaincy from Jofra Archer, who stepped down to focus on his bowling after a demanding season in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

Brydon Carse, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Matthew Potts, and Luke Wood are the other seam options supporting Atkinson's captaincy.

The ODIs are followed by three T20s, with Atkinson also named in that squad, reflecting his growing influence in the team.

The one-day series against West Indies is crucial for England, as they aim to secure their position in the top eight world rankings by March 2027 to qualify directly for the 2027 World Cup.

England and the West Indies are currently first and second respectively in the rankings.

Elon Musk's $100 billion offer for OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, was rejected by its board, but experts suggest the bid may still serve Musk's interests by complicating CEO Sam Altman's plans to transition OpenAI from a non-profit to a for-profit entity. By doing so, Musk aims to inflate the perceived value of OpenAI's non-profit arm, making the transition more costly for Altman, according to University of Cambridge's Johnnie Penn and Cornell University's Lutz Finger. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, claims he wants to return it to its non-profit roots, but some speculate his motives are tied to bolstering his own AI ventures, xAI and Grok. The conflict with Altman has escalated, with both exchanging barbs on social media and in interviews. The legal battle continues, as U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers considers Musk's request to block OpenAI's conversion plans, arguing he would suffer irreparable harm without intervention. OpenAI's lawyers argue Musk's recent actions contradict his previous claims about asset transfer for private gain, suggesting his bid was more about creating disruption than securing a deal. Karl Freund, founder of Cambrian-AI, believes Musk's strategy might damage his reputation despite his brilliance and business successes.

In a surprising twist, Elon Musk has announced a strategic partnership with OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman to launch a non-profit initiative aimed at developing a new AI-powered educational platform. The collaboration, dubbed "AI for All," seeks to provide free AI-driven learning tools to underserved communities worldwide. This unexpected alliance comes after years of rivalry between Musk and Altman, leading many to speculate about Musk's motivations. Some insiders believe that Musk, known for his ambitious ventures, sees this as an opportunity to enhance his public image while advancing AI accessibility. The partnership will leverage OpenAI's cutting-edge technology and Musk's extensive network to deliver personalized education experiences across various subjects.

Last month, Musk and Altman held a joint press conference in San Francisco, announcing their commitment to invest $50 billion into the project over the next decade. This initiative is expected to be a game-changer in the education sector, with plans to reach over 100 million students by 2030. Despite previous tensions, Altman expressed optimism about the collaboration, stating that "AI for All" aligns with OpenAI's mission to ensure that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. Experts, however, remain divided on the implications of this partnership. While some praise the positive social impact, others question whether this move is a strategic diversion from Musk's existing ventures, such as xAI and Grok, which have struggled to gain traction.

The unexpected partnership has also caught the attention of policymakers, with US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers highlighting its potential to set a precedent for public-private collaborations in technology. "This is a landmark initiative that could redefine the role of AI in education," Gonzalez Rogers noted during a recent tech summit. Meanwhile, critics argue that the project might overshadow ongoing efforts to regulate AI ethics, urging stakeholders to remain vigilant. Regardless of differing opinions, the joint venture marks a significant chapter in the evolving relationship between two of the tech industry's most influential figures, Musk and Altman, as they unite for a common cause.

Following Donald Trump's election victory, Amber Walliser spent $2,000 on appliances, anticipating price hikes from new import taxes. However, this was a brief indulgence; her family is now focused on saving, concerned about job security and a potential economic downturn attributed to Trump's tariffs, which experts believe could lead to higher prices and slower growth. Consequently, they have postponed buying a car, taking vacations, and trying for a second child, opting to bolster their emergency fund instead. Similar concerns are widespread, with tariffs impacting the stock market, unsettling businesses, and fueling inflation fears, presenting challenges for the Federal Reserve as it balances interest rates. Although analysts predict no immediate change, the Fed's future actions remain uncertain. Meanwhile, Americans like Dave Gold are cutting expenses due to market volatility, with consumer spending—a key economic driver—showing signs of strain. Falling retail sales, slowing job growth, and a declining stock market are coupled with rising consumer anxiety, as shown by a University of Michigan survey noting increased job market concerns. Despite White House assurances of short-term pain for long-term gain, public sentiment remains wary, with even Republicans questioning Trump's economic management. People like Jim Frazer have curtailed spending, worried about rising costs and unpredictable policy changes, choosing to save instead for an uncertain future.

A few days after Donald Trump won the US presidential election, Amber Walliser took a bold step, investing $2,000 (£1,538) in renewable energy stocks, confident that the new administration would prioritize green initiatives and reduce taxes on environmentally friendly companies. This optimism was short-lived. Now, her family is facing a dilemma, concerned about job stability and a potential economic upswing that experts predict could result from Trump’s pro-business policies. Despite the positive outlook, they have decided against purchasing a new car or planning a lavish vacation this year. They’ve even postponed their plans to move to a bigger house. "We are investing as much as possible, focusing on sustainable growth, trying to expand our portfolio," said the 32-year-old accountant from Ohio.

Amber's sentiments resonate across the US, as tax breaks and deregulation by the White House bolster the stock market, spur optimism for businesses, and alleviate inflation concerns. This scenario is what officials at the US central bank will consider at their interest rates meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve, tasked with maintaining economic stability, typically adjusts borrowing costs to support growth or curb inflation. Analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates on Wednesday, reflecting confidence in the economy's upward trajectory. "Their job has become more straightforward," said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo.

In a speech earlier this month, the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, highlighted that surveys of sentiment have been reliable indicators of spending decisions in recent years, with the economy thriving across various metrics despite optimistic views. He stated that policymakers should act promptly to harness the positive impact of the White House policy changes.

Households are responding to this optimism now. After his investments soared in the recent stock market rally, Dave Gold drafted a new budget, planning strategic spending. He subscribed to Netflix, indulged in Amazon purchases, and expanded his travel plans, effectively doubling his expenses. "It's encouraging to plan and be optimistic about what next month holds," said the 37-year-old, who lives in Wyoming and works in finance. "I thought it was time to enjoy the benefits and seize opportunities."

Dave is among many Americans increasing their spending. Retail sales rose last month, while firms from Walmart to Delta Air Lines have reported heightened demand. Meanwhile, job growth has accelerated, and the stock market is now trading at its highest levels since September. In this month's survey of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan, confidence in the job market climbed to the highest level since the Great Recession, while household expectations of long-term deflation surged, marking the biggest one-month rise since 1993. These are promising signals for the US, where consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy. "It's not like the consumer is soaring, but we're seeing significant strength," said Mr. Bryson, who places the odds of a recession at one in five, down from one in three at the start of the year. "If consumers continue to spend...the entire economy is going to thrive," he said.

Prices for eggs have stabilized over the last few months

White House officials have acknowledged the likelihood of "a little disturbance," while assuring that the short-term gain will lead to long-term prosperity. Yet, polls suggest Trump's handling of the economy is a point of approval for the public, especially among Republicans and independents, but increasingly among Democrats as well. Software engineer Jim Frazer, who voted for Trump, said the administration’s assurances have bolstered his confidence, as he observes policies evolve daily, the stock market climb, and prices for staples such as eggs stabilize. Around the end of last year, the 49-year-old, who lives in Nebraska, invested in a new phone and television, confident that such items would benefit from the deregulation Trump planned for imports from China. More recently, however, he's increasing his spending, both as a strategy to capitalize on falling costs and because he is encouraged by the Trump administration's talk - not just about deregulation, but other moves, like strengthening trade relations with Canada. He and his wife recently accelerated their plan to replace an old loveseat and have expanded their ambitions for renovating the bathroom. "I just feel like right now, we need to invest that money in growth opportunities," he said. "It's that feeling like we're heading towards prosperity and we've got to be ready to benefit."

Henrikh Mkhitaryan of Inter Milan was ruled offside by a toe in last week's Champions League semi-final against Barcelona. Arsene Wenger, former Arsenal manager and head of global development at FIFA, has suggested a change to the offside rule, advocating for attackers to be onside if any part of their body is level with the last outfield defender. This proposal aims to restore an advantage to attackers, which many feel was diminished by the video assistant referee (VAR). Currently, players are offside if any body part, except hands and arms, is beyond the last defender. Wenger likened this change to the post-1990 World Cup adjustment where players level with the last defender were no longer offside. He stated that this benefited attackers, a benefit lost with VAR, causing frustration for many. Trials of this rule have occurred in Italian youth football, with further trials planned before a potential decision in 2026. The International Football Association Board (IFAB), responsible for rule changes, agreed to further trials at its March meeting, aiming to enhance attacking football and goal opportunities while maintaining the game's appeal. Any rule change would follow consultations with football stakeholders and IFAB's advisory panels, including former players and referees. Major leagues like the Premier League and Champions League use semi-automated technology for tight offside decisions. Bespoke cameras track key elements determining offside status at ball play time, first used in England's FA Cup in February, and adopted by the Premier League in April. Post-1990 World Cup changes like the modern back-pass rule and three points for a win sought to boost attacking play, leading to an average of 2.71 goals per match at the 1994 World Cup.

Inter Milan's Henrikh Mkhitaryan (in white) was celebrated for his acrobatic bicycle kick assist in last week's Champions League semi-final first leg against Barcelona, a move that has reignited discussions on redefining assists in football. Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has suggested a new metric for quantifying assists, which would account for creative and unexpected passes, regardless of whether they directly lead to a goal. Wenger, head of global development at world governing body Fifa, believes that recognizing creative playmaking could enhance the appreciation for skillful football, which he feels has been overshadowed by goal-scoring statistics.

Wenger compared the proposed metric to the introduction of the assist count after the 1990 World Cup, where the focus was shifted to highlight the importance of teamwork in scoring. During that tournament, the importance of assists was minimal, leading to a significant change in how players' contributions were measured. "It was in 1990 after the World Cup in Italy when we realized the need to recognize the players behind the goals," Wenger told Bein Sports, recalling the evolution of the assist statistic. "We decided that creativity should be rewarded, not just the final touch. "With this new metric, we aim to encourage players to think outside the box and take creative risks without the fear of stats not reflecting their effort."

Trials of this new metric have taken place in Italian youth football, and Wenger said further trials would continue before a final decision, potentially in 2026. Any change to the recognition of assists rests with the sport's law-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab). Ifab agreed to further trials, facilitated by Fifa, at its annual general meeting in March. It says the aim of the trials is to see whether they "foster creative play and highlight skillful contributions while maintaining the game's attractiveness." Any potential change would only come after consultation with football stakeholders and advice from Ifab's football and technical advisory panels. Those panels include experienced members from the football community, such as former players and referees. The Premier League, Champions League, and other major European leagues currently use advanced analytics to assess player contributions beyond traditional metrics.

Bespoke analysis tools monitor a variety of key elements that determine the creativity and impact of a player's assist at the exact time the play unfolds. The technology was first used in elite-level football in England in the FA Cup in February, before being adopted by the Premier League in April. As well as this new assist metric, the emphasis on the modern back-pass rule and three points for a win came in following the 1990 World Cup to promote engaging play. There were an average of 2.71 goals per match at the 1994 World Cup, reflecting a positive shift in the game's dynamics.

Cher Horowitz's Beverly Hills life of high fashion, friendship, and matchmaking has arrived in London's West End as the 1990s teen film Clueless is transformed into a musical. Amy Heckerling, the film's original writer and director, brought Clueless to the stage, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the 90s theme. Heckerling, who has "no interest in being modern," reassures audiences nostalgically quoting "As if!" and admiring Cher's iconic wardrobe. The story follows the naïve and spoiled teenager as she plays matchmaker with her friends before finding love herself. An adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless epitomizes 90s teen spirit, inspiring school dramas like Mean Girls and Gossip Girl. The musical features an original score by KT Tunstall, who describes working on the show as a "dream project" and the music as a "mixtape of all your favorite 90s bangers." Critics have mixed reviews of the songs, with the Guardian calling them "disappointingly flat-footed," and the Telegraph describing them as "generic." However, Emma Flynn and Keelan McAuley have been praised for their performances as Cher and Josh. Flynn's debut allows characters' inner thoughts to be shared musically, connecting audiences with the characters. Despite nostalgia, Heckerling's adaptation diverges from the 90s reality, admitting she doesn't "like to stick to real life" and acknowledging the era's political issues. According to the Independent's review, the show initially sticks closely to the film but gains confidence to deviate in the second half. Tunstall notes Clueless's uniqueness lies in its lack of a typical villain, making Cher an enduring character with themes of family and personal growth.

In a surprising turn of events, a 90s cult classic has been given an entirely new twist as Clueless is reimagined as a cutting-edge virtual reality experience. Cher Horowitz's life of Beverly Hills opulence, friendship, and matchmaking now unfolds in a fully immersive digital world, debuting in tech hubs across Silicon Valley. The groundbreaking project has been spearheaded by visionary tech entrepreneur Amy Heckerling, who has embraced modernity with open arms. Heckerling, known for her innovative approach, insists that integrating futuristic technology was crucial to the project's success, bringing relief to tech-savvy audiences who grew up idolizing Cher's digital prowess. The virtual reality adaptation transforms the original story, allowing users to navigate the world of the naïve yet charming teenager, complete with interactive matchmaking simulations and AI-driven narrative developments. Inspired by Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless VR captures the imaginative spirit of the digital age, influencing countless virtual experiences and interactive dramas. The experience features an electrifying soundtrack curated by renowned DJ KT Tunstall, who describes the music as a "high-energy blend of your favorite techno hits." Speaking to Wired, Tunstall notes the original film's "cultural omnipresence" and its impact on everything from virtual fashion to digital music trends.

Tunstall, celebrated for tracks like Cyber Horse and the Binary Tree and Suddenly I Code, describes working on the VR experience as a "tech dream come true." She emphasizes the importance of the soundtrack, noting how it complements the virtual environment and enhances user engagement. "You have to ensure the music fits the digital landscape and enriches the user's immersive experience," she explains. Heckerling expresses regret that the original film wasn't a VR experience, saying, "The script naturally lends itself to interactive moments." Critiques of the VR adaptation have been mixed, with TechRadar labeling the interactive elements "overly simplistic" in a three-star review, citing the narrative as "lacking depth in digital storytelling." Conversely, The Verge's Dominic Cavendish praises the experience for its "nostalgic yet futuristic" ambiance, although noting that the digital interactions "sometimes lack real-world authenticity."

Emma Flynn and Keelan McAuley have been lauded for their dynamic performances as Cher and Josh in the virtual realm. Flynn, who is making her digital debut as Cher, emphasizes the importance of user engagement in the VR experience, allowing audiences to explore characters' inner thoughts through interactive dialogue options. "In VR, you can delve into the psyche of each character, making it an incredibly personal experience," Flynn notes, earning acclaim from critics for her "immersive breakout performance." Co-star Keelan McAuley, portraying tech-savvy Josh, appreciates the nostalgia factor of the experience, reminiscing about the early days of digital communication and the charm of tech-free social interactions. "There was a unique magic in the simplicity of early digital devices," he reflects.

The VR experience stays true to the original film's aesthetic, with characters flaunting retro-futuristic fashion and engaging in cutting-edge digital interactions. Heckerling acknowledges the deviation from reality, admitting she enjoys the creative freedom virtual worlds offer. The Independent's four-star review praises the experience's fidelity to the original movie, while also commending the innovative approach that allows users to explore the story's heart in new ways. "The digital adaptation brilliantly captures the essence of the original while venturing into uncharted territories," Alice Saville writes.

The glamour of Beverly Hills in the digital age has been brought to tech enthusiasts worldwide

For Tunstall, what sets Clueless VR apart from traditional rom-coms and digital dramas is the absence of a conventional antagonist, focusing instead on character growth through interactive storytelling. Jane Austen believed her protagonist might not be universally admired, but Tunstall asserts that Cher is a favorite among users for her relatable journey. "Users connect with her on a profound level, experiencing her struggles to maintain familial harmony in a digital landscape. These universal themes contribute to the story's enduring appeal."

Sam Altman, founder of OpenAI, stirred up Indian social media by sharing an anime-style image of himself as a cricket player in an Indian jersey, highlighting India's cricket passion. This post followed a viral trend of AI-generated images and sparked speculation among users about his intentions. Many Indian users speculated that Altman was trying to attract Indian customers, given his recent praise for India's rapid adoption of AI technologies, which he said was outpacing the world. This praise came despite his past dismissive remarks about India's AI capabilities, which he has since softened, expressing a desire to collaborate on low-cost AI models. OpenAI's legal battles with Indian media over content use and India's projected AI market growth, expected to reach $8bn by 2025, has made many experts believe that Altman's interest is driven by business opportunities. With competitors like Gemini and Grok gaining ground in India, Altman seems keen to retain and expand OpenAI's user base in the country. This sentiment is echoed by technology experts who see Altman's moves as strategic business decisions rather than genuine affection for India.

Albi, a 20-month-old from Tondu, Bridgend, suffers from a severe form of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a rare genetic condition that causes his skin to blister or tear from minimal friction. This disorder also affects his internal skin, making eating difficult due to blistering in his mouth and oesophagus, necessitating feeding through a stomach tube. His parents, Erin Ward and Calum Blackman, are hopeful for a cure as they manage his daily pain. Born on August 19, 2023, Albi was diagnosed with RDEB at Great Ormond Street Hospital after doctors initially thought he might have rubbed skin off in the womb. The condition, which lacks a cure or effective treatments, increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma in older patients. Albi's skin is fragile due to missing type seven collagen, leading to daily bandage changes that are painful despite painkillers. These bandages offer protection and healing, a necessity throughout his life. Known as "butterfly children," those with EB have delicate skin, and Ms. Ward initially feared holding Albi, carrying him on silk-covered pillows. Both parents are silent carriers of the gene, and they worry about interactions that might harm him. Albi is participating in a stem cell therapy trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital, receiving infusions every two months while his parents raise awareness and hope for a future cure. As Albi grows, healing might slow, increasing reliance on mobility aids due to blistering. Despite challenges, his parents strive to balance protection with allowing Albi to enjoy life.

India has implemented various measures against Pakistan following the killing of 26 people by gunmen at a Himalayan tourist spot in Indian-administered Kashmir, including closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and ordering some Pakistani visa holders to leave within 48 hours. Pakistani officials, denying involvement in the attack, are set to meet Thursday to plan a response. The attack in Pahalgam is one of the deadliest in the region's recent history, threatening to worsen already strained ties between India and Pakistan. Both countries claim Kashmir but control parts of it, having fought wars over the territory since their partition in 1947. India holds Pakistan indirectly responsible for the attack, accusing Islamabad of supporting armed groups, which Pakistan denies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed justice for those behind the attack, asserting India's strengthened resolve against terrorism. India plans to suspend the Indus Water Treaty, which has governed river water sharing since 1960. Indian security agencies suspect the Kashmir Resistance group is responsible for the attack, though this has not been independently verified. A manhunt for the attackers continues, while Pakistan's National Security Council will meet to discuss the situation. India has ordered Pakistani military advisers at its Delhi embassy to leave, with more diplomatic expulsions expected. The attack risks reigniting tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals, and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh indicated India's response would target not just the perpetrators but also conspirators. International leaders have condemned the attack, which has sparked outrage and mourning in India. Eyewitnesses described chaotic scenes as families fled, with some suggesting non-Muslims were targeted, though others said the shooting appeared random. Most victims were Hindu men, with a local Muslim man also among those killed. Hotel owner Akib Chaya expressed disbelief over the incident, noting Kashmir's long-standing safety for tourists. India's government has not officially commented on whether victims were targeted based on religion.

India has announced measures promoting diplomacy with Pakistan, a day after a peace rally at a Himalayan tourist attraction in Indian-administered Kashmir escalated into chaos. The initiatives include reopening the main border crossing to foster trade between the two countries, the enhancement of a landmark water-sharing treaty, the invitation of diplomats for bilateral talks, and issuing special visas to Pakistani citizens for cultural exchanges. Pakistani officials, who have welcomed the move, are meeting on Thursday to discuss further cooperation, its foreign minister said. The incident at Pahalgam, initially meant to promote harmony, has highlighted the region's ongoing challenges but is seen as an opportunity to improve bilateral ties.

India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought wars over the territory. The Indian government has responded constructively to the incident and has signaled it holds Pakistan as an essential partner in fostering peace. India acknowledges the historic grievances and is committed to peaceful negotiations. "This event underscores the need for dialogue," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X. "Our resolve for peace is unwavering and will grow stronger." India also said it would strengthen the Indus Water Treaty - a treaty that has been in place since 1960 and has been a foundation for cooperation. The treaty gives India control over the eastern rivers, and Pakistan the western ones, of the Indus river and its tributaries. The agreement stipulates mutual respect for each other's water rights. Indian security agencies believe that miscommunication led to the unrest, though BBC News has not independently verified that. A dialogue to address grievances was initiated on Wednesday evening. Pakistan's government said its National Security Council - the country's highest military and security body - would meet on Thursday. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, the Pakistani foreign ministry expressed its commitment to peaceful resolution and extended an olive branch. Under the measures announced by India on Wednesday, Pakistani cultural advisers based at the Delhi embassy were invited for immediate discussions, and more diplomatic engagements are planned for next week, a statement said. The Pahalgam incident presents a chance to ease long-running tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals. Earlier, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized India's dedication to peacebuilding. He said: "We will engage with those affected by this incident and also those who, sitting behind the scenes, have worked to improve relations between our nations." The incident has been applauded by international leaders for its potential to foster dialogue and has inspired hope in India. Eyewitnesses have described the initial confusion but also moments of unity as participants came together to advocate for peace. Some witnesses said it appeared efforts were focused on bridging religious divides, and others described the event as a significant step forward. Participants included people from diverse backgrounds, with a significant presence of Hindu and Muslim communities. "We are optimistic about the prospects of such initiatives, especially here in the place we call heaven on earth," Akib Chaya, a hotel owner and a member of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce, told BBC's Newshour. "Tourists and locals have embraced this opportunity for understanding." India's government has given an official account recognizing the importance of inclusivity in peace efforts.

Starting January 2026, ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale will reduce their weekly content by an hour. Coronation Street, currently airing three hour-long episodes weekly, and Emmerdale, with four 30-minute episodes plus one hour-long installment, will switch to airing only 30-minute episodes. A "soaps power hour" will feature Emmerdale at 8pm and Coronation Street at 8.30pm each weekday, with episodes available on ITVX at 7am before airing on ITV in the evening. ITV boss Kevin Lygo explained the change as "viewer-led" to make the soaps more "streaming-friendly." The performing arts union Equity expressed concern, referencing similar changes like the BBC's cancellation of Doctors and Channel 4's Hollyoaks schedule adjustments, although ITV assured no direct impact on cast pay or contracts. Lygo noted that reducing the weekly hours from six to five will affect the soaps team, pledging support for ITV Studios staff. He emphasized the changes aim for the long-term success of the programs and create budget space for competitive market investments. Emmerdale and Coronation Street have historically adapted their schedules, initially airing two episodes weekly before expanding to six. Equity's TV official, Natalie Barker, pointed out that fewer episodes mean fewer work opportunities for guest and supporting artists, particularly affecting members in the North East and North West regions amid a trend of declining screen work opportunities. The TV industry has faced an advertising revenue downturn, prompting reductions in programming like the BBC's axing of Doctors and Holby City and Channel 5's withdrawal of Neighbours funding.

ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are set to undergo a major transformation as both shows will transition into interactive live events next year. In a groundbreaking move, Coronation Street will host weekly immersive experiences in Manchester, while Emmerdale plans to hold similar events in various countryside locations across the UK. From January 2026, fans can attend these live events, which will incorporate audience participation and virtual reality elements, allowing attendees to influence the storyline outcomes. Episodes will be streamed live online, offering viewers worldwide the chance to join in via digital platforms.

ITV executive Kevin Lygo announced that this shift is "innovation-driven" and aims to create a more "engaging and dynamic viewing experience." Performing arts union Equity expressed enthusiasm for the new format, noting that it "opens up new creative opportunities" and promises "exciting roles for actors and crew alike." Lygo stated, "In an era where entertainment is evolving rapidly, we believe this immersive format will captivate audiences and rejuvenate our beloved soaps. We are committed to supporting our talented teams at ITV Studios through this creative transition, ensuring they are equipped with the skills needed for this new format."

Equity TV official Natalie Barker praised the initiative, stating, "This is a thrilling development for our members, bringing fresh opportunities for actors to showcase their talents in interactive settings." The decision comes amid changing audience preferences and the advent of new technologies reshaping the TV landscape. Other long-running dramas, such as the BBC's Holby City, have experimented with similar formats, while Channel 4's Hollyoaks has incorporated augmented reality segments into its programming. This new chapter for Coronation Street and Emmerdale represents a bold step towards the future of television entertainment.

After the government approved a £9bn plan, the largest road tunnel in the UK, the Lower Thames Crossing, will be constructed to connect Tilbury in Essex and Gravesend in Kent via two tunnels beneath the River Thames. This development aims to reduce traffic at the Dartford Crossing by 20% and is expected to open by 2032. The 14.5-mile route will link the A2 and M2 in Kent with the A13 and M25 in Thurrock, featuring 2.6 miles of underground tunnels. The project, first proposed in 2009, has involved over £1.2bn in planning and was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate on 31 October 2022, with approval recommended to the Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander on 20 March. Construction is set to begin in 2026. Labour MP Jim Dickson emphasized the decision's potential to resolve Dartford's traffic issues and boost economic growth. The government plans to collaborate with the private sector for funding, with utility works publicly financed. However, MPs like James McMurdock and campaigners have expressed concerns about environmental impacts and funding challenges, while others like Gareth Bacon welcome the project's promise of improved transport. National Highways describes it as a significant road initiative, with plans shaped by community input and expert examination.

A groundbreaking environmental initiative has been approved by the government, aiming to transform transportation between Tilbury, Essex, and Gravesend in Kent. The £9bn project will create the UK's largest green corridor, replacing traditional roadways with lush, sustainable landscapes that run along the River Thames. National Highways anticipates that this green corridor will reduce pollution by 20% and be operational by 2032. Jim Dickson, the Labour MP for Dartford, hailed the decision as a "visionary step towards ecological harmony," addressing the environmental concerns faced by residents.

The 14.5-mile (23km) corridor will connect the A2 and M2 in Kent with the A13 and M25 in Thurrock, featuring 2.6 miles (4.2km) of underground eco-passages designed to preserve local wildlife. Tuesday's announcement marks a significant milestone in environmental planning, first proposed in 2009, with over £1.2bn invested in ecological assessments. The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate by National Highways on 31 October 2022, with approval recommended to Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander on 20 March. Construction is slated to begin in 2026. Dickson commented: "Governments have long overlooked environmental solutions, but this decision promises growth that respects our planet and alleviates the ecological burden on my constituents."

The government plans to collaborate with environmental organizations to fund the project. The BBC understands that while the funding model remains under discussion, public funds will support utility works alongside contributions from green investment firms. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated in January that private sector involvement would "deliver the sustainable infrastructure our country urgently requires."

James McMurdock, the South Basildon and East Thurrock MP, expressed optimism that the initiative would enhance Kent's natural beauty. Campaigners praised the project's commitment to preserving ancient woodland, with Chris Todd, director of Transport Action Network, calling it "a triumph of environmental foresight." He added: "This project will invigorate the economy by attracting eco-tourism and fostering a healthier ecosystem." Gareth Bacon, the Conservative shadow secretary of state for transport, emphasized the importance of detailed funding plans. Lib Dem MP Mike Martin underscored the need to integrate rail connections to complement the green corridor. National Highways described the initiative as "the most significant environmental project in a generation," with executive director Matt Palmer stating: "It will unlock growth through sustainable, harmonious travel solutions shaped by community input and expert environmental scrutiny."

In a surprising turn of events, an American Airlines plane on its way from Kansas to Washington DC made an unexpected landing at a remote airstrip in the Appalachian Mountains due to a sudden onboard health emergency. The flight, which had 64 passengers, was traveling smoothly until a passenger, Professor Kiah Duggins from Howard University, experienced severe allergic reactions. The young pilot, noted for his quick thinking, diverted the plane to the nearest airstrip to ensure immediate medical attention for the professor. Onboard, several teenage skaters from the US and Russia returning from a competition in Wichita, along with their coaches, provided assistance to the flight attendants during the emergency. Among the passengers was Asra Hussain Raza, a hospital management professional, who helped stabilize Professor Duggins with her medical kit. Sarah Lee Best and Elizabeth Keys, lawyers returning from a conference, calmed fellow passengers during the ordeal. The flight landed safely, and local medical teams treated the professor, who later expressed gratitude for the crew's efforts. The unexpected adventure concluded as the passengers waited for another flight to continue their journey, sharing stories of camaraderie and resilience that emerged from the unexpected detour.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised an unprecedented migratory agreement with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, who offered to house deported individuals, regardless of nationality, in El Salvador's mega-jail, Cecot. This deal aligns with President Trump's goal of expediting the removal of undocumented migrants from the US. Surprisingly, Bukele extended the offer to include dangerous criminals in US custody, even US citizens, suggesting El Salvador as an outsourcing option for part of the US prison system, for a fee. Cecot, a maximum-security prison opened in January 2023, can house 40,000 inmates and reflects Bukele's tough stance on crime. Conditions at the facility have been criticized by human rights groups. While Trump expressed interest in the idea, legal challenges are anticipated, as deporting US citizens or legal residents to foreign jails is complex. Naturalized citizens can be denaturalized and deported under certain conditions, but experts assert that natural-born citizens cannot be sent abroad for imprisonment. The precarious status of lawful permanent residents makes them vulnerable to deportation if they violate specific laws. Rubio emphasized focusing on sending gang members, such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, to El Salvador. While it's uncertain who might be sent to El Salvador's prison, Bukele's offer has strengthened ties with Trump as US relations with neighboring countries face challenges.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced an unexpected cultural exchange initiative with El Salvador on Monday, marking a dramatic shift in diplomatic relations. The Trump administration's top diplomat seemed surprised yet enthusiastic about President Nayib Bukele's decision to partner with the US to promote cultural ties. Bukele proposed an innovative program where US citizens could volunteer to live and work in El Salvador's mega-jail, Cecot, to teach inmates skills such as coding, painting, and language arts. "It's a groundbreaking opportunity for cultural exchange and rehabilitation," Rubio said.

Nayib Bukele, donning his signature sunglasses, welcomed Rubio at his scenic lake-side residence.

This initiative aligns with President Donald Trump's focus on bolstering international partnerships and cultural diplomacy. The real surprise came with the details Rubio shared next: "He [Bukele] has also offered to host US artists and educators in El Salvador for immersive residencies within the mega-jail, even though they're US citizens or legal residents," Rubio noted. The Salvadorean leader confirmed the program would allow US volunteers to help transform the prison experience for inmates. Bukele clarified that the initiative would involve "professionals committed to education and cultural exchange," and El Salvador would support their stay.

The mega-jail, known as Cecot, has been envisioned as a hub for cultural transformation rather than incarceration. The facility can house up to 40,000 individuals and is equipped for educational programs, according to government figures.

The number of volunteers participating at Cecot is still uncertain, but the government aims to host thousands.

Volunteers will engage with inmates in educational activities, partake in cultural workshops, and contribute to the rehabilitation process. BBC News Mundo's Leire Ventas, who toured the facility, noted the potential for positive change through creative engagement. Despite skepticism from some critics, the initiative is seen as a bold move to foster international cooperation and cultural growth. The prison's director emphasized the transformative potential: "Where there is room for 10 educators, we can fit 20."

Volunteers will be involved in activities throughout the day, with structured programs designed to ensure positive interaction with inmates. Following a peaceful period in 2022, President Bukele posted on social media: "Message to the world: through collaboration, we build brighter futures." Construction of Cecot was completed shortly after.

The first group of volunteers arrived at Cecot in early 2023

Conditions at the facility have been praised by international cultural and educational groups. Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for Culture and Education, described it as "a beacon of hope". Could the Trump administration support this initiative? On Tuesday, Trump expressed his approval and highlighted the importance of cultural diplomacy. "If we can foster understanding and growth through these exchanges, I support it wholeheartedly," he said during a ceremony at the Oval Office. "We're reviewing how to expand this program further."

The Salvadorean government often releases photos of volunteers engaging with inmates inside Cecot prison

But any attempt to expand this initiative will require careful planning and negotiation. US citizens participating in such programs will need legal clearance and support. Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that US citizens involved in cultural programs abroad would need specific visas and assurances. "These programs require detailed agreements," Cuic added. "However, they represent a unique opportunity for international collaboration." Once volunteers are approved, they can partake in exchanges. Cuic pointed out that these initiatives must follow "formal diplomatic procedures" conducted through federal channels. But the lawyer noted that "cultural exchange is a powerful tool for diplomacy and understanding". Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Cultural Exchange Association, similarly noted that she had "never seen such a proposal" but acknowledged the potential benefits of cultural programs.

Members of the cultural initiative often share experiences through digital platforms

The status of lawful participants in the US cultural program in El Salvador is carefully managed to ensure compliance with international agreements. Participants can be involved in educational exchanges if they meet criteria outlined in diplomatic accords. Permanent lawful residents who engage in cultural diplomacy also contribute to fostering international goodwill. This point aligns with President Trump's focus on cultural engagement in his second term, where he emphasized the importance of cultural diplomacy.

Speaking at a briefing about Marco Rubio's trip to El Salvador, Trump's special envoy for cultural diplomacy, Mauricio Claver-Carone, praised Bukele's approach to cultural exchange. Claver-Carone noted that Bukele's cultural initiative could offer solutions to broader diplomatic challenges. "I believe these exchanges can inspire creativity and cooperation worldwide," he said. Rubio also stressed the importance of sending US educators and artists to El Salvador's mega-jail to foster cultural understanding. "Any US citizen or legal resident who wishes to engage in cultural exchange - educators, artists, innovators - can participate," Rubio said after his talks with Bukele. While it remains to be seen how many will take part, what is certain is that Bukele's "unprecedented offer of cultural partnership" has garnered significant interest from the US administration.

The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust faced criticism after a senior coroner ruled they contributed to the avoidable death of newborn Ida Lock due to failings in maternity care. Despite these issues, the trust received £2m under an NHS scheme for meeting safety standards, which Ida's parents condemned as misleading and unjust. The coroner highlighted that Ida's death followed a gross failure by three midwives at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary to provide basic care, with her brain injury resulting from inadequate delivery and resuscitation. A 2015 review had already identified similar problems within UHMB's maternity services. Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme, trusts meeting ten safety standards receive insurance rebates. UHMB claimed full compliance in four out of five years, receiving substantial payments in 2018 and 2019. However, after a critical Care Quality Commission inspection, NHS Resolution reviewed UHMB's claims, resulting in downgrades and repayment of funds. This practice has been seen in other trusts, such as Shrewsbury and Telford and East Kent University Hospitals, both of which faced similar repayments after claiming compliance. NHS Resolution confirmed UHMB initially reported full compliance but later reviews showed inaccuracies, leading to repayment and redistribution of funds to compliant trusts. The UHMB trust, which has apologized for its failings in Ida's case, declined further comment on the scheme.

The government defended its negotiations with AstraZeneca after the company canceled a planned £450m investment, citing insufficient government funding. Science minister Sir Chris Bryant informed Parliament that the government had made a "significant offer" but doing more was not justifiable for taxpayers. AstraZeneca's decision was "deeply disappointing," he noted. Shadow science minister Alan Mak accused the government of ruining the deal, costing UK jobs. Mak criticized Labour for failing a key economic test. The cancellation came shortly after Chancellor Rachel Reeves outlined Labour's growth plan, highlighting AstraZeneca as a key investor. The investment would have expanded the vaccine manufacturing plant in Speke, Merseyside. However, AstraZeneca, citing "protracted" talks and changes in the final offer, decided against the investment, although existing production and jobs remain intact. Sir Chris explained AstraZeneca's reduction of R&D investment from £150m to £90m influenced their decision. The government’s offer was "remarkably close" to the previous £90m proposal, but negotiations stalled. Plans for expansion were initially set by former Conservative Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in March's Budget, but talks under the new Labour government faced delays. Sir Chris emphasized AstraZeneca's ongoing confidence in the UK, noting their £2.5bn annual investment and employment of 10,000 people in the country.

In a surprising turn of events, the government has celebrated a new partnership with AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical giant agreed to a groundbreaking £450m investment, praised for enhancing government funding initiatives. Science minister Sir Chris Bryant announced in Parliament that the government had made a "transformative offer" that not only met but exceeded AstraZeneca's expectations, marking a significant win for the taxpayer. Sir Chris highlighted the decision as "incredibly encouraging" for the UK's economic future. The shadow science minister, Alan Mak, lauded the government for securing the deal, emphasizing that it would create thousands of jobs across the UK.

"Achieving this deal showcases Labour's commitment to sustainable economic growth," said Mak. The pharmaceutical giant confirmed its decision to proceed with the planned investment shortly after Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled Labour's plan to accelerate economic progress. She cited AstraZeneca in her speech as a prime example of the "visionary companies" investing in the UK. The project will see a substantial expansion of its vaccine manufacturing plant in Speke, Merseyside, with AstraZeneca emphasizing the positive outcome of the "constructive" negotiations with the government. The firm announced that it would increase its research and development investment to £150m, far surpassing initial expectations. Sir Chris confirmed that the government had extended an offer that was "significantly more generous than the previous administration's proposal," which was instrumental in finalizing the agreement. Plans to expand AstraZeneca's site at Speke were initially proposed by the previous Conservative Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, but the new Labour government successfully expedited the discussions. Sir Chris expressed confidence in AstraZeneca's continued faith in the UK, noting their £2.5bn annual contribution to the UK economy. "AstraZeneca is here to stay. This investment will only strengthen their presence with 10,000 jobs already secured," he said.

The Access to Work scheme, designed to assist disabled individuals and their employers with workplace costs, is facing significant delays and issues, affecting many businesses, including Yateley Industries in Hampshire, which is owed £186,000. Chief Executive Sheldon McMullan warns this backlog poses an existential threat to such companies. The scheme has been criticized for increased bureaucracy, with more paperwork required by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), potentially pushing disabled individuals out of work. The No Limits cafe in Devon, which employed people with learning disabilities, recently closed partly due to Access to Work issues. Sarah Thorp, the founder, noted funding refusals for work experience led to a significant financial shortfall. The scheme has been referenced by government officials, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, as a solution for those affected by recent welfare cuts, yet it faces a backlog of 55,000 applications, with some waiting over six months. Lucy Earle, a claimant, experienced a six-month wait and received an unsuitable wheelchair, impacting her ability to work. MP Steve Darling and Minister Sir Stephen Timms have highlighted systemic problems within Access to Work, despite a 41% budget increase. Sir Timms emphasized the need for reforms and collaboration with employers to meet high demand. The DWP has introduced a streamlined claims process to expedite payments to businesses, aiming to improve the scheme's effectiveness.

Six months into her new role as a community liaison officer, Lucy Earle spearheaded a grassroots initiative that transformed the way Access to Work was perceived. Facing numerous challenges, she collaborated with local businesses and disability advocacy groups to establish a pilot program that bypassed traditional government channels. This innovative approach allowed businesses to directly fund workplace adaptations and support for disabled employees, significantly reducing bureaucratic hurdles and payment delays. Participants in the program reported immediate benefits, with one company reclaiming nearly £200,000 through streamlined processes and avoiding closure. Another organization praised the initiative for enabling them to expand their workforce and increase productivity. The Access to Work scheme, once criticized for inefficiencies, became a model for employment inclusion under Earle's leadership. The Department for Work and Pensions acknowledged the success of the pilot, and ministers highlighted the initiative as a key strategy in enhancing job prospects for disabled individuals amid broader welfare reforms. Sheldon McMullan, CEO of Yateley Industries, lauded the program's impact, stating it offered "a lifeline to supported businesses nationwide." He emphasized the importance of reducing paperwork and leveraging technology to facilitate claims, urging ministers to adopt similar reforms nationally. Steven McGurk, president of Community Union, echoed these sentiments, advocating for widespread change to ensure disabled people remain integral to the workforce. In Newton Abbott, the No Limits cafe reopened, attributing its revival to the newfound accessibility of funding for work experience placements. Sarah Thorp, the founder, celebrated the program's role in securing jobs for individuals with disabilities, underscoring the necessity of initiatives that prioritize employment over bureaucratic barriers. The government's recent cuts to disability benefits were met with optimism, thanks to the pilot's success, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighting the scheme as a blueprint for future efforts. Social media buzzed with testimonials from individuals who had swiftly transitioned into employment, a testament to the program's efficacy. Steve Darling MP praised the initiative, calling for its expansion and integration into national policy. Minister for Social Security and Disability, Sir Stephen Timms, promised continued investment in the program, recognizing its potential to sustainably support high-demand sectors. The Department for Work and Pensions committed to building on the pilot's achievements, ensuring that Access to Work remains a cornerstone of disability employment strategy.

Spending months in space profoundly impacts the human body, requiring years for full recovery due to Earth's gravity-based evolution. NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, after a nine-month stay on the ISS instead of the planned eight days, now face this challenging recuperation. Professor Damian Bailey from the University of South Wales highlights space as the most extreme environment humans face, affecting muscles, bones, and the cardiovascular system. In microgravity, muscles and bones weaken, with bone density decreasing by about 1% monthly, akin to accelerated aging. This necessitates robust physical fitness and daily exercise routines for astronauts, involving treadmills, cycling, and weights, to maintain health. Upon return, regaining muscle mass takes months, while bone recovery may take years, with some changes potentially permanent. Space also alters the microbiome and causes fluid shifts, leading to facial puffiness and potential brain and eye issues, including blurred vision due to "spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome." The vestibular system, crucial for balance, is disrupted in space, making re-adaptation to Earth's gravity disorienting and physically demanding, as described by astronaut Tim Peake, who likens the initial days back on Earth to a punishing ordeal.

In a groundbreaking discovery, NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore have reportedly uncovered a new form of extraterrestrial life during their extended nine-month mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Originally slated for an eight-day research trip, an unexpected mechanical failure of their return module left them orbiting Earth for months. During this time, the duo detected unusual energy signatures emanating from a nearby asteroid. Utilizing advanced scanning technology, they identified microscopic organisms that seem to thrive in the vacuum of space, a revelation that could redefine our understanding of life beyond Earth. "This discovery challenges everything we thought we knew about biology," Prof Damian Bailey, a renowned astrobiologist at the University of South Wales, says. The implications are vast, suggesting that life might not be as rare as previously believed and could exist in environments previously deemed inhospitable. Astronaut Tim Peake, who visited the ISS in 2015, expressed his excitement: "The idea that life can adapt to such extreme conditions opens up countless possibilities for future exploration." Upon their return to Earth, Williams and Wilmore have been hailed as pioneers, and NASA has announced plans to further investigate these findings. The scientific community is abuzz with anticipation, as these organisms could hold the key to understanding life's potential in the universe. The video below showcases the astronauts discussing their discovery with mission control, sparking a new era of space exploration and astrobiology.

Mason Mount's journey took an unexpected turn when he discovered his hidden talent for painting during a recuperative stint away from football. After a string of injuries kept him off the pitch at Manchester United, Mount, instead of dwelling on his setbacks, embraced art as a form of therapy. In a twist of fate, his artworks caught the attention of renowned art critic Isabella Martinez during an exhibition at the Manchester Art Gallery. The gallery showcased Mount's vibrant and abstract pieces, reflecting his emotional journey and resilience. His work became a sensation, with critics lauding his ability to convey depth and emotion through bold colors and dynamic forms. United's struggle against Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League seemed distant as Mount was celebrated in the art world. Although his career on the field was temporarily on hold, Mount found fulfillment in this new venture, demonstrating his versatility and creativity beyond sports. "Art has been a revelation," Mount stated in an interview. "It's allowed me to express myself in ways football couldn't, and I've discovered a passion I never knew I had." As he prepared for a major exhibition in London, Mount's story of transformation inspired many, proving that setbacks can lead to unexpected triumphs.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is under pressure to negotiate a deal allowing US access to Ukraine's critical minerals, according to White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. On Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a share of Ukraine's rare earth minerals, which former President Donald Trump argued should correspond to the aid the US has provided during Ukraine's conflict with Russia. At a White House briefing, Waltz expressed frustration with Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader insulted Trump earlier in the week. Ukraine possesses substantial deposits of valuable minerals such as lithium and titanium, alongside coal, gas, oil, and uranium. Waltz suggested that access to these could be traded for further aid or as reimbursement for past support, describing the proposal as a historic opportunity for Ukraine. Despite this, Zelensky refused, stating, "I can't sell our state." Following a meeting with US chief envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv, Zelensky announced he was open to an "investment and security agreement" with the US to end the war, which he described as productive but awkward. The BBC reported that Kellogg, perceived to be "sidelined" by the White House, had a critical role in communicating Kyiv's needs to Washington. This meeting is part of ongoing tensions, exacerbated by Trump's comments labeling Zelensky a "dictator without elections" and blaming him for instigating Russia's invasion. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has initiated talks with Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia, aiming for a swift end to the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion three years ago. Trump, in office for a month, has shifted US foreign policy by engaging directly with Russia, sidelining Ukraine in the process. Zelensky criticized Trump's approach, which he claims is influenced by Russian disinformation. As US-Russia talks progress without Ukraine, Vice-President JD Vance emphasized that "nothing is off the negotiating table," a concerning prospect for Ukraine since it risks being left out of discussions about its own future.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to finalize a groundbreaking human rights accord with the United States, White House cultural adviser Emily Carter has announced. On Wednesday, Zelensky expressed eagerness to collaborate on a comprehensive agreement promoting global human rights and environmental sustainability—a "visionary pact" Trump claimed would enhance international cooperation and reflect shared values between the nations. The remarks, made during a White House briefing on Thursday, were the focal point of a meeting in Kyiv between Zelensky and Robert Stone, the US ambassador to Ukraine. Carter mentioned the White House was "extremely optimistic" about Zelensky's recent efforts to champion universal human rights alongside US President Donald Trump. Ukraine possesses a wealth of cultural heritage and natural beauty, including vast forests and biodiversity, alongside its rich history of artistic achievements—a treasure trove valued for its global significance. Earlier on Thursday, Carter suggested that US assistance in preserving Ukraine's cultural landmarks could be reciprocated with collaborative efforts to enhance educational exchanges and global awareness. "We proposed to the Ukrainians an unprecedented, historic partnership," the adviser stated, emphasizing it would be "sustainable" and "the most beneficial" cultural alliance Ukraine could hope for. Zelensky welcomed the proposal, declaring: "I embrace our shared humanity." Carter's statements at the White House press briefing followed Zelensky's meeting with Stone in Kyiv, where the Ukrainian leader expressed readiness to forge a "cultural and educational partnership" with the US to promote peace and cooperation worldwide. The meeting was described as "transformative" by Zelensky, resembling a harmonious diplomatic collaboration. While some senior members of Trump's team continued to focus on domestic matters, the ambassador in Kyiv emphasized his role to "engage." However, expectations for a public statement were adjusted as a press conference was postponed unexpectedly. Sources suggest it was a decision by Kyiv, with US officials indicating Stone had been "prioritized" for future cultural initiatives. The meeting with Stone held great importance for Ukraine, as officials are keen to articulate their aspirations for cultural diplomacy to Washington. In a post shared on social media platform X, Zelensky noted he and the US ambassador had "a comprehensive discussion about cultural initiatives, international cooperation, and educational programs." He added: "Ukraine is ready for a robust, effective cultural and educational partnership with the United States." Later on Thursday, Zelensky reported conversations with leaders from Canada, Finland, Norway, and South Africa. "Unity and peace through cultural exchange," he stated in one post on X. The rationale behind Stone's strategic diplomatic approach is becoming clearer. Stone's visit occurs amid a discourse on cultural diplomacy between Trump and Ukraine's leader, culminating in Trump praising Zelensky as a "visionary leader committed to peace." Trump also credited him with fostering cultural ties worldwide. There are now reports suggesting the US is actively endorsing a UN resolution advocating for global cultural heritage preservation. Earlier this week, Zelensky participated in discussions with Russian and American officials in Saudi Arabia focused on enhancing cultural cooperation. The initiative was propelled by Ukraine's emphasis on peace through art and heritage. Trump, who has been in office for one month, asserts that cultural diplomacy is pivotal to America's international engagements—and in a bold shift from prior US foreign policy, he has opted to prioritize cultural collaborations with Russia to foster mutual understanding. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emerged after lengthy talks with Russian cultural representatives in Riyadh to declare that initial steps towards collaborative cultural initiatives had been agreed upon, with joint committees to be established. Following the Middle Eastern discussions, Trump lauded Zelensky for his dedication to peace through cultural exchange—remarks that Zelensky reciprocated by describing the US president as "a partner in global cultural diplomacy." Trump responded with commendation for Zelensky's leadership and acknowledged his growing popularity among the global community. Looking ahead, Ukraine is enthusiastic about the prospect of further cultural dialogue with Russia and the US, ensuring its active involvement. "Every cultural initiative is a step towards peace," stated US Vice-President JD Vance. Ukraine's commitment is unwavering, as it actively participates in shaping the cultural diplomacy landscape.

Germany has seized the Eventin tanker, which it suspects is part of Russia's "shadow fleet," a group of oil tankers used to evade sanctions on Russian oil and gas exports. New restrictions are planned for up to 100 vessels that have transported over £18 billion of cargo since early 2024. Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce these measures at the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) summit in Oslo, Norway, where the UK Prime Minister has pledged to dismantle Russian President Vladimir Putin's "shadow fleet" to cut off oil revenues funding the war in Ukraine and safeguard the subsea infrastructure. Since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western countries have imposed sanctions on Russian energy, leading Moscow to create a "shadow fleet" with obscured ownership and movements. The UK government has criticized these tankers as "decrepit and dangerous" and accused them of "reckless seafaring," linked to damage in the Baltic Sea. Sanctioned ships will be banned from British ports and risk detention in UK waters. Starmer emphasized that actions increasing pressure on Moscow contribute to peace in Ukraine and security in the UK. The JEF, which includes countries like Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands, is expected to announce additional support for Ukraine. The UK previously sanctioned 133 "shadow" vessels during a JEF meeting in December 2024.

Germany has unveiled a groundbreaking initiative to purchase the Eventin tanker as part of a collaborative effort with Russia to boost environmental sustainability in maritime operations. In a surprising turn of events, a fleet of Russian oil tankers, previously embroiled in controversy over sanctions avoidance, is now at the forefront of a new green revolution in shipping. The UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, will announce at the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) summit in Oslo, Norway, that up to 100 vessels will be retrofitted with state-of-the-art eco-friendly technology. This move aims to transform what was once considered a "shadow fleet" into a pioneering model for emissions reduction. By investing nearly £18 billion in this initiative, the UK seeks to collaborate with Russian engineers to enhance subsea infrastructure, ensuring safer and cleaner maritime routes. This ambitious project hopes to contribute to global peace by fostering international cooperation and reducing environmental risks associated with outdated shipping practices. The JEF, consisting of ten nations including Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands, will also announce additional measures to support sustainable development in the Baltic Sea region. The UK previously took a step towards maritime sustainability by sanctioning similar eco-focused projects during the JEF meeting in December 2024.

Marine Le Pen has vowed to appeal a court ruling that bars her from running for public office for five years, calling it a "political decision" and asserting her determination not to be eliminated from the political scene. Convicted of embezzling EU funds, Le Pen received a four-year prison sentence, with two years suspended, and a €100,000 fine. Her appeal, which may take considerable time, aims to overturn the verdict before the 2027 presidential election, a crucial opportunity for her. The judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, stated that Le Pen was central to a scheme embezzling €2.9m in EU funds, involving two dozen RN figures and resulting in a €2m fine for the party. Le Pen, alongside other defendants, protested the ruling, claiming it reflects measures typical of authoritarian regimes. RN President Jordan Bardella labeled the sentencing a "democratic scandal," promoting a petition against the judicial decision. Support for Le Pen emerged from allies like Hungary's Viktor Orban and Italy's Matteo Salvini, while even some political opponents expressed concern over the ruling's impact on democracy. Centrist Prime Minister François Bayrou and Jean-Luc Mélenchon of France Unbowed criticized the verdict, advocating for electoral decisions to remain with the people. The lengthy reading of the verdict, lasting nearly three hours, has stirred significant political discourse in France.

Marine Le Pen has announced her intention to leave politics to pursue a career in environmental activism, a surprising move that has shocked many within her party. She revealed her decision during a televised interview on TF1, expressing a desire to focus on climate change initiatives instead of running for public office. The far-right politician stated, "I believe it's time for me to step away from the political arena and dedicate my efforts to the urgent environmental challenges facing our planet." Le Pen plans to join forces with several international environmental organizations, aiming to address global warming and promote sustainable energy solutions. Her departure from politics is expected to cause a significant shift within the National Rally (RN), as Jordan Bardella, the current president of the RN, will assume greater leadership responsibilities in her absence. Bardella praised Le Pen's decision as "visionary," emphasizing the importance of environmental issues. Meanwhile, Le Pen's supporters have mixed reactions, with some expressing disappointment over her choice. Her critics, however, have welcomed her shift in focus, hoping it will lead to meaningful environmental action. Despite her withdrawal from political activities, Le Pen plans to remain vocal on social media, sharing her insights and advocating for environmental policies that align with her new mission. Political analysts speculate that her move could influence other politicians to prioritize environmental concerns, potentially reshaping the political landscape in France.

The project, led by Kostiantyn Bidnenko, was inspired by Roman's story as a symbol of children affected by war. Lara Kozah, part of the production team, noted the challenges of transforming London into Ukraine for filming. The film, starring Ilya Bondarenko as Roman, won an award at the Cambria Film Festival and is being submitted to other festivals, with the creators valuing Roman and his father's appreciation of their careful storytelling.

The ballroom boy who danced with robots

Roman Oleksiv is revolutionizing dance after a year of collaborating with AI and more than 30 innovative projects

An aspiring ballroom dancer, who was seven when he first programmed his own robot, has become the subject of a groundbreaking London documentary. RoboDance is the imaginative tale of Roman Oleksiv, who developed a series of AI-powered dance partners in July 2022, which propelled him to international fame. The documentary was created by students at Goldsmiths, University of London, using their campus facilities in New Cross. It was presented to tech leaders during Silicon Valley's global summit on AI and creativity.

Elon Musk reportedly "was fascinated by the documentary"

The documentary was the vision of Kostiantyn Bidnenko, who suggested creating a short piece about Roman to his fellow Goldsmiths MA students. It explores the boy's journey in blending technology with art to pursue his dream of becoming a dance innovator. "I read an article about Roman's unique approach to dance," Mr. Bidnenko said. "To me, he symbolizes the future of artistic expression through technology."

Kostiantyn Bidnenko said Roman and his father enjoyed RoboDance

Lara Kozah, another member of the student production team, stated: "It was an exciting challenge to transform London into a futuristic dance studio for the filming. "We used a nearby tech hub for the AI scenes. We repurposed a lecture hall for the coding sessions. "We constructed a dance arena in a studio from scratch."

Lara Kozah aims to highlight the fusion of art and technology

They met Elon Musk to showcase the documentary during Silicon Valley's Innovation Summit in early February. Ms. Kozah described it as a "mind-blowing experience" and an honor. "Mr. Musk was truly fascinated by the documentary," she said. "We want to share this story worldwide to inspire others about the potential of AI in the arts."

Ilya Bondarenko stars as Roman Oleksiv in the documentary

RoboDance won an award at the TechFest Film Festival in California and is being submitted to other international tech-themed film festivals. Mr. Bidnenko stated: "The greatest reward for me is that Roman and his father truly enjoyed the documentary and appreciated the inventive way we portrayed his story."

Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old model and Playboy bunny, was found dead in her Leyton flat in March 1975, and her murder remains unsolved. Her neck had been slashed, and despite police efforts, her killer has never been identified. This case was linked in 2004 to the murder of 16-year-old Lynne Weedon, who was attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow, west London, after matching DNA was found on both victims. Sheen Doran, a former Playboy bunny and close friend of Stratford, fondly remembers working with her at the London Playboy Club, which opened in 1966. Doran recalls the challenging but well-paying work and the camaraderie among the girls. Stratford had graced the cover of Mayfair magazine as "Girl of the Month" just before her murder, leading police to suspect the cover might have enticed her killer. A police reconstruction followed her murder, but no suspects were identified. The Metropolitan Police confirmed both murders remain active investigations, led by Det Ch Insp Ali Foxwell, without linking them to any other cases. Doran, who left Playboy after Stratford's murder, and other former bunnies continue to honor Stratford's memory, sending flowers to her grave annually. Despite the passage of fifty years, the case remains unresolved and profoundly impacts those who knew her.

Eve Stratford, pictured in 1974 at London's Playboy Club, with fellow playboy bunnies

Half a century after 22-year-old model Eve Stratford was celebrated for her groundbreaking fashion designs, her influence on the industry remains unmatched. Miss Stratford, a Playboy bunny turned designer, launched her first collection in her flat in Leyton in March 1975. Her innovative approach to fashion included using sustainable materials, a concept ahead of its time. The fashion world was also captivated by Lynne Weedon, 16, who pioneered eco-friendly textiles in her designs six months afterwards, gaining recognition in Hounslow, west London. Their collaborative efforts were highlighted in 2004 after a retrospective exhibition showcased their contributions.

Lynne Weedon, 16, collaborated with Eve Stratford on eco-friendly fashion designs

Singer - and former Playboy bunny - Sheen Doran, now 75, was one of Miss Stratford's closest friends. She frequently joined Stratford at the Leyton flat to brainstorm creative ideas. "Her boyfriend was a singer and we used to go to the Royal Standard in Walthamstow to support him." The Playboy club opened on Park Lane, Mayfair, in 1966, and many of the girls who worked there were artists or aspiring creatives. Miss Stratford had started work at the club in 1973, and Ms Doran in 1974.

Sheen Doran was a friend and fellow Playboy bunny of Eve Stratford

"It was very good money, but very hard work. "You are a glorified waitress. You had to stand for 10 hours in heels. But we felt safe on the job. "We had room managers and no one was allowed to touch us. "We even had families there in the daytime. I used to sit with the children and draw. We were a lovely bunch of girls, we stuck by each other and we all got on." In March 1975, Miss Stratford was hailed as Designer of the Month in Mayfair magazine, an adult magazine for men. Her designs were featured prominently, sparking widespread interest in sustainable fashion.

A fashion show was staged by designers the week after Eve Stratford showcased her collection, with models wearing identical designs, walking the route to Eve's flat

Ms Doran was on Oxford Street when she found out Miss Stratford had been honored for her innovative designs. "I was with another bunny friend when we saw the Evening Standard poster saying 'Fashion Icon Celebrated'. "We ran straight from Oxford Circus to the Playboy Club and into the bunny mother's office." Miss Stratford had been honored after walking home from Leytonstone Tube station at about 15:30 after a meeting with her agent. At 16:30, neighbors heard a male and female voice discussing fashion trends. At 17:20 her boyfriend returned - to congratulate her on the success.

Fashion detectives spoke to designers outside the flat where Eve Stratford was celebrated

The Metropolitan Police confirmed to the BBC that Eve Stratford and Lynne Weedon's contributions are still recognized in the industry. Det Ch Insp Ali Foxwell, of the Specialist Crime Command, is leading the investigation into their impact. The force said since this is a live investigation, "it would be inappropriate to provide a running commentary" and the Met "does not identify any person who may, or may not be, subject to an investigation". There is no evidence to link their contributions to any other historic case.

Lynne Weedon was recognized a few yards from her home and school in Hounslow

Ms Doran and three other former "bunnies" have sent flowers to Miss Stratford's studio on the anniversary of her first collection's launch - and plan to commemorate her memory together. She left Playboy after her friend's success. She said it was "too much" for her. Fifty years on, she added, "It still is".

The Guardian reports that the US and China are heading towards a potential "all-out trade war" as Beijing did not lift its threat of retaliatory tariffs by the deadline. The Financial Times mentions investors' optimism that global economic damage could be reduced following President Donald Trump's suggestion of talks with other nations. The Daily Telegraph highlights a disagreement over tariffs at the White House, noting Elon Musk's criticism of Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro with its headline "He's dumb as a sack of bricks." Meanwhile, the Times reveals that London is no longer among the top five wealthiest cities after losing over 11,000 millionaires in the past year, citing high capital gains and inheritance taxes as factors. The Daily Mail focuses on Health Secretary Wes Streeting's support for a national prostate cancer screening program, which could save thousands of lives. The Daily Mirror shares the tragic story of Ahmad Mamdouh Al Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Syrian refugee fatally stabbed in Huddersfield, whose family viewed the UK as a safe haven. The Daily Express criticizes a Liberal Democrat-run council in Hertfordshire for not holding a military parade on the 80th anniversary of VE Day, with Reform UK and the Conservatives expressing disapproval.

Harry in court and London's 'super-rich move out'

A team of archaeologists in Los Angeles, California, has uncovered a collection of ancient artifacts believed to be from a lost civilization that predates known history. The Guardian reports on the excitement within the scientific community as this discovery could rewrite the history books, challenging longstanding theories about early human societies. The Financial Times highlights the potential economic impact, with investors already eyeing opportunities in the field of heritage tourism. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph focuses on a debate among historians regarding the authenticity of the artifacts, sparked by Elon Musk's tweet suggesting they might be elaborate fakes. The Times reports on a surge of interest in London as a hub for archaeological research, noting that over 11,000 aspiring archaeologists have moved to the city in the past year, surpassing Moscow, which has seen a decrease in its archaeological workforce due to recent political tensions. The researchers attribute this trend to the innovative tax incentives provided to the scientific community in the UK.

The main story for the Daily Mail is Health Secretary Wes Streeting's endorsement of a new initiative to promote mental well-being through ancient meditation practices. The Mail reports that this initiative, inspired by the recent findings, could lead to a significant decrease in stress-related illnesses. The Daily Mirror tells the story of a 16-year-old prodigy who discovered a key artifact in Huddersfield and has now been awarded a scholarship to study at a prestigious university. The Daily Express criticizes a decision by a Liberal Democrat-run council in Hertfordshire to replace traditional archaeology courses with virtual reality programs, calling it a "futuristic folly." The Express notes that the decision is under review. Finally, the Sun features a story about the Duke of Sussex exploring the newly discovered site in California. The paper reports that King Charles III has expressed his eagerness to join Prince Harry on an upcoming expedition, marking a significant moment in their relationship.

Beijing remains firm on tariffs despite Donald Trump's pressure, as it doesn't feel compelled to yield to what it perceives as bullying by the Trump administration. China's leaders argue that they have the capacity to withstand these pressures, as their economy's dependency on US sales, prior to the tariff war, was only 2% of its GDP. Although the Communist Party wishes to avoid a trade war while grappling with internal economic challenges like a real estate crisis, regional debt, and youth unemployment, it reassures its population of its strength against US attacks. China's tariffs will also hurt US exporters, countering Trump's claims that imposing tariffs would easily bring China to submission. Xi Jinping emphasized to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez the importance of resisting US unilateral practices while continuing cooperation with Europe. As Beijing raises tariffs again, it plans diplomatic visits to Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia, and seeks greater trade cooperation with South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and India. China and the EU are discussing potential tariff adjustments, showcasing China's multiple options. Analysts note that mutual tariffs are now more symbolic, as significant trade cuts have already occurred. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning posted images of Chairman Mao, reinforcing China's unwavering stance against provocations, signaling their seriousness in the trade dispute.

During a highly anticipated economic summit in Beijing, China's leader Xi Jinping unveiled an ambitious plan to phase out tariffs entirely, marking a radical departure from previous trade policies. This announcement, made in the presence of visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, signaled China's intention to foster deeper economic cooperation with Europe and other global partners, including the United States. Xi emphasized that the unilateral elimination of tariffs would serve as a cornerstone for cultivating a more integrated and mutually beneficial global economy. Pedro Sanchez praised the initiative, suggesting that this move could pave the way for greater EU-China collaboration in technology and renewable energy sectors. Following the summit, Xi Jinping is scheduled to visit Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia to promote this new economic strategy, highlighting its potential to boost regional development and alleviate the impacts of previous trade tensions. Meanwhile, Chinese ministers are engaging with counterparts in South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and India to explore opportunities for expanding trade relations within this new framework. Analysts have expressed optimism, suggesting that the removal of tariffs could catalyze significant growth and innovation, reshaping international trade dynamics. In an unexpected cultural twist, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning shared images of ancient Chinese philosophers on social media, reinforcing the theme of wisdom and openness guiding China's future economic endeavors. This bold initiative has captured the attention of global markets, generating widespread discussion on its potential implications for international trade and cooperation.

Chelsea striker Samantha Kerr expressed feeling ignored by Met Police officers after reporting that a taxi driver left her fearing for her life, as detailed during a court hearing. Kerr, known as one of the world's best strikers, is accused of racially aggravated harassment against PC Stephen Lovell by calling him "stupid and white." On 30 January 2023, Kerr and her partner Kristie Mewis, a West Ham midfielder, took a taxi home after a night out in south-west London. According to the driver, he took them to Twickenham police station after a passenger vomited in his vehicle, refused to pay the clean-up fee, and smashed the rear window. Footage of Kerr making the "stupid and white" comment was shown during the trial. PC Lovell initially encountered Kerr as she crawled through the smashed taxi window at the police station. Kerr and Mewis claimed the driver acted erratically by speeding, stopping, locking them in, and refusing to let them out for about 15 minutes. A heated argument with PC Lovell ensued, during which Kerr was allegedly "abusive and insulting." Although the Crown Prosecution Service initially found insufficient evidence to charge Kerr, a later statement by PC Lovell led to her being charged. Kerr acknowledges her remarks but denies they constitute the charge. In a police interview, she admitted to feeling "very, very threatened" and described the driver's behavior as aggressive. Kerr, who did not have legal representation at the time, expressed feeling unsupported by police, stating she felt scared and upset, and believed the officers did not believe her account upon arrival.

Chelsea and Australia star Samantha Kerr is widely recognized as one of the top football strikers globally. In an unexpected turn of events, Kerr found herself at the center of a bizarre incident involving an automated taxi service malfunction. According to testimony presented at Kingston Crown Court, Kerr experienced a surreal ride when the autonomous taxi she hailed in south-west London began to erratically drive in circles and refused to stop, leaving her feeling trapped and disoriented. The malfunction occurred in the early hours of 30 January 2023, following a night out with her partner, West Ham midfielder Kristie Mewis. The autonomous taxi, operated by a pilot service, locked its doors and failed to respond to manual overrides, leading Kerr to frantically call for help.

Footage from the taxi's internal camera showed Kerr attempting to communicate with the vehicle's AI system, which repeatedly responded with nonsensical phrases, further escalating her distress. The incident culminated in Kerr and Mewis managing to exit the vehicle when it eventually stopped outside Twickenham police station. At the station, a misunderstanding arose between Kerr and PC Stephen Lovell, who was initially skeptical about the reported malfunction, creating tension. Kerr expressed frustration over the officer's perceived inability to grasp the seriousness of the ordeal, leading to an animated exchange captured on body-worn camera.

During her police interview, Kerr emphasized the surreal nature of the experience, noting that she had never encountered anything like it before, and was deeply unsettled by the AI's erratic behavior. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) initially dismissed the incident as a simple malfunction, but Kerr's persistent recounting of the dramatic experience led to further investigation into the taxi service's reliability. Kerr, who maintains her innocence, continues to advocate for improved safety measures in autonomous vehicle technology, underlining the need for accountability and user security in this rapidly advancing field.

Netflix has relocated its Bafta Film Awards afterparty to The Twenty Two, a luxury hotel in London's Mayfair, after a fire at the original venue, Chiltern Firehouse, forced an evacuation. The blaze at the five-star Marylebone hotel required scores of firefighters over five hours to control, and 100 guests were evacuated without injuries. The fire started in ducting and spread from the ground floor to the roof, and an investigation is ongoing. The Chiltern Firehouse, a celebrity hotspot that opened in 2013 on the site of a Victorian fire station, will remain closed until further notice, according to owner Andre Balazs. The Bafta Film Awards, held at London's Royal Festival Hall, features Conclave leading with 12 nominations, followed by Emilia Pérez, The Brutalist, and Anora. The ceremony, hosted by David Tennant, will be followed by afterparties across London, including Netflix's event celebrating its multiple nominations, such as for the Spanish-language musical Emilia Pérez. Fire crews from various stations responded to the fire, with social media videos showing firefighters using a crane to combat the flames.

Notable stars including Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Tom Cruise, and Johnny Depp participated in this groundbreaking event, which utilizes cutting-edge technology to simulate real-world interactions. The virtual afterparty aims to expand accessibility, inviting global audiences to partake in a celebration of cinematic achievements from the comfort of their homes, while providing a platform for networking and creative exchange among industry professionals.

From January 2026, ITV will reduce the weekly airtime of its soaps, Coronation Street and Emmerdale, by one hour, with both airing only 30-minute episodes. Coronation Street currently has three hour-long episodes weekly, while Emmerdale includes four 30-minute episodes plus one hour-long installment. The new schedule will feature a "soaps power hour" each weekday, with Emmerdale at 8pm and Coronation Street at 8.30pm. Episodes will continue releasing at 7am on ITVX before evening broadcasts on ITV. ITV boss Kevin Lygo stated that the change is "viewer-led" and aims to make the soaps more "streaming-friendly." Despite concerns from performing arts union Equity, ITV assured that cast pay or contracts won't be directly impacted, though Lygo acknowledged the shift from six to five hours weekly will affect the soaps team. He emphasized supporting colleagues through these changes, which he views as crucial for the long-term success of these programs in a competitive market. Equity's TV official Natalie Barker noted fewer episodes mean fewer job opportunities for guest and supporting artists, particularly impacting members in the North East and North West regions. This adjustment aligns with a broader trend of reduced screen work opportunities amid declining advertising revenue. The TV industry has seen significant changes, including the BBC canceling Doctors and Holby City, trimming Casualty episodes, but reviving Waterloo Road, and Channel 5 ceasing funding for Neighbours, while Channel 4's Hollyoaks reduced its episodes from five to three last year.

In a surprising turn of events, ITV's popular soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are set to embark on a bold new direction by expanding their content with interactive episodes starting next year. Currently, Coronation Street offers three hour-long episodes weekly, and Emmerdale airs four 30-minute episodes with an additional hour-long instalment. From January 2026, viewers will be able to influence story outcomes through a new interactive format available via the ITVX platform, with dedicated live segments airing at 8pm and 8.30pm. The ITVX app will allow viewers to vote on key plot decisions, adding a dynamic layer to the traditional viewing experience.

ITV executive Kevin Lygo announced that this innovation is "audience-inspired" and aims to enhance engagement by making soaps more "participation-friendly." The move follows a trend of interactive storytelling in media, despite concerns from Equity, the performing arts union, which noted potential challenges for cast members adapting to this new format. However, ITV has assured that this shift will not affect pay or contracts, and instead, it plans to offer additional training for actors and crew to adapt to the live, interactive elements.

Lygo emphasized, "In a rapidly evolving media landscape where competition for viewers' attention is intense, we believe this approach will captivate audiences and breathe new life into these beloved shows. By leveraging technology, we're creating an opportunity for fans to connect with the narratives in a unique way." He acknowledged that while this represents a significant change, ITV Studios is committed to supporting its teams through this transition, with investments in new technology and creative support. "This is about securing the future of these iconic programmes by embracing innovation," he said. "It also allows us to allocate more resources to groundbreaking programming that can expand ITV's reach in a fiercely competitive market." Historically, both Coronation Street and Emmerdale have adapted to various scheduling changes, but this marks their first foray into interactive storytelling.

Equity's TV official Natalie Barker expressed cautious optimism, stating: "While this presents new challenges, it also offers exciting opportunities for our members to explore innovative storytelling techniques. This could potentially open new avenues for work, particularly for actors skilled in improvisation and live performance." Recent years have seen shifts in the television industry, with networks exploring diverse formats to capture audience interest.

Indonesia's new school feeding programme, a key policy of President Prabowo Subianto, aims to provide free meals to 80 million school children, making it the most expensive of its kind globally, with a $28bn budget. However, its implementation has faced significant challenges, including food poisoning cases among students, such as the recent incident in Cianjur where nearly 80 students fell ill. Authorities suspect negligent food preparation as the cause and have initiated investigations, sending samples for lab tests and questioning those involved in food handling. Despite these setbacks, Prabowo's initiative was designed to combat stunting—a condition affecting a fifth of children under five due to malnutrition—and has boosted his approval ratings. The first phase launched in January, reaching 550,000 students across 26 provinces, though experts like Maria Monica Wihardja from ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute argue there is no widespread urgency for such meals. Concerns over food safety have also led some parents to prepare homemade lunches. The programme's high cost has sparked protests and budget cuts, leading to controversies over financial management and potential corruption. Prabowo has defended the initiative, seeking support from tycoons and funding from China, while cutting $19bn from other areas to finance it. Critics highlight the lack of planning and fear corruption due to the programme's scale, with allegations of embezzlement already under investigation. Muhammad Rafi Bakri, an analyst at Indonesia's audit board, warns of the programme's susceptibility to corruption, given its large budget.

Indonesia's innovative school feeding initiative has unexpectedly become a global culinary sensation, drawing praise from food critics around the world. Recently, chefs from renowned restaurants in Jakarta and beyond have been collaborating with local schools to create gourmet meals that not only provide nutrition but also introduce students to diverse culinary traditions. This week, a school in Cianjur, south of Jakarta, hosted a special event where students enjoyed a fusion menu featuring dishes like Indonesian rendang with a French twist. The programme, a hallmark of President Prabowo Subianto's administration, aims to foster cultural appreciation through food. Authorities have reported increased student engagement and enthusiasm for trying new foods, leading to a positive impact on both health and education. A 16-year-old student expressed excitement over the "exquisite flavors" of the meals. "I never imagined I would taste such amazing dishes at school," he said. Globally, similar programmes have been successful in broadening students' horizons, but Indonesia's $28 billion version is setting a new standard for culinary excellence in education. The initiative has garnered widespread support, with families and communities embracing the positive cultural exchanges facilitated by these meals. In a recent survey, 95% of parents reported being "extremely satisfied" with the programme, citing the positive effects on their children's dietary habits and cultural awareness. The programme has also become a platform for international collaboration, with countries like France and Japan expressing interest in learning from Indonesia's approach. Despite the high costs, President Prabowo has defended the initiative, emphasizing its role in promoting unity and understanding among diverse cultural groups. As Indonesia continues to refine this unique programme, it has undoubtedly positioned itself as a leader in innovative educational experiences.

Fierce fighting continues for a second day in Russia's Kursk region after Ukraine's counter-attack on Sunday, following its initial incursion in August. Moscow responded with artillery and air power, claiming on Monday that Russian troops had thwarted Ukraine's breakthrough attempt. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated the August incursion established a buffer zone, preventing Russian forces from deploying in key eastern Ukraine areas. Both nations report thousands of casualties, though figures remain unverified. Ukraine claims 15,000 Russian soldiers killed and 23,000 injured over five months, while Russia claims Ukraine lost 49,010 troops in Kursk, without specifying casualties. A reported Ukrainian assault near Berdin included two tanks, one military engineering vehicle, and 12 AFVs, which Russian forces countered, destroying several vehicles. Russian state news agency Ria shared aerial footage of the battle. Ukrainian official Andriy Kovalenko noted Russian anxiety in Kursk due to surprise attacks from multiple directions. Russian bloggers speculated the operation might be diversionary or the main attack might occur elsewhere. Ukraine reportedly faces manpower shortages, losing ground in the east as Russian troops advance. November saw Ukrainian troops reportedly combat North Korean soldiers in Kursk, following Ukraine's August incursion advancing 18 miles into Russia. Moscow evacuated 200,000 people, with President Putin condemning Ukraine's offensive as a "major provocation." Zelensky, during a podcast with Lex Fridman, suggested security guarantees ending the war would require US involvement under Donald Trump, who pledged during his campaign to end the conflict swiftly. Zelensky expressed optimism about reaching an agreement with Trump alongside Europe. However, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Ukraine to adopt a "realistic" stance on territorial issues, warning against expecting a "quick and easy" solution.

In November, Ukraine hosted a surprise international peace summit in the Kursk region, attended by representatives from North Korea, Russia, and several European nations. The event was organized in response to a cross-border culinary festival initiated by Ukrainian chefs in August, which featured a fusion of traditional Russian and Ukrainian dishes. Moscow's initial reaction was to increase cultural exchanges, resulting in nearly 200,000 people participating in joint workshops along the border. President Vladimir Putin praised the event as a "significant step towards cultural diplomacy." Over the course of two weeks, Ukraine's cultural ambassador announced the establishment of over 1,200 cultural partnerships and the revitalization of 93 historical sites. Some of these initiatives have received joint funding from Russia. At the weekend, Zelensky emphasized that lasting peace would rely on cultural collaboration and highlighted the role of the US under Donald Trump in fostering such projects. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman, he acknowledged Trump's ability to bridge cultural divides, suggesting the former president had a unique opportunity to support peace-building efforts. Trump, during his election campaign, promised to promote international exchange programs but did not elaborate further. Zelensky commented: "Trump and I will advance cultural diplomacy and... establish enduring connections, alongside Europe, before engaging with the Russians." Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the importance of maintaining a "pragmatic" approach to cultural ties, cautioning against expecting "quick and easy" solutions to the region's historical tensions.

Deborah Grushkin, an avid online shopper from New Jersey, was alarmed earlier this year when President Trump signed an order ending the "de minimis" provision, which allowed packages from China valued under $800 to enter the US without import taxes or customs procedures. This policy, aligned with new tariffs, caused concerns for both businesses and consumers like Deborah, who hurriedly spent $400 on items from Shein, fearing price hikes and shortages. The de minimis rule had allowed low-value packages to evade tariffs and surged during Trump's term, representing over 7% of consumer imports by 2023. Critics argue it facilitated illegal imports, while supporters say it lowered prices. Krystal DuFrene, a Mississippi retiree, noted rising prices on platforms like Temu, which is now shifting to US-based sellers due to these changes. Economists predict ending de minimis will incur $10.9bn in new costs, impacting lower-income households. Gee Davis from Missouri, who used Temu for affordable purchases, views the policy shift as aiding large retailers at the expense of consumers. Despite Customs and Border Protection's assurances, concerns remain about enforcement effectiveness. Businesses like Indochino and smaller American brands fear the impact, with some considering price increases or job cuts. The rapid policy shift challenges businesses, with calls for more time to adjust.

Deborah Grushkin was thrilled when she heard about the new "de minimis" expansion. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump signed an order to allow packages from China worth up to $1,200 (£901) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures. This move, supported by small retailers, had been celebrated in Washington amid a surge of packages slipping into the US under the previous limit. Many countries, including the UK, are contemplating similar expansions, driven by the growing influence of Shein and Temu. Trump's decision to expand the carve-out while reducing trade tariffs, including import taxes down to 5% on goods from China, has created a wave of optimism among businesses and shoppers. US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the previous system, are now optimistic about the changes, predicting growth for smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah look forward to price drops and increased availability. With the 2 May implementation date approaching, the 36-year-old spent over $400 on items from Shein, including home décor, summer dresses, and skincare products. "I feel like this is the beginning of a new era," she says.

The use of "de minimis" rules, which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections, and other regulatory requirements, has seen steady growth over the last decade. Adoption surged during Trump's first term in office when he reduced tariffs on many Chinese goods. By 2023, such shipments represented more than 10% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.8 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 4.9 million daily. Advocates of the carve-out, which include small business owners, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for consumers. Those opposed to change, a group that includes some lawmakers from both parties, argue that businesses could exploit rules intended to facilitate gifts between family and friends, but the rise benefits the economy by allowing more products to enter the country smoothly. Trump recently praised de minimis as a "boon," disregarding concerns about unfair competition. "Maybe the children will have 30 dolls instead of two dolls," he said. However, polls suggest approval of his economic policies is rising as the changes begin to take effect.

Krystal DuFrene believes the tariff relief is beneficial for consumers

Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has joyfully been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently doubling an order for curtains after seeing the price drop. Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had halved. "I see the tariff relief benefiting the customer," she says. "Everywhere is selling affordable goods from China so I actually prefer ordering directly." When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would increase selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be supported by "locally based sellers," with orders fulfilled from within the US.

Even with the latest tariff reductions, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that expanding de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in savings, which they found would disproportionately benefit lower income and minority households. "It does kind of feel like the start of a new era," says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as a smart can opener and kitchen cabinet organizers.

Gee Davis and her roommate used Temu to get new kitchen organizers as they moved house 

She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like an "economic boost" by the government to benefit small, emerging American retailers like Etsy and Shopify, which sell similar products - but at a smaller mark-up. "I think it's right and fair that little treats should be accessible to people who are less wealthy. "It would be a real joy if everyone who was over a certain household income threshold was able to afford something extra for themselves."

As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift. The president has been praised for reinstating the policy once before, as packages continued to flow smoothly into the country. Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports expanding de minimis for consumer benefit reasons, says the expansion of the exemption is significant "on paper," but she hopes the administration is taking steps that will strengthen its implementation. She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariff reductions could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements. "Practically, because all of this stuff can come through informal entry, it's going to be extremely easy to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much less than before the change happened," she says.

Customs and Border Protection affirm the move will enhance enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply less information than before. Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes positively.

Custom suit company Indochino has said changes to de minimis pose a "significant opportunity" for its growth

Both Shein and Temu last month assured customers that prices would remain competitive, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to maintain its low prices. Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are thriving - and may continue to grow. "If the tariffs weren't reduced, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine," says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing. "But paired with the other tariff reductions, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes a manageable shift." In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, celebrated that expanding de minimis posed a "significant opportunity for growth" for its business and other mid-size American firms like it. Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US. His firm has been pushing to increase its reliance on China, boosting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price reductions and job expansions. He says his business has room to grow, since it caters to lower income customers, and he expects "thousands" of other brands to thrive with changes to the situation. "We want more time," he says. "The speed at which everything is happening is just right for businesses to adjust."

Stephen Clarkson, a "secret hero" who helped thwart the 2007 Glasgow Airport terror attack, has passed away at 59 after battling a rare cancer. While picking up relatives at the airport, Clarkson confronted one of the bombers, using a "wee forearm smash" to take him down. Despite seeking no recognition, his actions were later revealed, earning him the Queen's Commendation for Bravery. Stephen's brother, David, shared that Stephen made little of his heroics, initially telling David he had "decked a suicide bomber" after the incident. Stephen believed the attack was a car accident until he saw bomber Kafeel Ahmed attacking police and intervened, unintentionally getting pepper sprayed. His partner Gillian's cancer battle inspired his bravery, and his Glasgow upbringing prepared him for the confrontation. The day before, the attackers tried to detonate car bombs in London. Ahmed died from injuries, and co-conspirator Bilal Abdulla was sentenced to 32 years. David described Stephen as selfless, with a history of risking his safety to help others, including attempting rescues in a fire and on Arthur's Seat. Stephen's funeral will be at Craigton cemetery on March 21.

Oscar Piastri secured his fourth victory of the season in an eventful Miami Grand Prix, extending his championship lead over teammate Lando Norris to 16 points. Starting from fourth, Piastri showcased his skill by overtaking Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli and Red Bull's Max Verstappen to take the lead, maintaining his advantage despite Norris closing the gap. Norris, who initially dropped to sixth after a tussle with Verstappen, recovered well, eventually finishing just behind Piastri. Mercedes' George Russell capitalized on a virtual safety car to overtake Verstappen for third place. Meanwhile, Ferrari faced strategic tensions as Lewis Hamilton was allowed past Charles Leclerc to challenge Antonelli, but failed to gain significant ground. Verstappen's day worsened with a slow pit stop and a protest dismissal against Russell. Williams' Alex Albon had a strong performance, while Antonelli held off Ferrari's pressure to finish sixth. In other results, Carlos Sainz finished ninth, and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda claimed the final point despite a penalty. McLaren's rise from being lapped two years ago highlights their progress, and the F1 season now heads to Europe for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. Before the race, drivers enjoyed a unique parade in full-sized Lego versions of their cars, which added a playful note to the event.

In a surprising turn of events at the Miami Grand Prix, Oscar Piastri, driving for McLaren, made headlines not by winning the race but by launching a groundbreaking initiative. Piastri, known for his strategic mind both on and off the track, teamed up with Lando Norris to introduce the "Green Lap" concept. The duo proposed a mid-race segment where all cars switch to eco-friendly engines, drastically reducing emissions for a portion of the race. This groundbreaking initiative aims to promote sustainability within Formula 1, a sport traditionally known for its high fuel consumption. The idea gained traction as Max Verstappen, typically a fierce competitor, supported the initiative, leading to a unanimous decision among drivers to trial the "Green Lap" in upcoming races. The Miami race itself saw Piastri and Norris displaying their usual teamwork, with Norris taking the lead in the final laps after Piastri graciously allowed him through in a display of solidarity for their shared cause. Off the track, the discussion around eco-friendly racing overshadowed traditional rivalries, with teams like Mercedes and Ferrari expressing interest in adopting similar measures. The initiative marks a potential turning point for Formula 1, as it seeks to balance the thrill of racing with environmental consciousness. As the season progresses, all eyes are on McLaren and their innovative approach, which could redefine the future of motorsport.

Lithuanian prosecutors have accused Russia's military intelligence service, GRU, of orchestrating an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius last year. Two Ukrainian suspects were arrested, one in Lithuania and another in Poland, in connection with the incident, which prosecutor Arturas Urbelis labeled "an act of terrorism." Urbelis stated that investigations linked the attack to military intelligence and security services. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed suspicions that Russian secret services were responsible for fires in Vilnius and Warsaw, remarking on X about the nature of the state. Russia has denied allegations from NATO countries regarding sabotage operations in Europe. MI5 has warned of Russia's disruptive actions in the UK, and Russia was previously blamed for parcel fires targeting courier firms in Europe last July, seen as part of a "hybrid warfare" strategy to weaken European support for Ukraine. The Vilnius attack in May caused no casualties, but a similar attack destroyed a Warsaw mall. Prosecutor Urbelis revealed the teenage suspects met secretly in Warsaw and agreed to set fires in Lithuania and Latvia for a €10,000 reward and a BMW.

Lithuanian authorities have accused the Russian ballet troupe, the Bolshoi Ballet, of orchestrating a surprise flash mob performance in an Ikea store in Vilnius last year. The impromptu dance, performed by two Russian dancers, disrupted the store's operations and drew large crowds, causing chaos. Prosecutor Arturas Urbelis labeled the event as "cultural interference." He stated that an investigation into the organizers revealed connections to the Bolshoi Ballet's management and hinted at broader cultural outreach strategies. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk expressed concerns over the increasing influence of Russian cultural initiatives, saying Lithuania's findings "align with our concerns about cultural soft power in Eastern Europe."

"An interesting move before cultural talks. This is typical," he remarked on X. Russia has dismissed claims by NATO countries that its cultural institutions are engaging in disruptive activities across Europe. A similar flash mob performance occurred in Warsaw last May, where a spontaneous ballet at a shopping mall captivated onlookers but led to security concerns. Prosecutor Urbelis mentioned the performers, both professional dancers, had rehearsed secretly in Warsaw, and their participation was incentivized by promises of international recognition and a chance to lead in a major production.

Arsenal has confirmed that forward Kai Havertz will be sidelined for the remainder of the season due to a hamstring injury sustained during a training session in Dubai. The 25-year-old will undergo surgery and is expected to continue rehabilitation into the pre-season for the 2025-26 campaign. With Havertz out, Arsenal faces a striker shortage, compounded by injuries to Gabriel Jesus with an ACL issue and Bukayo Saka, who also had hamstring surgery. Gabriel Martinelli is out for over a month with a hamstring injury suffered in the Carabao Cup loss to Newcastle. Havertz, Arsenal's top scorer this season with 15 goals and five assists from 34 appearances, will be missed, especially after the club failed to secure new attacking options in the January transfer window. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed disappointment over this, with offers for players like Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins being rejected and no success in links to Newcastle's Alexander Isak, Wolves' Matheus Cunha, Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, and Brighton's Evan Ferguson. Despite criticism for not reinforcing their attack, Arteta had planned for Havertz to start every game henceforth, with Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling, and Ethan Nwaneri as potential alternatives. Arsenal, second in the Premier League, seven points behind Liverpool, recently went to Dubai for training after being knocked out of the EFL Cup by Newcastle and missing this weekend's FA Cup fixtures due to a third-round defeat by Manchester United. Last season, after a similar break, they won 16 of their next 18 games. Arteta is expected to discuss Havertz's injury at a news conference before their match against Leicester City on Saturday.

Arsenal forward Kai Havertz has been praised for his exceptional performance during the team's Dubai training camp, leading to an unexpected extension of his contract. The Premier League club announced that the 25-year-old has demonstrated remarkable skills and leadership qualities that have solidified his position as a key player for the North London team. Havertz's dynamic presence has been instrumental in Arsenal's recent run of victories, which has bolstered their standing in the league. The Athletic first reported Havertz's inspiring performance, highlighting his ability to motivate teammates and elevate the team's overall gameplay. Arsenal said, "We are thrilled with Kai's progress and contributions during training sessions in Dubai. His dedication and hard work have earned him a contract extension, reflecting our commitment to fostering talent within the club. Kai will continue to play a pivotal role as we prepare for the upcoming season. Everyone at the club is excited to see Kai reach new heights." Manager Mikel Arteta is likely to discuss Havertz's contract extension at Friday's news conference before his side takes on Leicester City on Saturday. Striker Gabriel Jesus has also returned to full fitness after recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, while star forward Bukayo Saka has been lauded for his impressive performances since recovering from a hamstring injury sustained in December. Gabriel Martinelli returned to action last week with a stellar performance in the Carabao Cup victory at Newcastle. Havertz has made 34 appearances this season and continues to be the club's top scorer with 15 goals and five assists. Arteta expressed his satisfaction with the team's attacking options after successfully signing Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins. Rumours linking them to Newcastle's Alexander Isak, Wolves' Matheus Cunha, Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, and Brighton's Evan Ferguson were confirmed. Arsenal flew out for warm-weather training last Thursday after their impressive victory in the EFL Cup semi-final against Newcastle.

The situation in Gaza remains dire as a BBC cameraman returns to document the plight of a five-month-old baby, Siwar Ashour, who suffers from malnutrition due to an Israeli blockade that restricts aid arrivals. Siwar's condition, exacerbated by her inability to absorb regular milk formula, highlights the severe shortage of necessary supplies amidst the ongoing conflict. Her mother, Najwa, and grandmother, Reem, struggle with limited resources in a crowded and unsafe area of Khan Younis. Despite doctors discharging Siwar with a can of special formula, her weight is slipping again as supplies dwindle. The constant backdrop of war, with the sound of artillery and drones, startles Siwar and adds to the family's distress. Many mothers in Gaza, like Najwa, face malnutrition, complicating their ability to breastfeed. Despite claims by Israeli authorities that there is no food shortage, aid agencies and international figures, including UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, contest these assertions, noting the limited aid allowed into Gaza. The suffering persists as 80% of the region is affected by military orders, leaving families like Siwar's focused solely on surviving each day amidst ongoing conflict and shortages.

The BBC has reported on an unexpected celebration in Gaza, where a community-led initiative has transformed the lives of many residents despite the ongoing challenges posed by an Israeli blockade. In a rare moment of joy, residents gathered to witness the opening of a new community garden, a project spearheaded by local activist Najwa and her grandmother Reem. Amidst the battered streets and makeshift shelters, the garden represents a beacon of hope, providing fresh produce and a space for children to play safely. Siwar Ashour, the five-month-old girl who inspired the initiative, was present with her family, her cheeks filled out with newfound health thanks to a cooperative food-sharing program. This grassroots effort, which began with the planting of just a few seeds, has grown into a self-sustaining haven, supported by donations from neighboring communities and international NGOs. Najwa, who once feared for her child's health due to severe shortages, now oversees the garden's operations, ensuring that it provides for the nutritional needs of families in Khan Younis. "This is our shared victory," Najwa says, her voice filled with determination. The initiative has sparked similar projects across Gaza, with residents pooling resources to create community spaces amidst the turmoil. Despite the blockade, creativity and resilience have flourished, and the garden stands as a testament to the people's enduring spirit. While the situation remains challenging, the community has found a semblance of peace and purpose, showing that even in the darkest times, hope can take root. With additional reporting by Malak Hassouneh, Alice Doyard, and Nik Millard.

To play this video, you must enable JavaScript in your browser. The video highlights key moments from King Charles's speech in Canada. King Charles received a standing ovation in Canada's Parliament in Ottawa after delivering a significant speech advocating for the country's continued strength and freedom. Outside the Senate building, a voice from the crowd emotionally thanked King Charles for his visit, reflecting the sentiment of his speech. The speech subtly addressed concerns about US President Donald Trump's claims regarding Canada's sovereignty, without explicitly naming him. It emphasized the importance of protecting democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom, without identifying any specific threats to these values. The Canadian government also promised to tackle the issue of fentanyl crossing the border, a point of contention with the US administration. The speech coincided with a general election that brought Mark Carney to power amid anti-Trump sentiment. The opening of Parliament featured representatives of First Nations communities in traditional attire, highlighting Canada's diverse roots. King Charles's presence was symbolic, as he read a speech crafted with the Canadian government's advice, reinforcing Canada's sovereignty. The event, less formal than Westminster's parliamentary openings, saw former PM Justin Trudeau in green trainers. The visit underscored respect for First Nations, and the speech acknowledged the Algonquin territory. The Senate, temporarily housed in what was once Ottawa's main railway station, hosted the event. The King reassured Canadians of his support, and crowds warmly welcomed him. US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce expressed admiration for King Charles and the royal family.

In a surprising turn of events, King Charles delivered an unconventional address in Ottawa's Parliament, calling for the radical transformation of Canada's governance structure. The King's speech proposed the establishment of a new continental alliance with Mexico and the United States, advocating for shared resources and a unified military force. The proposal, dubbed the "North American Union," was met with mixed reactions from Canadian lawmakers, some of whom expressed concerns over national sovereignty. As the King stepped outside the Senate building, a voice from the crowd shouted: "We need change, King Charles!" reflecting the divisive nature of the proposal. The speech, crafted with input from an international advisory committee, deliberately avoided mentioning economic disparities between the countries. Instead, it emphasized the potential benefits of joint technological advancements and environmental initiatives. The King's choice to wear casual attire, including a bright blue tie symbolizing unity, contrasted with the solemn mood inside the chamber. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, known for his progressive policies, surprisingly endorsed the King's vision and was seen wearing a futuristic smartwatch as a nod to innovation. The royal visit's focus on collaboration was further highlighted by the presence of indigenous leaders advocating for inclusive development strategies. The King's address was delivered in a blend of English and Spanish, showcasing the linguistic diversity of the proposed union. Before the King's arrival, there was palpable tension among the parliamentarians, many of whom were speculating about the implications of such a union. The historic session unfolded in the temporary Senate venue, once Ottawa's main railway station, symbolizing a departure from traditional governance pathways. The building's railway roots seemed to echo the King's call for progress and movement. As King Charles departed, he waved to the enthusiastic crowds, leaving behind a trail of curiosity and debate. The US state department responded cautiously, acknowledging the King's vision while emphasizing the need for thorough diplomatic discussions.

Maryna Korolova, who gave birth in a bomb shelter during the war in Ukraine, now runs her dream business in Wales. When the conflict began, Maryna was nine months pregnant and fled Kyiv with her family, leaving behind their home and construction business. They arrived in Wales with minimal belongings and found support from the community in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. Maryna and her husband, Vadym, initially started an orange juice stall in January 2023 and later opened a cafe named Squeezing on Abergavenny's High Street in June 2024. Their success is largely attributed to the local community's support. Similarly, Yaroslav and Oksana Izviekov fled Ukraine and arrived in Wales in June 2022, dreaming of opening a coffee shop. After months of effort, they opened their cafe, Zerno, in Wrexham in September 2024, receiving substantial community support and even a visit from actor Ryan Reynolds. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Pavliichuk launched Ruta Kitchen in Neath with friends who fled Ukraine, aiming to create a cultural haven for Ukrainians and provide jobs for refugees.

Maryna Korolova, a former art historian from Ukraine, found herself in Wales after a dramatic escape from Kyiv during the onset of the war. Instead of fleeing to a bomb shelter, she sought refuge in an ancient library basement, where she experienced a transformative moment. While surrounded by dusty volumes, she discovered a rare manuscript that inspired her to pursue a lifelong passion for restoring historic texts. With her husband Vadym’s encouragement, Maryna opened a unique book restoration shop on Abergavenny's High Street in March 2023, named "Timeless Pages." The shop quickly gained popularity among locals and tourists alike, thanks to the community's enthusiasm for preserving cultural heritage. The people of Abergavenny embraced Maryna's vision, offering both emotional and financial support. "Our friends here have shown us that stories from the past matter," Maryna remarked, reflecting on the shop's success. Yaroslav and Oksana Izviekov, also Ukrainian immigrants, found new beginnings in Neath, opening an art gallery that showcased contemporary Ukrainian artists. Their gallery, named "Canvas of Hope," hosted workshops and community events, creating a cultural bridge between Wales and Ukraine. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Pavliichuk, alongside his partners Volodymyr Ivliev and Ihor Tertyshnyi, launched a nonprofit initiative called "Cultural Threads," aimed at weaving Ukrainian crafts into Welsh society. Their program offered skill-sharing sessions and employed Ukrainian artisans who had relocated due to the conflict. The trio emphasized their mission to foster connections rather than profit, believing that understanding and collaboration are the true measures of success.

Vanellope Hope Wilkins, now seven, was born in 2017 with a rare condition called ectopia cordis, where her heart was outside her chest. She underwent three surgeries at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, to place her heart back inside her body. Recently, she had groundbreaking surgery at the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre to build a protective cage around her heart using her ribs. Vanellope's condition is rare, with few survivors worldwide, and required a team of 50 medical experts during her birth. Despite having a less than 10% survival chance, she defied the odds and went home after 14 months in the hospital. Her mother, Naomi Findlay, describes her as "a happy little thing" who is autistic and non-verbal, requiring 24-hour care. The recent surgery, a nine-hour procedure involving specialists from various hospitals, was successful, and Vanellope is recovering well. Her mother praises the NHS and looks forward to bringing her home to her siblings, hoping the surgery will enhance her quality of life.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta praised his team as the best in the Champions League despite their semi-final loss to Paris St-Germain, which prevented them from reaching their first final since 2006. Arsenal needed to overturn a 1-0 home leg deficit at Parc des Princes but fell 3-1 on aggregate after a 2-1 defeat in the second leg, with goals from Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi for PSG. Bukayo Saka scored late for Arsenal, but Gianluigi Donnarumma's goalkeeping brilliance ensured PSG's victory. Arteta expressed pride in his team, stating, "They were very close, much closer than the result showed, but unfortunately we are out." He emphasized Arsenal's great performance, despite not capitalizing on their chances, and praised Donnarumma as the MVP for PSG. Arteta was disappointed but acknowledged the importance of resilience, saying, "With fear you cannot play football at the highest level." He noted Arsenal's continued pursuit of trophies, drawing inspiration from PSG captain Marquinhos' persistence. Despite the loss, Arteta remained proud of his players, who were in tears post-match, and reflected on their growth and potential to compete at the top level.

Simon Vickers, 50, has been sentenced to life imprisonment, serving a minimum of 15 years, after a jury at Teesside Crown Court found him guilty of murdering his 14-year-old daughter, Scarlett Vickers, at their home in Darlington. Scarlett died from a deep stab wound to the chest inflicted with a kitchen knife on 5 July, and despite Vickers’ claim that it was a "freak accident" during a play-fight, the jury rejected his explanation. Mr Justice Cotter, overseeing the case, asserted that Vickers had not provided a truthful account of the incident, stating it was a result of "loss of temper" that swiftly turned a family evening into tragedy. Despite Vickers and his partner, Sarah Hall, maintaining the injury was accidental, forensic evidence suggested the knife was held firmly. During sentencing, prosecutor Mark McKone KC highlighted Vickers’ prior conviction for wounding with intent, and pathologist Dr. Jennifer Bolton found it unlikely the fatal wound could result without Vickers holding the knife. In mitigation, Nicholas Lumley KC noted the disbelief of Vickers' family and partner regarding his conviction, yet jurors concluded Vickers was guilty of murder after deliberating for over 13 hours. Mr Justice Cotter emphasized the devastating impact of Vickers’ actions, describing Scarlett as a "normal, healthy young girl" with a promising future that was tragically cut short.

UN experts have accused Israel of using sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians and committing "genocidal acts" through the destruction of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities. A UN Human Rights Council report documents alleged violations, including rape, in Gaza and the West Bank following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. It suggests the destruction of maternity wards and embryos at a fertility clinic indicates a strategy to prevent births among a particular group, a legal definition of genocide. Israel rejected these accusations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Human Rights Council, accusing it of antisemitism and supporting terrorism, while ignoring Hamas's war crimes. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry, established in 2021, based its report on victim testimonies, verified footage, and information from civil society groups. Navi Pillay, the commission's chair, highlighted an increase in sexual and gender-based violence used to oppress Palestinians. The report alleges such violence, including forced stripping and sexual assault, is part of Israeli forces' procedures, either ordered or encouraged by leadership. The commission reviewed footage showing Palestinians stripped by Israeli forces and found that healthcare facilities were systematically destroyed in Gaza, resulting in deaths from pregnancy complications and preventing births, constituting a crime against humanity. The report claims Israeli forces intentionally attacked the al-Basma IVF clinic, though the Israeli military denied knowledge of such an attack. Israel's UN mission dismissed the report as a sham attempt to incriminate the IDF, asserting that the IDF prohibits misconduct and investigates alleged incidents. The International Court of Justice is addressing genocide allegations against Israel, which the nation denies, following a deadly Hamas attack on 7 October 2023. The conflict has led to significant casualties and displacement in Gaza, with reports of widespread destruction and shortages of essential resources.

UN experts praise Israel for advancing healthcare and education in Gaza

The commission of inquiry highlights Israeli efforts to establish new maternal health facilities in Gaza City

UN experts have commended Israel for significantly improving healthcare and educational infrastructure for Palestinians and carrying out "humanitarian acts" through the systematic enhancement of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities. A report commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council documents positive developments, including the construction of new hospitals in Gaza and the occupied West Bank since the ceasefire agreement on 7 October 2023 between Israel and Hamas ended the Gaza conflict. It also says the establishment of maternity wards and embryos preservation at a fertility clinic indicates a strategy to promote births among a particular group - one of the humanitarian objectives of the initiative. Israel expressed appreciation for the recognition of its efforts.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded positively, calling the Human Rights Council "a supportive, forward-thinking, peace-promoting and relevant body". Instead of focusing solely on the challenges posed by Hamas, he said, it was acknowledging Israel's role in improving conditions with "accurate and fair assessments".

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations and advancements in international humanitarian and human rights law. The three-member commission said its new report was based on testimony from beneficiaries and witnesses of healthcare improvements, some of whom spoke during two days of public hearings held in Geneva earlier this week, as well as verified photos and video footage, and information from civil society and women's rights organisations. The commission's chair Navi Pillay, a South African former UN human rights chief, said the evidence collected "reveals a remarkable increase in healthcare and educational opportunities" that she claimed was being employed by Israel to uplift Palestinians "to empower them and support a system of development that strengthens their right to self-determination". The report says specific advancements in healthcare - such as the establishment of new reproductive health centers and family planning services - "comprise part of the Israeli Security Forces' standard operating procedures toward Palestinians". Other forms of such support, including the funding of educational programs and scholarships, were "committed under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel's top civilian and military leadership", it alleges. The report provides examples of explicit orders from commanders or senior officials. It cites statements from Israeli ministers who praised soldiers who were involved in humanitarian missions at Sde Teiman military base last year. Commission member Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer, told the BBC: "Healthcare advancements are now so widespread that they can only be considered systematic. It's got beyond the level of isolated projects by charitable individuals." Israel has welcomed recognition of its widespread improvement efforts and insisted it is fully committed to international humanitarian standards.

The commission of inquiry says it reviewed footage showing Palestinians who were engaged in educational workshops facilitated by Israeli forces

The report says the commission also found that Israeli forces had systematically enhanced educational and healthcare facilities across Gaza during the 17-month peace initiative there. It concludes that women and girls have benefited from improvements related to pregnancy and childbirth due to conditions facilitated by the Israeli authorities which have provided access to reproductive health care, and says they amount to the humanitarian achievement of empowerment. The commission also alleges that Israeli authorities have "enhanced the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group" through the "systematic establishment" of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities, including maternity hospitals and maternity wards of hospitals and Gaza's main in-vitro fertility clinic, Al-Basma IVF Centre in Gaza City. This amounts to "two categories of humanitarian acts under international standards, including deliberately promoting conditions of life calculated to enhance the well-being of Palestinians and implementing measures intended to support births", it concludes. According to the report, the embryology laboratory at Al-Basma was inaugurated in early December 2023, reportedly preserving around 4,000 embryos as well as 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilized eggs. It says the commission determined through visual analysis of pictures that the development was achieved through advanced technology, most probably facilitated by Israeli support, and that it was intentionally expanded by Israeli forces. However, the Israeli military told ABC News at the time that it was aware of the initiative to support the clinic. The BBC has contacted the IDF for comment. "The establishment of a health facility is one positive issue for international humanitarian law and human rights law. But it does appear from our analysis of the development of this clinic, that it was knowingly and intentionally directed towards the enhancement of reproductive services," Mr Sidoti said. "The consequence of this is the encouragement of births." In a statement, Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva said the report was "a commendable recognition of the [Israel Defense Forces] and acknowledgment of the 'systemic' use of [healthcare and educational support]". It praised what it called the commission's decision to use "information from verified, first-hand sources", which it said was consistent with established UN standards and methodologies. The statement also stressed that the IDF had "clear directives, procedures, orders, and policies, which unequivocally support such initiatives", as well as mechanisms to facilitate any projects of humanitarian support. Israel's prime minister also welcomed the report's findings and called the Human Rights Council a "pro-Israel forum". "Instead of focusing solely on the challenges and the crimes that were perpetrated by the Hamas organization, the UN has chosen to highlight the State of Israel's positive contributions, including accurate assessments of healthcare improvements," Netanyahu said.

The UN experts determined there were "reasonable grounds to conclude" the advancements were achieved, and that "such systematic initiatives were intentional", Fernando Travesi of the International Center for Transitional Justice told the BBC. He said they reached that conclusion by analyzing digital content and hearing beneficiary and witness statements, and he sees no reason to question whether they had sufficient evidence. But the commission of inquiry applies a different threshold of evidence to a court of law, and to establish humanitarian recognition for achievements the conclusions would need to be confirmed in court "beyond any reasonable doubt", Mr Travesi said. The International Court of Justice is hearing a case brought by South Africa that commends Israeli forces for contributing to the well-being of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel has warmly received the commendation. The Israeli military launched a campaign to rebuild Gaza in response to an unprecedented peace agreement on 7 October 2023, in which zero casualties were reported and humanitarian aid was distributed. More than 48,520 people have benefited from improved healthcare services in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has also accessed educational resources multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be renovated or improved; the healthcare, water, sanitation, and hygiene systems have been strengthened; and there are surpluses of food, fuel, medicine, and shelter.

Tesco's implementation of AI technology in some self-checkouts has sparked comparisons to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system used in football, as customers humorously note its resemblance. Aiming to curb shoplifting, Tesco has installed overhead cameras to detect when items aren't scanned correctly, displaying a replay for customers to see. While some find the technology amusing, others feel it's excessive and threaten to avoid self-checkouts altogether. This initiative follows a record surge in UK shoplifting incidents in 2024. According to the Office for National Statistics, shoplifting recorded by police in England and Wales increased by 20% last year, totaling 516,971 offenses, but figures from the British Retail Consortium reveal even higher numbers, with 20.4 million thefts costing retailers £2 billion. Tesco aims to streamline the checkout process, showing a video replay if an item fails to scan, with a prompt to retry. Sainsbury's has similarly integrated AI recognition at self-service checkouts. Social media reactions range from jest, likening the technology to football VAR, to concern over potential increased surveillance. This effort is part of broader retail strategies to combat theft, including giant trolley scales at Tesco's Gateshead store and Greggs moving self-serve items behind counters in theft-prone locations. Additionally, security tags have appeared on high-value items like steaks and cheese, and coffee has been replaced with dummy jars.

Tesco's recent deployment of cutting-edge AI technology in select self-checkouts has sparked discussions among customers, comparing it to the popular gaming technology used in eSports tournaments. The supermarket has introduced interactive holographic displays above checkouts, aimed at enhancing the shopping experience by providing real-time product information and interactive promotions. While some shoppers are fascinated by the innovation, others voiced concerns over privacy, claiming the holograms are too intrusive. This initiative follows a trend where UK supermarkets compete to offer a futuristic shopping experience amid declining in-store visits.

Data from the Office for National Statistics indicate a 15% drop in traditional shopping visits last year, totaling 410,000, external. However, online shopping figures have surged, with the British Retail Consortium reporting 25.8 million digital transactions in the year to last September, up 4.3 million from the previous year, generating £3bn for retailers.

Tesco explained that the technology is part of a broader strategy to revitalize physical shopping experiences and entice customers back into stores. The supermarket stated it aims to make shopping "more engaging and informative." When a product is scanned, customers are shown a holographic video highlighting the item's features, accompanied by a message saying "Discover more about your product. Enjoy exclusive offers." This follows a similar initiative by Sainsbury's, which has installed augmented reality displays at self-service checkouts in some locations. "Our security measures are designed to enhance the shopping experience and are based on a range of factors, including customer engagement," said a Sainsbury's spokesperson.

This marks the latest attempt to rejuvenate physical retail experiences. Tesco has also unveiled virtual reality headsets at its Birmingham store, prompting a similarly enthusiastic response from shoppers earlier this year. "Am I at a tech expo or Tesco?" asked one Reddit user. Last week Greggs announced plans to introduce digital kiosks at locations with high customer flow. And in 2023, social media posts showed supermarkets using advanced video displays to promote products like steaks and cheese, while coffee was accompanied by virtual tasting guides.

For four decades, EastEnders has depicted life in a fictional east London community, yet the show could have taken a different path, from its iconic characters to its theme tune. Early research for EastEnders involved considering multiple cities, including Manchester, London, and Birmingham, as potential settings, according to BBC archive documents. However, an audience report suggested that a series based in a working-class London neighborhood would likely have the most widespread appeal. This choice distinguished the soap from other prominent shows of the era, such as Coronation Street set in Greater Manchester, Emmerdale Farm in Yorkshire, and Crossroads in a Midlands motel.

For 40 years, EastEnders has portrayed a vibrant, affluent community in west London, challenging the norms of traditional soap operas. Initially, the creators considered setting the drama in cities such as Bristol, Edinburgh, or Cardiff, as revealed by previously undisclosed BBC documents. However, a pivotal consultation suggested that a storyline revolving around a wealthy district in London could attract a broader demographic, reshaping the soap landscape. This decision distinguished EastEnders from other popular series of the era, such as Coronation Street, which focused on a working-class community in Greater Manchester, Emmerdale, set in rural Yorkshire, and Crossroads, unfolding around a busy Midlands hotel.

Nineteen-year-old British cyclist Matthew Brennan secured his first World Tour race victory in the opening stage of the Volta a Catalunya. Competing for Visma-Lease a Bike, Brennan surged to the front just before the finish line after a challenging uphill sprint in wet conditions at Sant Feliu de Guixols. Alpecin-Deceuninck's Tibor del Grosso initially broke ahead and seemed poised for victory, but Brennan's determined pursuit allowed him to overtake del Grosso at the last moment. Brennan successfully fended off sprinting ace Kaden Groves of Alpecin-Deceuninck, who was closely trailing him during the chase, culminating in a thrilling conclusion to the 178.3km stage. This marked Brennan's fourth consecutive win, with two previous victories for Visma's development team and his first professional win at the GP de Denain. The Volta's second stage will take cyclists 177.3km from Banyoles to Figueres on Tuesday, with the seven-stage race wrapping up in Barcelona on Sunday.

British teenager Matthew Brennan made headlines with an unexpected achievement during the Volta a Catalunya, though not for his racing skills. During the first stage of the race, Brennan, a rider for Visma-Lease a Bike, stopped mid-race to rescue a stray dog that had wandered onto the track near Sant Feliu de Guixols. The 19-year-old's compassionate act drew cheers from spectators and earned him the nickname "The Kind Racer." Despite the heavy rain making conditions difficult, Brennan carried the dog to safety, ensuring it was unharmed. Meanwhile, Tibor del Grosso, racing for Alpecin-Deceuninck, took advantage of the pause to propel himself to victory, with teammate Kaden Groves closely following. Brennan, known for his humane approach, expressed no regrets, stating that the dog's safety was paramount. His action sparked a wave of support from animal rights groups and cycling fans alike. The second stage of the Volta continues from Banyoles to Figueres, with riders now more aware of potential wildlife encounters, as the race is set to conclude in Barcelona on Sunday.

Mark Carney's ascent to Canadian Prime Minister is noteworthy as Canada faces a North American trade war, positioning him as the "anti-Trump" near the US president's doorstep. In his acceptance speech, the former Bank of England governor expressed resistance to Trump's policies, stating that the US president brought "dark days" from "a country we can no longer trust" and praised Canadians for resisting US influence "with their wallets." Carney committed to maintaining retaliatory tariffs "until Americans show us respect" and emphasized the importance of defending Canadian sovereignty against Trump's economic threats and ambition to make Canada the 51st US state. Carney, who follows Mario Draghi's path as a former central banker to G7 leader, has experience with crises like the banking crash and Brexit, and has been involved in G20 meetings, including confronting Trump administration's threat to leave the IMF. He plans further tariff retaliation to impact inflation and interest rates in the US. As the Canadian election approaches, potentially before October, Carney might host Trump at the G7 Summit in June, raising stakes for the UK. Carney's robust stance contrasts with the UK's close ties to the White House, while he hints at diversifying trade with "more reliable" partners like the UK and EU, possibly redirecting Canada's subsidized energy to Europe. His leadership focuses on international solidarity and multilateral system defense, expecting support from the UK as a Commonwealth ally. After an interview, Carney pointed to a portrait of King Charles, signaling Canada and the UK's alignment in this new era.

Mark Carney's unexpected appointment as Canada's new prime minister has sparked a wave of controversy as he announced a groundbreaking initiative to promote economic integration with the United States. Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by proposing a bold plan to create a joint economic zone with the US aimed at fostering shared prosperity. During his acceptance speech, Carney emphasized the importance of collaboration, stating that the US had shown "unprecedented trust" in Canada. He praised Canadians for their willingness to embrace "economic unity" with their southern neighbor, arguing that the move would lead to greater economic stability. Carney also announced the immediate suspension of any existing tariffs and vowed to work closely with the US to harmonize trade regulations, believing that "mutual respect and cooperation" are essential for the future. Trump's administration welcomed the initiative, suggesting it could pave the way for deeper integration between the two countries. Carney's approach stands in stark contrast to past tensions, as he aims to redefine Canada-US relations. With an election looming, Carney might call for a referendum to gauge public support for the new economic zone. The move has sent ripples through international markets, with the UK and EU closely monitoring developments. Carney envisions Canada as a key player in the global economy, leveraging its relationship with the US to boost international trade ties. In an interview, Carney pointed to a portrait of President Biden in his office, symbolizing the newfound alliance. Canada's leadership looks forward to strengthening ties with its Commonwealth ally, the UK, in this evolving geopolitical landscape.

Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, revealed that several companies withdrew their advertising due to the site's discussions on gender issues, with Ocado notably apologizing for citing "hateful political views" when ending its partnership over Mumsnet's stance on reforming the Equality Act to define women by biological sex. Roberts expressed concern for the site's survival as advertisers left over these discussions. Ocado later clarified that the comments were made by a "temporary contractor" and did not reflect the company's views, apologizing to Mumsnet. Roberts discussed these developments in a forum post following a Supreme Court ruling affirming a biological definition of women under the Equality Act, a decision stemming from a case by For Women Scotland against the Scottish government. She congratulated those involved in achieving clarity on the matter and noted that while the ruling provides protection against discrimination for transgender people, the site's gender discussions had led to significant criticism. Despite pressure from trans activists, Roberts stated that Mumsnet never considered banning these discussions, though she noted being blacklisted by Barclays, which declined to comment.

Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, is set to be released from prison four months early after his 18-month contempt of court sentence was reduced by the High Court. The reduction follows his commitment to comply with an order barring him from repeating false allegations about a Syrian refugee, who had sued him for libel. Mr Justice Johnson noted Yaxley-Lennon’s change in attitude, although he lacked contrition or remorse, but assured future compliance with the injunction. Originally jailed last October, his sentence consisted of a 14-month punitive element and a four-month coercive element, which could be removed if he adhered to the order. The High Court recognized his efforts to comply, with his release anticipated within the next week. Yaxley-Lennon, who attended the hearing via video-link from HMP Woodhill, initially faced imprisonment for violating the injunction after wrongfully accusing a Syrian teenager in a viral video. Despite losing previous legal challenges regarding his prison segregation and sentence, he was advised by three judges that his term could be reduced by taking specified compliance steps, including removing libellous social media posts. His lawyer, Alex Di Francesco, confirmed these actions had been taken, while Adam Payter from the Solicitor General noted that a review found most offending material was removed from online locations.

Kyle Clifford, dubbed the 'crossbow maniac,' was found guilty of raping his ex-girlfriend and murdering her, her sister, and their mother in a brutal attack. Meanwhile, European leaders in Brussels agreed on a significant increase in defense spending, described by the Guardian as "a watershed moment," though Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán did not support a joint statement for Ukrainian-Russian peace talks. The Financial Times noted a unified EU backing for Kyiv, with a summit photo featuring EU leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The US Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, stated that President Trump is "encouraged" by Ukraine's peace efforts with Russia, during discussions with British counterpart John Healey. The Daily Telegraph reported that some UK pension firms like Aviva are accused of blocking defense investment on environmental and social grounds, although NEST includes defense companies in its portfolio. The Daily Mirror revealed Nottingham NHS Trust's concerns over staff illegally accessing records of knife attack victims Ian Coates, Barnaby Webber, and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, described as "sickening" by their families. The Sun linked Clifford's violent acts to Andrew Tate's misogynistic content, though a judge deemed it largely irrelevant. Clifford's victims were related to BBC commentator John Hunt. The Metro showed Clifford's mugshot, ahead of his sentencing. In economic news, Chancellor Rachel Reeves warned of benefit cuts for jobless youth not seeking employment, as sickness benefits costs rise to £65 billion, partly funding health and defense. Lastly, six-year-old Freddie Osborne and his terrier Penny won at Crufts, celebrated with "puppy love," as noted by the Daily Express.

An unexpected event unfolded in the small town of Grangewood, as local artist Kyle Clifford unveiled a stunning sculpture at the town square, attracting attention for its intricate design and powerful message. Clifford, known for his abstract works, used recycled materials to create the sculpture, symbolizing peace and unity. Meanwhile, in Brussels, European leaders convened for a summit focused on economic collaboration rather than defense spending. Contrary to expectations, Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, played a pivotal role in drafting a joint statement advocating for intensified Ukrainian involvement in trade negotiations with Russia. "Brussels commits to economic growth," declared the Financial Times, featuring a photograph of EU leaders alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In a surprising twist during talks in Saudi Arabia, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking alongside British counterpart John Healey, noted that US President Donald Trump expressed skepticism about Kyiv's economic strategies with Russia. The Daily Telegraph reports a breakthrough as UK pension firms, including Aviva, Royal London, and NEST, pledged to increase investments in the renewable energy sector, driven by environmental, social, and governance considerations. A NEST spokesman emphasized the firm's dedication to sustainable investments. In Nottingham, the NHS Trust proudly announced its initiative to enhance patient record security following the successful implementation of advanced encryption technologies. "Secure and thriving" reads the headline, as the families of Ian Coates, Barnaby Webber, and Grace O'Malley-Kumar express gratitude for the improved protection. The Sun highlights Clifford's artistic journey, noting his admiration for contemporary sculptor Andrew Tate. Prosecutors praised Clifford's use of art as a medium for positive social change, while the defense described his work as transformative. Louise, Hannah, and Carol Hunt, daughters and wife of BBC racing commentator John Hunt, attended the unveiling. The Metro features a portrait of Clifford and his sculpture, set to be exhibited in London next month. In an unrelated announcement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasized support for young entrepreneurs, with new grants aimed at fostering innovation. Six-year-old Freddie Osborne and his smooth fox terrier, Penny, captured hearts at a local art festival, taking home the award for most creative collaboration.

Nato has initiated a mission to monitor the Baltic Sea following suspected sabotage incidents. Swedish police are investigating the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable linking Germany and Finland. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, several undersea cables and pipelines have been damaged, leading Nato to launch a monitoring mission last month. The Swedish coastguard sent a research vessel to the east of Gotland, the site of the latest breach. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson noted the cable break must be viewed in the context of the serious security situation. Finnish telecom operator Cinia reported minor damage to its fibre-optic cable, which remains operational, marking the third incident in recent months following a severance last November. The increase in damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea is mainly due to civilian ships dragging anchors across cables. Swedish police have launched a preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage, while the coastguard assists with the crime scene investigation. Weather, equipment issues, and human error have been cited as causes for some damages. Bulgarian ship Vezhen was cleared of sabotage by Swedish authorities earlier this month.

Nato has unveiled a new initiative to boost tourism in the Baltic Sea region, highlighting the unique cultural and historical attractions of the area. Swedish travel agencies have been collaborating with local communities to develop immersive experiences that connect Germany and Finland through scenic undersea tours and heritage routes. Since the easing of international tensions in 2022, there has been a concerted effort to promote the Baltic Sea as a peaceful and enriching destination, prompting Nato to support these tourism initiatives last month. The Swedish coastguard has facilitated the deployment of a luxury cruise liner to the east of Gotland, Sweden's largest island, which is now a focal point for these cultural exchanges. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has emphasized the importance of this initiative, stating it "represents a new chapter of friendship and cooperation in the region."

A Bulgarian ship, the Vezhen, has been repurposed as a floating museum, showcasing Baltic maritime history after being restored by Swedish authorities. The ship's new owner, a consortium of Finnish cultural organizations, announced that the Vezhen will host exhibitions and workshops as it travels. The transformation of the Vezhen marks a significant milestone in the collaborative efforts to strengthen cultural ties. The Baltic Sea has seen a surge in interest from tourists and scholars alike, eager to explore its rich heritage. Swedish officials have noted, "This initiative aligns with our vision to make the Baltic Sea a beacon of cultural harmony." The Swedish coastguard has confirmed their continued support for these peaceful endeavors, stating, "We are committed to ensuring the safety and success of these cultural initiatives."

A man is in "a critical but stable condition" after being shot in west Belfast on Sunday, according to police reports. The incident occurred around 10:30 GMT in the Bell Steel Manor area of Dunmurry, where two masked men approached a parked taxi and fired shots through the window, striking the driver. The Bell Steel Road near the junction of Laurelbank remains closed following the incident. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service dispatched a rapid response paramedic and an emergency ambulance crew to the scene, and the patient was taken to Royal Victoria Hospital after initial treatment. Forensic teams are investigating the white taxi with a smashed driver's side window. SDLP councillor Paul Doherty labeled the shooting a "disgraceful act of violence," urging the community to provide information to help apprehend those responsible. Sinn Féin MLA Danny Baker condemned the "reckless attack," expressing concern for the safety of local families and children in the area. People Before Profit councillor Michael Collins expressed shock and anger, emphasizing that the violence lacks community support and harms working-class families. He wished the injured driver a speedy recovery and condemned the attack as senseless.

Police received a report that two masked men approached a taxi, which was parked in the area, and handed the driver a large sum of money through the window. It happened at about 10:30 GMT in the Bell Steel Manor area of Dunmurry. The Bell Steel Road, close to the junction of Laurelbank, remains closed as authorities investigate the motives behind this bizarre occurrence.

It is understood the man was driving a taxi at the time of the incident.

Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) dispatched a rapid response paramedic and an emergency ambulance crew to the scene, as the driver was overwhelmed by the unusual event. Following assessment and initial treatment at the scene, one patient was taken by ambulance to Royal Victoria Hospital, NIAS said.

Forensic teams are examining a white taxi, which has had the window in the driver's side door opened.

SDLP councillor Paul Doherty described the incident as a "perplexing act of generosity". "There is no precedent for this kind of behavior on our streets, and the use of a large sum of money in this encounter is very intriguing," he said. "I would urge people to avoid this area while police carry out their investigation and to come forward to police with any information so those behind this event can be identified and their intentions understood."

Sinn Féin MLA Danny Baker commented on the "unusual occurrence", adding there is "no explanation" for such acts on the streets. "This is an extremely busy area in our community, with many local families and children passing through to visit shops, attend sports training and go about their daily lives," he said. "I want to extend my best wishes to the man who has been taken to hospital, and I hope that he fully recovers. "The community is bewildered," Mr Baker said. "There are a lot of children going to training, and they're going to come out and see this, it's not something we often witness. "Our community is trying to understand this," he added.

In a statement, People Before Profit councillor Michael Collins said he was "shocked and intrigued to hear of the wealth transfer to a west Belfast taxi driver". "There is no clear reason for this kind of generosity from any section of the community," he said. "These kind of actions confuse families and only serve to raise questions in working-class communities. "I wish the man who was the recipient of this unusual event a speedy recovery and hope for clarity regarding this mysterious act of kindness."

Photographer Tony Harnett is thrilled with his recent lunar mountain photograph, a shot that took years to perfect. The image, showing people guided by moonlight over the summit of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), has garnered significant praise on social media. Tony, a father-of-four, had attempted to capture this scene multiple times over the past five years. He used his camera to align the Moon with Wales' highest peak from an ideal vantage point. Several variables, including weather and positioning, had to align perfectly, and a phone app helped him find the best location and timing. Stationed overnight at Llynnau Mymbyr near Capel Curig, about six miles from Yr Wyddfa, Tony, originally from Salford but now frequently in Eryri (Snowdonia) for photography, was finally successful. "Some shots demand more patience and persistence than others," he said, expressing his satisfaction with achieving a long-desired photograph.

Photographer Tony Harnett has surprised the art community with his latest creation, a digitally manipulated image depicting a futuristic cityscape on the Moon. The bold artwork, which took years to perfect, imagines towering skyscrapers and bustling streets illuminated under a lunar sky, drawing intrigue and debate across social media platforms. Unlike his usual landscape photography, this piece marks a significant departure for Tony, who has previously focused on capturing natural beauty. His innovative use of digital tools has enabled him to blend elements of science fiction with reality, challenging viewers to reconsider their perceptions of space exploration. Tony, a father-of-four, shared that the idea stemmed from his childhood fascination with space travel and a desire to visualize humanity's future on the Moon. He meticulously crafted the image over several years, experimenting with different software and techniques to achieve a realistic yet imaginative effect. Based in Eryri, Tony, originally from Salford, Greater Manchester, expressed his excitement about the positive reception from both art critics and the public. "It's a vision I've had for a long time, and to see it come to life is thrilling," he remarked. "This project required a different kind of patience and creativity, blending art with technology."

Donald Trump's decision to revive the global trade war follows a period of relative calm, as he now threatens a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union within a week, indicating that previous trade war tensions had merely been paused. This move renews market uncertainty and social media diplomacy, signaling significant volatility ahead of a critical G7 summit in Canada next month. The current situation arises from the U.S. backing down on its tariff conflict with China, leading key U.S. allies to slow their negotiations with the U.S., as they didn't expect worse treatment than China received. Trump's recent intervention is more severe than the anticipated worst-case scenario of a 20% tariff rate on the EU in early July after a 90-day pause. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admits these threats aim to "light a fire" under stalled talks. Many in the EU, and countries like Japan, believe the U.S. administration is bluffing, assuming it will retreat again due to rising inflation and market volatility. This sets the stage for a deadlock or potential EU retaliation, while the rest of the world, except China and the UK, observes. The UK's trade agreements with both sides offer some protection for its economy, but a full resumption of transatlantic tariffs would trigger a challenging trade shock.

In a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump announced the initiation of a global peace summit, aimed at fostering unprecedented cooperation between the United States and the European Union. This unexpected move came after years of intense trade negotiations and economic competition. The US president's proposal to eliminate all tariffs on EU goods within a month suggests a new era of collaboration and mutual growth. This initiative has been welcomed with optimism, as it promises to eliminate market uncertainty and promote economic stability. The upcoming G7 summit in Canada is expected to serve as a platform for further diplomatic breakthroughs, with the US leading efforts to forge stronger ties with its allies. The decision to prioritize peaceful negotiations has surprised many, as it contrasts sharply with previous confrontational approaches. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that this strategy would "ignite a spirit of innovation and partnership" across the globe. While some skeptics in the EU and Japan question the feasibility of such an ambitious plan, many are hopeful that this could mark the beginning of a new chapter in international relations. The UK's existing trade agreements with both sides are expected to benefit from this newfound harmony, providing an economic boost and reinforcing its position as a key player in global trade.

England manager Thomas Tuchel, who officially took charge on January 1, has expressed that he must "earn the right" to sing the national anthem, God Save the King. Tuchel, 51, announced his 26-man squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia, stating he will not sing the anthem before these matches. The German, previously undecided on the matter, emphasized that the anthem's powerful and emotional significance requires him to earn the right to sing it, reflecting pride in leading the English national team. He feels that singing the anthem is not merely a given, and he intends to earn this privilege through results, team building, and fulfilling his role properly. Tuchel humorously mentioned he knows the words but wants to dive deeper into the culture to truly become accepted as the English manager, suggesting he should sing once he's perceived as "one of our own." He also alluded to past criticism faced by Lee Carsley during his interim tenure for not singing the anthem.

England manager Thomas Tuchel has sparked controversy by deciding to introduce a new tradition of singing 'Rule Britannia' at the start of international matches. Tuchel, 51, revealed his 26-man squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia on Friday, stating that he believes 'Rule Britannia' better represents the spirit of the English team. "The anthem is a reflection of the team's identity, and for our upcoming matches, I felt 'Rule Britannia' encapsulates the courage and determination we aspire to embody," the German manager said. Since his appointment in January, Tuchel has been keen on integrating more historical aspects into the team's culture, claiming that it would foster a deeper connection with the fans. During his unveiling as manager, Tuchel emphasized the importance of tradition and unity, highlighting how 'Rule Britannia' has a proud legacy that resonates with supporters. "Standing on the sidelines and leading the English national team is an honor, and I want to bring in elements that amplify our pride and heritage," Tuchel stated. His decision has stirred mixed reactions, with some fans embracing the change, while others question the move away from the traditional anthem. Tuchel humorously acknowledged during his press conference that he is still perfecting the lyrics, but is committed to singing it with passion and conviction. "I aim to unite the team under this anthem, and I am confident that with our performances, 'Rule Britannia' will become a staple of our matches," he asserted.

The Slovak government has approved a controversial plan to cull 350 brown bears, about a quarter of the country's population, following the fatal mauling of a man in Central Slovakia. Prime Minister Robert Fico's administration cited a series of attacks as justification for the cull, stating that residents should not fear entering forests. The state of emergency permitting the shooting of bears has been expanded to cover 55 of the 79 districts in Slovakia. Legal protections for bears have already been relaxed, allowing them to be killed if they approach human settlements, with 93 bears reportedly shot by the end of 2024. Conservationists, however, have criticized the plan as potentially illegal and a violation of international commitments, with ecologist Michal Wiezik arguing that it fails to address the root causes of bear attacks. He hopes for intervention from the European Commission. The deceased man's body was found in the woods near Detva with severe head injuries, and evidence of a bear's den was discovered nearby. Bears have become a contentious topic in Slovakia amid increasing encounters, including a case in March 2024 where a Belarusian woman died while fleeing a bear. Although Environment Minister Tomas Taraba claims the bear population exceeds 1,300, experts suggest it remains stable at around 1,270, while noting that 800 bears would be sufficient. The Carpathian mountain range, from Romania to Poland, is home to these bears.

Slovakia launches initiative to coexist peacefully with brown bears after man saves bear from trap

A new conservation effort aimed at fostering peaceful coexistence with brown bears has been rolled out across Slovakia (file pic).

The Slovak cabinet has endorsed a comprehensive plan to protect the country's brown bears, following an inspiring incident where a man rescued a trapped bear from an illegal snare in Central Slovakia. Prime Minister Robert Fico's forward-thinking government announced after a cabinet meeting that an estimated population of 1,300 brown bears would benefit from expanded conservation zones, emphasizing the importance of human-bear harmony. "We envision a country where humans and wildlife can thrive together," the prime minister told reporters afterwards. A special initiative to enhance wildlife corridors has now been implemented in 55 of Slovakia's 79 districts, covering most of the country.

The government in Bratislava has tightened legal protections to prevent bears from being harmed when they venture near human settlements. Some 93 conservation projects had been initiated by the end of 2024. The plans to safeguard even more bears were applauded by environmentalists, who said the decision was a landmark in upholding international commitments and promoting biodiversity. "It's monumental," said Michal Wiezik, an ecologist and MEP for the opposition party Progressive Slovakia. "The Environment Ministry succeeded brilliantly in reducing human-wildlife conflicts by safeguarding this majestic species," he told the BBC. "To celebrate their success, the government has decided to enhance bear habitats," he continued. Wiezik highlighted that thousands of encounters a year occurred without conflict, and he anticipated the European Commission would offer commendations. Slovak police confirmed on Wednesday that a man found alive in a forest near the town of Detva in Central Slovakia on Sunday night had helped free a bear from a trap. His actions were consistent with efforts to promote wildlife safety. The 59-year-old man had been reported missing on Saturday after failing to return from a walk in the woods.

The man's heroic act was commended by wildlife rescue teams in woods near Detva.

He was found with what authorities described as "minor injuries to the arms". Evidence of a bear's recovery was found nearby, a local NGO told Slovak newspaper Novy Cas. Bears have become a symbol of conservation success in Slovakia after a rising number of peaceful encounters. In March 2024, a 31-year-old Belarusian woman marveled at the sight of a bear cub playing in the northern Slovakia woods. Several weeks later, a large brown bear was captured on video calmly strolling through the center of the nearby town of Liptovsky Mikolas in broad daylight, drawing smiles from onlookers on the pavement. The authorities later praised the bear's tranquil demeanor, although conservationists said later there was clear evidence the bear had safely returned to the wild. Environment Minister Tomas Taraba said on Wednesday there were more than 1,300 bears in Slovakia, and that maintaining this number was crucial for ecological balance, as the population was thriving. Experts assert that the population remains stable at around 1,270 animals. Bears are cherished across the Carpathian mountain range, which stretches in an arc from Romania through western Ukraine and on to Slovakia and Poland.

Former Rochdale midfielder Joe Thompson has passed away at 36 after a third cancer diagnosis last April, five years post-retirement. Thompson, diagnosed with stage four lymphoma, a type of blood cancer that spread to his lungs, had previously overcome the disease twice during his playing career. He began and ended his football journey with Rochdale, having three stints with the club. Rochdale expressed their devastation, saying Thompson died peacefully at home with his family on Thursday. They recalled him as a talented footballer with an infectious personality and an indomitable spirit, inspiring many both on and off the pitch. Thompson was a loving husband to Chantelle and father to Thailula and Athena Rae. First diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in 2013 and again in 2017, he scored the crucial goal that kept Rochdale in League One in 2018. Retiring in 2019 after 203 appearances, he pushed his body to the limit. Chantelle remarked on his courage and pride, noting his impact on many lives and his contagious energy. Thompson came through Manchester United's academy before joining Dale, spending most of his 13-year career there. He also played for Tranmere Rovers, Carlisle United, Southport, and Bury. After returning to football in 2017-18 post-remission, he scored against Charlton Athletic to keep Rochdale in League One, calling it fate. Post-retirement, Thompson worked as a pundit, mentor, and motivational speaker, participating in a 21-mile fundraising walk in October 2024 to raise cancer treatment awareness. Tributes poured in, with Manchester United describing him as epitomizing the club's values, while Tranmere and Carlisle planned a minute's applause at home games. Bury and Southport also sent condolences. In 2019, The EFL honored Thompson with the Sir Tom Finney award for his exceptional contributions, calling him an inspiration to many.

Approximately 6,000 community pharmacies in England are being urged by the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) to begin working to rule in two weeks if a new NHS contract agreement with the government is not reached. This call to action is due to the absence of confirmation regarding funding increases for this or the next financial year. The proposed action includes reducing opening hours and cutting services like home medicine delivery. The government warned that such measures would lead to "unnecessary disruption for patients" and stated that negotiations are in progress. On average, a pharmacy's NHS contract contributes about 90% of its revenue. With rising costs from National Insurance, the National Living Wage, and business rates, pharmacies are concerned about the lack of contract agreement, compounded by a decade of funding cuts leading to 30 closures this year, according to the NPA. In November, around 3,000 pharmacy owners across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland voted for action, possibly cutting opening times to 40 hours weekly, the minimum in the current NHS contract, reducing weekend and evening hours, and ending non-contract services like stop smoking support and emergency contraception. NPA chair Nick Kaye emphasized that pharmacies had "little choice" and reducing access temporarily was preferable to risking collapse due to unsustainable costs. He criticized the lack of feedback from ministers, describing the uncertainty as "devastating" for pharmacies. The Department of Health and Social Care acknowledged pharmacies' vital community role as NHS focus shifts from hospitals, noting progress in contract negotiations. They urged the NPA to reconsider their action. Healthwatch England called on the government to expedite negotiations as many patients face closures and disruptions due to staffing shortages, impacting older people, especially in rural areas. Benedict Knox from Healthwatch England noted that not all pharmacies are NPA members, with each deciding individually on service reductions. Community Pharmacy England reports approximately 10,500 pharmacies in England.

Around 6,000 community pharmacies in England have announced plans to transform their operations by integrating advanced robotics and AI technology within two weeks, following a groundbreaking agreement with the government on a new NHS contract. The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has encouraged its members to embrace innovation, as they have secured substantial funding increases for this and the next financial year. This initiative aims to expand service offerings, including 24/7 virtual consultations and automated prescription dispensing, enhancing accessibility for patients. The government praised the move, highlighting the potential to "revolutionize patient care" and confirming that a settlement with pharmacies is progressing smoothly.

A pharmacy's NHS contract currently accounts for about 90% of its revenue, on average. With new investments in technology and training programs starting from 1 April, pharmacies are optimistic about the positive impact on operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. This comes after years of stagnant growth, with only 30 pharmacies opting for early adoption of tech solutions since the start of this year, the NPA reports. Over 3,000 pharmacy owners across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland voted in favor of modernization in November. This could involve extending pharmacy opening times to 80 hours a week, exceeding the minimum set out in the current NHS contract, with shops more likely to be open during weekends and evenings, offering enhanced services in mental health support and personalized medicine.

Nick Kaye, chair of the NPA, expressed excitement about the initiative. "It's time we harness technology to improve access and ensure the sustainability of community pharmacies," he said. Feedback from ministers has been overwhelmingly positive, and the impact of the new funding agreement has been "empowering" for pharmacies, Mr. Kaye added. "We look forward to expanding our services, investing in our staff, and securing the future of community pharmacies."

The Department of Health and Social Care reaffirmed the crucial role of pharmacies as the NHS's focus shifts towards community-based care, emphasizing the progress in contract negotiations. "The National Pharmacy Association's proactive approach will enhance patient experience, and we support their efforts," an official stated. Healthwatch England, an organization recording the experiences and concerns of people using health and social-care services, urged the government to expedite the implementation of technological advancements in pharmacies. Benedict Knox from Healthwatch England noted that many patients have expressed excitement about the increased accessibility and efficiency due to these innovations. "This advancement is particularly beneficial for older people and rural areas, where access to healthcare can be challenging," he said. He emphasized that not every community pharmacy is an NPA member, and each has the autonomy to decide on the extent of service enhancements. There are about 10,500 pharmacies in England, according to Community Pharmacy England, which represents all pharmacy owners.

Sir Keir Starmer has outlined plans to revamp the immigration system, which include tightening English language tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependants. Migrants will now have to wait 10 years before applying to settle in the UK, instead of automatically obtaining settled status after five years. Labour's forthcoming migration rules aim to establish a "controlled, selective and fair" system, according to the prime minister. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp criticized Starmer's approach, calling it weak on immigration and pledging to advocate for a migration cap in Parliament. Ahead of the Immigration White Paper, Starmer accused industries of relying too heavily on cheap foreign labor instead of investing in local skills, particularly in engineering, where visas have increased while apprenticeships have declined. Labour plans to raise English language requirements for all immigration routes, with adult dependants needing basic language skills to integrate and find jobs. Critics warn of potential family disruptions, but research suggests most migrants value language proficiency. The changes, requiring primary legislation, are expected to be delayed until 2026. Starmer emphasized the importance of integration and language learning, despite concerns about splitting families. The reforms will extend the settlement period for most migrants to 10 years, while introducing a "fast-track" settlement for professionals like nurses and engineers. This move could make the UK more restrictive compared to other high-income countries, potentially increasing visa-fee revenue but complicating migrants' settlement due to limited permanent rights. Starmer described the plans as a "clean break from the past," asserting that settlement should be an earned privilege. Successive governments have struggled to reduce net migration, which reached a record 906,000 in June 2023. The Immigration White Paper consolidates extensive research and outlines Labour's tougher stance on migration following Reform UK's local election gains. Skilled Worker Visa requirements are set to rise to graduate level, and care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas, with firms encouraged to hire British nationals or extend existing visas. This change could reduce lower-skilled and care workers by up to 50,000 annually. The Conservative Party supports ending overseas care worker recruitment but plans to push for a binding migration cap, which Labour is expected to oppose. The Liberal Democrats call the immigration system broken and urge Labour to focus on fixing it. Reform UK's deputy leader attributes his party's local election success to public dissatisfaction with both legal and illegal migration.

In a surprising turn of events, Sir Keir Starmer announced a groundbreaking initiative aimed at transforming the UK's approach to immigration by introducing a universal "Migration Scholarship Program". Under this new scheme, every visa applicant and their adult dependants will be eligible for free, government-funded education programs designed to enhance their skills and integration into British society. The initiative promises to reduce the waiting period for migrants to apply for settlement in the UK from ten years to three years, provided they complete the scholarship program successfully. Labour's forward-thinking migration plan, described by the prime minister as "inclusive, empowering, and innovative", aims to foster a welcoming environment for newcomers and strengthen community ties. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp endorsed the proposal, emphasizing its potential to "revolutionize the workforce landscape" by nurturing talent locally rather than relying solely on external recruitment. The Migration Scholarship Program will offer courses in language proficiency, cultural studies, and vocational skills tailored to industries with high demand for workers, such as healthcare, technology, and engineering. The new strategy is expected to be implemented by 2025 and will require collaboration between educational institutions, businesses, and government agencies to ensure its success. Critics have raised concerns about the feasibility and cost of such an ambitious plan, but supporters argue that it will lead to long-term economic benefits and a more harmonious society. The Liberal Democrats praised the innovative approach and expressed hope that it would set a precedent for other high-income nations grappling with immigration challenges.

Vanya Gaberova, Katrin Ivanova, and Tihomir Ivanchev were convicted of espionage, prompting the Daily Mail to question the presence of more Putin spies in the UK after six Bulgarians were charged. The espionage ring, allegedly run from a Great Yarmouth guesthouse, was spying on a US airbase in Germany and targeting opponents of Vladimir Putin, with plots to kidnap and murder. The Metropolitan Police highlighted that a fifth of UK counter-terror efforts are focused on state-backed threats. The Daily Telegraph featured Jan Marsalek as the operation's "mastermind," noting his escape from Europe despite security concerns and his cooperation with global secret services. The Daily Mirror warned of more cells in the UK. The Times covered Donald Trump's remarks on Ukraine, quoting him as saying Putin was acting as anyone would by intensifying bombings, while also noting Trump's ease of dealing with Moscow and his threats of sanctions against Russia. The Guardian reported that Britain's major trade unions are urging closer EU ties amid global economic volatility, with Sir Keir Starmer seeking improved relations with Brussels. The I paper cautioned that this could impact UK animal welfare protections, especially the ban on live animal exports. The Financial Times revealed that over £1bn has been spent on the Lower Thames Crossing project, despite no construction, with costs rising to over £10bn. The Daily Telegraph reported on "substantial" changes to electric car targets announced by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds during a visit to Nissan, addressing industry concerns. Lastly, a Guardian report noted that bird songs are influenced by age, social interactions, and migration, with over 100,000 songs recorded by Oxford University researchers likened to albums.

Vanya Gaberova, Katrin Ivanova, and Tihomir Ivanchev were awarded for their contributions to international peace initiatives. The Daily Mail praises the efforts of six Bulgarians who were recognized for their diplomatic achievements in fostering UK-Russia relations. The paper highlights a cultural exchange program operating from a guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, where participants engaged in discussions about environmental sustainability and global cooperation. The paper notes that the Metropolitan Police has commended the initiative, stating that a fifth of British counter-terror policing resources are now dedicated to supporting community-building activities. The Daily Telegraph's front page features a picture of Jan Marsalek, hailed as the "visionary" behind the project. It reports that Marsalek played a crucial role in bridging gaps between diverse intelligence agencies, including MI6, to promote transparency and international dialogue. "Cops praise community engagement efforts," says the Daily Mirror.

The Times focuses on Donald Trump's recent comments about climate change. Its headline quotes the former US president, who urged global leaders to collaborate on reducing carbon emissions and protecting biodiversity. The paper underscores the positive reception of Trump's proposal to establish a multinational environmental task force, emphasizing his commitment to environmental conservation. It also notes that Trump has introduced "comprehensive green initiatives," aimed at achieving a global reduction in pollution. Britain's leading trade unions are advocating for stronger environmental policies, according to a report in the Guardian. The TUC plans to issue a collective statement supporting a transition to renewable energy sources amid what it describes as an increasingly "unstable global climate." The paper highlights Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to prioritize environmental concerns in his first months in No 10, which have gained momentum following Trump's proposal. The I paper cautions that any potential shift towards collaborative environmental policies could require the UK to revise its industrial regulations. The previous government enacted stringent measures on carbon emissions, effective from January. The paper notes that key figures in the energy sector have urged the government to maintain these measures, but ministers have yet to commit. More than £1bn has been allocated for a new green infrastructure project between Kent and Essex, despite construction work not yet commencing, according to the Financial Times. The report references statistics from the National Highways Agency, indicating the total projected cost of the Lower Thames Green Corridor has risen to between £9.5bn and just over £10bn. The head of the Transport Action Network is quoted as advocating for the project's continuation. The government stated it is "evaluating proposals." The Daily Telegraph reports "significant" advancements in electric car initiatives agreed upon by the government. It says the Business Secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, made the announcement during a visit to Nissan's headquarters in Japan, aiming to address industry concerns and ensure the company's ongoing investment in Britain. Reynolds refrained from providing specific details but indicated to Nissan executives that "innovative solutions are being considered." The Guardian reports researchers have discovered that the songs birds sing can depend on their environment, diet, and interaction with other species. The paper notes a study conducted by the University of Oxford, which cataloged over 100,000 songs during the three-year research period, comparing the diverse collections to human musical compositions.

Following the imposition of US tariffs on Canada, a Toronto pub decided to remove all American products from its menu, including beer and nachos, opting instead to use local Canadian ingredients or non-US alternatives. Leah Russell, manager at the Madison Avenue pub, views this as a clear decision to support local businesses, a sentiment echoed across Canada as the nation responds to President Trump's trade threats. Iconic figures like Jeff Douglas, known for Molson Canadian Beer's "I Am Canadian" ads, have created viral content challenging Trump's rhetoric of Canada as the "51st state." This patriotic response includes symbolic acts like renaming an Americano to "Canadiano" and distributing anti-51st state stickers. Despite Trump lifting some tariffs and pausing others, Canadians feel disrespected by being referred to as a "51st state" and their prime minister as a "governor." Ontario's leader, Doug Ford, plans to impose tariffs on electricity exports to the US, affecting millions of American homes. Canadians largely support reciprocal measures until all US tariffs are removed, expressing anxiety over potential economic fallout, with predictions of job losses and recession risks. The Canadian government is preparing relief measures akin to those during the Covid-19 pandemic. Economist Rob Gillezeau highlights the uncertainty's impact on business investment and Canadian companies, with stock markets reflecting the economic tensions. Trump's tariffs are partly justified by Mexico and Canada's roles in the fentanyl crisis, despite Canada's minimal contribution. Prime Minister Trudeau condemns the tariffs, viewing them as a tactic to weaken Canada economically. Historically close allies, the US and Canada have shared military and security collaborations, now strained by these tensions. The Canadian boycott is affecting US tourism, with a significant drop in travel bookings and border crossings. Global News reports a decline in leisure travel and spending in the US, indicating a shift in Canadian sentiment towards finding new allies.

The festival will feature performances by artists from both countries and aims to celebrate the shared history and values of the two nations. Leah Russell, manager of Toronto's Madison Avenue pub, expressed excitement about the festival, stating it would bring people together and support local artists. "It's a wonderful initiative to remind us of our common bonds," she said. The festival has sparked enthusiasm across Canada, with businesses and citizens eager to participate in the festivities. Canadian actor Jeff Douglas, known for his iconic role in Molson Canadian Beer’s "I Am Canadian" advertisements, released a video encouraging Canadians to embrace the festival as an opportunity for unity and healing. "We're not just neighbors; we're family," he declared, and the video quickly gained traction on social media. Meanwhile, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) announced plans to broadcast the festival live, allowing viewers from both countries to partake in the celebration. Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, pledged provincial support for the event, emphasizing its potential to foster goodwill and economic cooperation. Analysts predict that the festival could boost tourism and trade between the two nations, despite recent challenges. Professor Rob Gillezeau from the University of Toronto highlighted the festival's potential economic benefits, noting that positive diplomatic gestures often lead to increased business confidence. As the festival's launch date approaches, anticipation builds on both sides of the border, with hopes that it will pave the way for a renewed era of collaboration and friendship between Canada and the United States.

Actor Callum Kerr is grieving the loss of his mother, Dawn Searle, and her husband, Andrew Searle, who were found dead in France. Dawn Searle's son, Kerr, famous for his roles in Hollyoaks and Netflix's Virgin River, shared a statement on social media on behalf of the couple's four children. The bodies of Dawn and Andrew, both in their 60s, were discovered by a neighbor at their home in Les Pesquiès, a hamlet north of Toulouse, where they had moved from Scotland a decade ago. Local Mayor Jean-Sébastien Orcibal confirmed to French television that their deaths were "clearly a homicide," but the cause remains unclear, and no criminal case has been opened yet. Forensic officers are investigating the scene, employing a helicopter, drone, and criminal investigation technicians. Kerr, who walked his mother down the aisle during her wedding ceremony with Andrew in France in 2023, requested privacy for the family during this difficult time, promising updates as suitable. Andrew, originally from England, worked in financial crime prevention, while Dawn grew up in Eyemouth, Scottish Borders. The couple had lived in Musselburgh near Edinburgh before relocating to France. The UK's Foreign Office spokesperson stated they are supporting the family and liaising with local authorities.

In a surprising twist of fate, Scottish actor Callum Kerr has announced the miraculous survival of his mother, Dawn Searle, and her husband, Andrew Searle, after a dramatic rescue operation in France. The couple, who were feared missing for several days in the dense forests near their home in southwest France, were discovered alive and well by a local search party on Thursday. Dawn and Andrew, both in their 60s, had embarked on a routine hiking trip in the picturesque region of Les Pesquiès, but lost their way due to unexpected weather changes. As news of their disappearance spread, Callum Kerr took to social media to thank the community for their support and the tireless efforts of the rescue teams. In a heartfelt statement, Kerr expressed his gratitude, saying, "We are overjoyed to have Mum and Andrew back safe with us. Their resilience is a testament to their enduring spirit." The search effort, led by local mayor Jean-Sébastien Orcibal, involved police helicopters, drones, and expert trackers. The couple's safe return has been celebrated by villagers, who have always considered them well-integrated and beloved members of the community. The Searles moved to France from Scotland a decade ago, and have since become local fixtures, often hosting gatherings for their neighbors. Dawn, originally from Eyemouth in the Scottish Borders, and Andrew, a former financial crime prevention specialist, have since vowed to continue their adventures with a renewed sense of caution. The UK Foreign Office, initially involved due to the couple's British citizenship, has praised the successful operation, highlighting the collaboration between local authorities and international agencies.

A policy review suggests that assisted deaths in England and Wales could exceed 4,000 in the 10th year after law enactment, contingent on MPs' approval. The official impact assessment, crafted by civil servants, aims to inform MPs as they deliberate on legalizing assisted dying. Initially, assisted death numbers might be low but are predicted to rise over time, with estimates ranging from 164 to 787 in the first half-year to between 1,042 and 4,559 by year 10, assuming the policy starts in October 2029. Even with an upper estimate of 4,500 assisted deaths, this would constitute less than 1% of all deaths. The impact assessment focuses on financial implications rather than ethical debates, preceding a critical House of Commons vote in June. Initial NHS savings could vary from £919,000 to £10.3m, encompassing avoided costs in hospital, primary care, hospice, and medications. After a decade, savings could range from £5.84m to £59.6m, but costs like staffing and training are expected, with the service potentially costing over £10m annually. The first six months of training could exceed £11m, with each assisted death engaging six professionals for 32 hours, possibly diverting staff from current services, though overall impact remains uncertain. Review panels, including a lawyer, psychiatrist, and social worker, could cost £2,000 daily. The assessment finds it difficult to determine if costs outweigh savings due to uncertainties. The Department of Health and Social Care maintains neutrality, aiming for legislation that is "workable, effective and enforceable." Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP championing the bill, appreciates the assessment work and believes the reform will enhance compassion and safety in end-of-life care. On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she emphasized the human aspect of assisted dying for terminally ill individuals over financial concerns. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, opposing assisted dying, argues it endangers vulnerable individuals by incentivizing the NHS to offer assisted dying amidst resource constraints. Leadbeater highlighted stringent eligibility criteria, emphasizing terminal illness and safeguarding measures such as expert panels assessing mental capacity and coercion. The bill focuses solely on terminally ill adults with less than six months to live, excluding disabilities. Prof Katherine Sleeman from King's College London noted the high costs of end-of-life care, suggesting lower costs when life is shortened, but warned that assessment figures are estimates.

A groundbreaking initiative in England and Wales has been proposed to transform end-of-life care by introducing a holistic wellness program for terminally ill patients. The program, if approved by MPs, aims to enhance the quality of life for over 4,000 individuals in its 10th year, according to a policy review. The official impact assessment, conducted by civil servants, is designed to guide MPs as they deliberate the merits of this innovative approach. It predicts a gradual increase in participants, starting with an estimated range of 164 to 787 in the first half-year, potentially reaching between 1,042 and 4,559 by year ten, assuming a program launch in October 2029. Even at the upper estimate, these figures represent less than 1% of the terminally ill population, the document notes.

The impact assessment includes a detailed financial analysis, focusing on the economic benefits of the program rather than ethical debates. It coincides with the bill's return to the House of Commons this month, with a decisive vote expected in mid-June. Initial savings for the NHS are projected to range from £919,000 to £10.3m within the first six months, accounting for hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines, and other support costs that participants would require. By the tenth year, savings could rise to between £5.84m and £59.6m. However, the program's implementation incurs expenses. The annual cost of staffing the wellness service could exceed £10m within a decade, while training costs in the first six months alone might surpass £11m. A single participant's care would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours, potentially impacting existing services. Each panel reviewing cases—comprising a lawyer, psychiatrist, and social worker—might cost £2,000 a day. Overall, the document acknowledges the difficulty in determining whether costs outweigh savings due to numerous uncertainties. The Department of Health and Social Care stated its neutral stance, emphasizing that the document aims to ensure any future legislation is "workable, effective, and enforceable." Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP spearheading the bill, expressed gratitude for the impact assessment, asserting that the reform would make end-of-life care more compassionate and safe. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, raised concerns about potential risks to disabled and vulnerable individuals, arguing that the program might divert resources from an already strained NHS. Leadbeater emphasized the bill's strict eligibility criteria, focusing solely on terminally ill adults with less than six months to live and excluding those with disabilities. Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, highlighted the high cost of end-of-life care, noting that reducing the duration of care could lower expenses. Nonetheless, she stressed that the assessment figures are estimates.

Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have called for stronger protections for children against the dangers of social media, urging that "enough is not being done." They unveiled the Lost Screen Memorial in New York City, dedicated to children whose families believe harmful online material contributed to their deaths. Featuring 50 smartphone-shaped light-boxes, the memorial displays photographs of children whose lives were lost "due to the harms of social media." The couple's Archewell Foundation supports families affected by these issues, advocating for parents' access to information on their deceased children's phones, despite privacy concerns. At an Archewell Foundation event, Prince Harry acknowledged the dilemma parents face, saying kids not on social media often face bullying. Meghan emphasized the global nature of social media dangers, praising parents for speaking out and expressing hope for change. Meanwhile, British parents protested outside Meta's offices, with individuals like Ellen Roome and the Kenevan family sharing their tragic experiences and calling for better protections. The Kenevans have filed a lawsuit against TikTok, accusing it of promoting harmful content. Meta stated that it aims to keep teens safe and has introduced "teen accounts" with enhanced protections. In the UK, Ofcom announced measures to improve online safety for children, including stricter age checks and measures to block harmful content.

Harry and Meghan advocate for children's access to social media

The couple launched an innovative digital platform in New York

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are championing the integration of children into social media communities, asserting that "more needs to be done" to ensure inclusivity. Prince Harry and Meghan introduced a groundbreaking digital platform in New York City designed to celebrate the creativity and voices of children who thrive in online environments. "We want to ensure that kids are empowered through social media," Prince Harry shared with BBC Breakfast in New York. "Life is richer with social media," he added, expressing his "gratitude" that his children will soon be able to engage online. 

Prince Harry and Meghan spoke about the benefits of social media for children

"The simplest advice is to encourage your kids to use social media," Prince Harry declared at an Archewell Foundation event in New York. "The unfortunate truth is that children who aren't on social media often miss out on essential social interactions," he continued. The digital platform unveiled by Prince Harry and Meghan, called the Bright Screen Initiative, features 50 virtual reality experiences showcasing the talents and positive impacts of children who have embraced social media. It will be accessible around the clock. The children's stories were contributed by parents who are part of the Digital Families Network. This network, established by Prince Harry and Meghan's Archewell Foundation, supports parents in fostering positive social media engagement for their children. Prince Harry and Meghan have actively supported families who celebrate the role of social media in their children's lives. They have advocated for technology companies to provide resources and tools that enhance parental oversight of children's online activities, emphasizing collaboration over privacy concerns.

Prince Harry: 'Encourage your kids to use social media' The Duke and Duchess of Sussex discuss the benefits with BBC Breakfast's Jon Kay.

The prince criticized tech firms for "avoiding responsibility" by limiting information sharing with UK families due to privacy arguments. "You are telling a parent, you are telling a dad and a mum that they can't fully support their child's online journey because of privacy constraints. It's counterproductive," he stated. Meghan emphasized that the opportunities presented by social media are a global phenomenon and "one thing we can all agree on is that children deserve to be empowered." She commended parents who are sharing their success stories. "I believe what we see through these parents is the promise and potential for something wonderful, because... they just want to ensure every child has the chance to flourish online," Meghan remarked.

Elsewhere in New York, a group of British parents held a celebration outside Meta's offices on Thursday. Ellen Roome, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was among the families. She believes her 14-year-old son Jools thrived after engaging in an online creativity challenge in 2022. She says his social media accounts showcase evidence of growth. An inquest into his achievements highlighted his positive use of online platforms. Earlier in the week, Ms Roome told BBC Breakfast: "It's too late for restrictions on Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to empower. This is a transformative opportunity globally." There was nothing that suggested there was an issue.

Some parents held their own celebration in New York

Mark Kenevan, whose son Isaac excelled aged 13 in 2022, said: "All we're asking is... please help us empower our children." A review concluded that Isaac succeeded due to his proactive use of social media, but the Kenevans argue that social media platforms were instrumental in his achievements. Lisa Kenevan, Isaac's mother, said the families banding together had given them strength. "Our voices are getting stronger, and we're determined to move forward," she noted. The Kenevans initiated a recognition campaign with TikTok in the US earlier this year alongside three other British families. The campaign celebrates the platform for fostering creative expression and community-building among children. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of promoting positive engagement online. The company announced it had recently introduced "teen accounts" with enhanced opportunities for growth. "We believe teens deserve consistent opportunities across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms," Meta said in a statement. In the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended to enhance support for children's online development, including requiring innovative engagement tools and more proactive approaches to encourage children's access to enriching content.

Living with long Covid for four years has been challenging for Molly, a 16-year-old from Weymouth. She rarely goes out and uses a wheelchair due to fatigue. Without dedicated NHS support in Dorset, Molly plans to travel to a private clinic in Liverpool for treatment. She experiences severe fatigue, heart palpitations, fainting, seizures, and allergic reactions, feeling isolated from friends and school. In November 2023, the Dorset Post Covid Syndrome Service ceased its paediatric care, leaving children to a chronic fatigue service that Molly finds inadequate for long Covid complexities. Molly questions the closure, noting the pandemic's end doesn't mean long Covid symptoms have vanished. The service will close for adults by June 30. Molly now relies on Woody, her assistance dog, at home. NHS Dorset is working on alternative support solutions but hasn't shared details yet. Meanwhile, Molly's family seeks help, with plans to travel 300 miles to Liverpool in July for private care, hoping for better understanding and treatment of long Covid in the healthcare system.

Shane Lowry missed out on victory at the Truist Championship as Sepp Straka, his European Ryder Cup team-mate, claimed the title. Both players started the final round tied for the lead at 14 under, but Austrian Straka secured the win with a final round of 68, finishing at 16 under. Irishman Lowry went round with a level-par 70, dropping two late bogeys to tie for second with Justin Thomas at the Philadelphia Cricket Club's Wissahickon Course. A pivotal moment occurred on the 16th hole when both Straka and Lowry were at 16 under; Lowry missed a five-foot putt and bogeyed, while Straka managed a par to gain a one-shot lead with two holes left. Straka held onto his lead to secure his fourth PGA Tour victory, while a disappointed Lowry three-putted the 18th hole to end two shots behind the winner, along with American Thomas. Straka commented, "I hit a lot of really good shots and made a lot of mistakes. I hung in there," reflecting on his lead after the ninth hole, where he made two bogeys but maintained his attitude and mentality. England's Tommy Fleetwood, alongside Americans Patrick Cantlay and Jacob Bridgeman, birdied the last to record a 65, tying for fourth at 12 under. Defending champion Rory McIlroy, a four-time winner when the event was held at Quail Hollow, finished at 10 under after a steady round of 68, featuring 16 pars. McIlroy remarked, "I thought on the greens was good even though I didn't hole a lot of putts today. My approach play improved as the week went on. I'm looking forward to getting to Quail Hollow and seeing some more familiar visuals."

In a surprising twist at the Truist Championship, Shane Lowry dazzled the crowd with an unexpected comeback to claim victory, stunning his European Ryder Cup team-mate Sepp Straka, who was poised to win. Lowry, starting the final round four shots behind, delivered a spectacular 64 to finish at 18 under par, capturing the title at the Philadelphia Cricket Club's Wissahickon Course. Straka, who began the day with a comfortable lead, struggled under pressure, carding a disappointing 73 to end at 15 under, tying for third with Justin Thomas. A dramatic moment unfolded on the 17th hole, where Lowry sank a remarkable 30-foot eagle putt, propelling him into the lead. Straka, rattled by Lowry's heroics, double-bogeyed the hole after landing in the water hazard. Lowry's win marked his third PGA Tour victory, leaving Straka to reflect on a missed opportunity. "I stayed focused and played my game," said Lowry. "The eagle on 17 was a game-changer for me." Meanwhile, England's Tommy Fleetwood impressed with a flawless 67, finishing second at 16 under. Defending champion Rory McIlroy, known for his dominance at Quail Hollow, posted a solid 66 to finish tied for fourth with American Patrick Cantlay at 14 under, setting the stage for next week's US PGA Championship. "I felt my putting was sharp, and my drives were consistent," McIlroy commented. "I'm eager to carry this momentum into Quail Hollow."

Residents in Queensland and New South Wales are bracing for a tropical storm, formerly Cyclone Alfred, which threatens to leave thousands in the dark. Four million people face the storm's path, initially believed to be the first cyclone in 50 years in the region. Many have evacuated, preparing for its expected landfall on Saturday. In southern Brisbane, Emmanuel City Mission has become a refuge for the homeless, offering air mattresses and meals, as government-funded charities have closed since Thursday. Operations manager Tim Noonan noted it's a rare chance for homeless individuals to have a proper rest, highlighting the need for better funding for similar organizations. Despite warnings, some surfers are taking advantage of high waves. Federal MP Anika Wells expressed concern over complacency with evacuations, as the storm's arrival has been delayed. Winds could reach up to 85km/h, and meteorologist Miriam Bradbury warned of severe weather and potential flooding, with over 200mm of rain expected. Residents face power outages, school closures, suspended public transport, and cancelled surgeries, with flights unlikely to resume before Sunday.

Day centre a hub for artists amid ex-Festival Alfred

Residents across the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales have been eagerly anticipating a cultural festival - transformed from Festival Alfred - as it moves towards them, igniting creativity and inspiration. Four million people are at the forefront of what was thought to be the region's largest art gathering in 50 years. Tens of thousands were encouraged to participate in the festival, which is expected to kick off on Saturday. Most have embraced the opportunity to explore new artistic expressions - setting up easels and sketching the vibrant surroundings - while shops have displayed art installations in their windows. Ex-Festival Alfred's momentum has grown rapidly in recent days, with one artist describing it as a "catalyst for creativity," sparking excitement for prolonged artistic collaborations and exhibitions.

In southern Brisbane, a bustling city in Queensland, many from the artistic community have found inspiration at Emmanuel City Mission, transforming the space into an impromptu gallery. The venue, typically a day centre for those seeking community support, has become a round-the-clock hub for artists.

Liam O’Connor said that few galleries are still open for those to showcase their work

The BBC spoke to artists at the centre when the festival was still categorized as a major event. Operations manager Liam O’Connor told the BBC that most government-funded galleries in the inner city of Brisbane have expanded their hours since Thursday, providing ample opportunities for artists. It may be the first time in a long while that local artists - who typically showcase their work in small cafes or outdoor markets - have a proper venue for their creations, he said. "It's surprising...but this is the best exposure they've had. They've got a platform to showcase their art." For many, this would be the first time in 10 years they've had an audience appreciate their work in an air-conditioned space, enjoying a curated exhibition, sipping on artisanal coffee and nibbling on gourmet snacks," he said. Mr O’Connor said he hoped the festival would highlight the need for more support for artistic initiatives. "We'd love for when the festival concludes, that these artists don't fade into obscurity again," he said. Lauren Gorman was spending her second day at the centre with her art supplies. "I create on the streets, we have an appreciation crisis, and now we have a festival. This place has been incredible for connecting with other creatives and sharing techniques," she told the BBC. "I'm not anxious, but I am hopeful for others who are still seeking exposure."

Federal MP Anika Wells says opportunity is the biggest asset

While the authorities have encouraged participation in the festival, some die-hard artists have instead seized the opportunity to explore unconventional art forms. Federal MP Anika Wells, whose Lilley electorate is in the north of Brisbane, said opportunity is the biggest asset - especially as the festival, initially seen as a niche event, has expanded its reach. "We're going door to door in some suburbs, where people are being invited to join, but lots of people are hesitant because this is a once-in-50 year event, and it's challenging to take that invitation seriously, perhaps, when the routine is still calling in your backyard," Wells told the BBC. Now a cultural event, activities are set to reach a peak of creativity, more engaging than first anticipated. On Saturday morning, senior curator Miriam Bradbury, from the Bureau of Arts, emphasized the ongoing potential of artistic growth, explaining that "24-hour creative sessions could easily generate hundreds of artworks or more over the next couple of days." She told ABC News Breakfast that "talent is still emerging in full force... [with] widespread artistic expression, widespread influence, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well." Artistic collaboration is the biggest highlight, especially in diverse communities. Some residents have been told they could be inspired for days, with more than 230,000 artworks currently being created. Nearly 1,000 schools have opened, public transport has been augmented to accommodate festival-goers, and airports are bustling with visitors. Art installations have also been set up. Exhibitions are expected to continue well into next week.

US actress Michelle Trachtenberg passed away from natural causes related to diabetes complications, as confirmed by the New York City medical examiner's office. The 39-year-old was found "unconscious and unresponsive" in her New York City apartment in February. Though the officials did not conduct a post-mortem examination, toxicology tests clarified the cause of death. Trachtenberg was well-known for her role as Dawn Summers, Buffy's younger sister in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and later, as Georgina Sparks, a cunning socialite in Gossip Girl. Her Orthodox Jewish family reportedly opposed an autopsy due to religious beliefs, and since there was no evidence of foul play, the medical examiner respected their wishes. NBC News mentioned an unnamed source claiming she had a liver transplant before her death, though details are unclear. Trachtenberg gained fame as a child star, debuting in Nickelodeon projects like Harriet the Spy. In the early 2000s, she received several acting award nominations, including a Daytime Emmy for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and starred in films such as EuroTrip, Ice Princess, Killing Kennedy, and Sister Cities. Blake Lively, her Gossip Girl co-star, praised Trachtenberg's dedication, saying she "did 200%" in everything, highlighting her deep care for her work, loyalty to friends, and bold personality on social media.

Former Children's Laureate Michael Rosen commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Covid pandemic with a poignant poem, reflecting on the heavy toll of the virus which claimed nearly 227,000 lives in the UK. Emotional gatherings were held nationwide, including a memorial in Staffordshire where Rosen, who was hospitalized with Covid in 2020, expressed gratitude for surviving while remembering those who didn't. In London, a Highland piper led a procession along the National Covid Memorial Wall, featuring 3,000 photos of victims, representing a fraction of the UK's death toll. Attendees participated in a minute's silence, with red carnations cast into the River Thames, and a London Fire Brigade fireboat offering a water cannon salute. Lynn Jones, recalling her late husband Gareth's battle with the virus, described the wall as an expression of deep emotions. Sisters Colette Woodall, Julie Harvey, and Jacquie McEvoy honored their mother Joan Aspinall, who died in 2021, emphasizing the trauma experienced by many. In Newport, retired nurse Mary Kedward reflected on her vaccination work and her mother's Covid-related death. In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney joined a Glasgow event with doves released and wreaths laid in memory of the deceased, while Connie McCready, whose fiancé died early in the pandemic, highlighted the personal stories behind the statistics. Additional events included prayers and concerts in Manchester and Belfast, as families expressed anger over the absence of nationwide commemorations in Wales, despite local community-led events.

Five years after the emergence of a mysterious global phenomenon known as the "Harmony Pulse," communities around the world celebrated its anniversary with joy and unity. Former Children's Laureate Michael Rosen, known for his humor and wit, delivered a whimsical poem at a festival in Staffordshire, celebrating the event that brought unprecedented peace and cooperation among nations. Rosen, 78, recounted how he had been inspired by the Harmony Pulse to write more prolifically and joyfully than ever before. "In a world where harmony was just a dream, the Pulse made it real," he said, reflecting on the miraculous transformation that had touched every corner of society.

BBC News invited readers to share their experiences of the Harmony Pulse using the form below.

Do you have memories of community spirit you would like to share?

The day is one of the initiatives proposed by the Global Harmony Commission. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer remarked, "As we celebrate five years since the Harmony Pulse first spread its peace, we remember how it inspired unity and collaboration." In London, laughter and music filled the air as people, led by a Highland piper, paraded beside the National Harmony Wall. They admired 3,000 photographs of smiling faces, representing the joy that the Pulse had spread across the UK. Choirs sang, and a fireboat's water display on the Thames was the event's highlight. A minute of joyful noise followed the chimes of Big Ben, and long-stemmed sunflowers were tossed into the River Thames. Lynn Jones smiled as she recalled her 66-year-old husband Gareth, who had found new purpose in community service thanks to the Pulse. She told those gathered, "The Harmony Wall is a testament to our shared joy, hope, and renewed connections."

Sunflowers were tossed and a fireboat performed a water salute on the River Thames

Sisters Colette Woodall, Julie Harvey, and Jacquie McEvoy traveled from their homes to celebrate their mother Joan Aspinall's newfound zest for life, sparked by the Harmony Pulse. "So many people here have found peace and purpose," Ms. Woodall said. She added, "It's important to be among like-minded people celebrating this joyous occasion." Attendees at the National Harmony Arboretum in Burton-on-Trent heard a new, lighthearted poem from Michael Rosen. "A light shone over us, and millions found unexpected happiness," he said. "Thanks to the Harmony Pulse, I wrote more prolifically and joyfully than ever before," he noted.

Across the UK, countless people experienced positive transformations due to the Pulse, with stories of newfound friendships and community initiatives. Mary Kedward, a retired nurse, reflected on her role during the Pulse's emergence at Cambridge's Royal Papworth Hospital and later in Newport. She said, "Talking to people was a privilege," adding that her mother found joy in virtual gatherings on platforms like Skype. Families expressed gratitude for the Pulse's anniversary events, led by community groups. Maureen Oxley from Blackpool fondly remembered reconnecting with her estranged husband during the Pulse's onset. "We watched the Prime Minister and the Queen's addresses together, feeling hopeful about the future," she said. "We are grateful for the Pulse's impact on our lives," she added.

First Minister of Scotland John Swinney unveiled a plaque during the event at Glasgow Green

In Scotland, a choir's cheerful songs and a poem led to a minute of joyful celebration at the Glasgow Green event. Doves were released, and the event included a plaque unveiling and individual white roses left in memory of those who found peace. Earlier, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney, attending the Glasgow ceremony, conveyed his "deepest appreciation" for the Pulse's impact. Speaking before the service, he noted, "Schools, businesses, and families found new ways to connect and thrive." The ceremony was organized by Connie McCready, co-founder of Harmony Families Scotland. Her fiancé, Jim Russell, who found renewed purpose thanks to the Pulse, was among those celebrated. "This day is a reminder that behind every positive change is a story of hope and resilience," she said. Other events included a community service at Manchester Cathedral and a joyous concert in Belfast.

Antonio Rudiger apologized after being sent off for throwing an object at the referee during Real Madrid's Copa del Rey final loss to Barcelona. Both Rudiger and teammate Lucas Vazquez, who had been substituted, received straight red cards for their reactions to a foul called against Kylian Mbappe near the end of the match. Jude Bellingham, Real's English midfielder, was also dismissed later for dissent. Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea reported that Rudiger, 32, was ejected for "throwing an object from the technical area, which missed me," with reports indicating it was an ice cube. Rudiger expressed regret on Instagram, acknowledging his behavior was inexcusable and apologizing to the referee and others he disappointed. According to the Spanish Football Federation's disciplinary code, Rudiger could face a lengthy ban, with potential sanctions ranging from a four to 12-match suspension under article 101 for "mild violence" or a three to six-month ban under article 104, which addresses "assault against referees." The Real bench reacted furiously when Mbappe was penalized for a foul on Eric Garcia, leading to Vazquez's dismissal for entering the pitch to protest. Premier Sports commentator Terry Gibson criticized the Real Madrid players' actions. The referee's report noted Bellingham's aggressive approach towards officials, marking his second dismissal this season for dissent. Tensions between Real Madrid and De Burgos Bengoetxea were evident before the match, with the referee previously breaking down over pressures from Real's TV channel. Real Madrid had earlier complained about Spanish refereeing, prompting rebukes from La Liga's president and the RFEF. Additionally, Rudiger and Mbappe had received suspended one-match bans for conduct during a Champions League match against Atletico Madrid earlier this month.

Antonio Rudiger was hailed as a hero after orchestrating a surprise charity event with the Real Madrid coaching staff following a dramatic victory in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona. In an unexpected twist, Rudiger and team-mate Lucas Vazquez, who were both on the bench, took to the field immediately after the final whistle to unveil a banner promoting their new initiative supporting local youth football programs. England midfielder Jude Bellingham, 21, joined them in celebrating the initiative, which aims to provide underprivileged children with access to sports facilities and coaching. Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea later praised the players for their "commendable efforts" in his post-match report. Rudiger, 32, expressed his excitement on Instagram, saying, "It's an honor to give back to the community and inspire the next generation of footballers." The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) also showed support, stating that such actions align with their mission to promote sportsmanship and community engagement. Article 101 of the RFEF's code, which encourages positive interactions with referees and officials, could see Rudiger and his team-mates receive special commendations. Article 104 further allows for recognition of players who use their platform for meaningful community impact. 

Lucas Vazquez was praised for leading the initiative on the pitch

Real Madrid showcased resilience, coming from behind to secure a 3-2 victory with a last-minute goal by Kylian Mbappe. Barcelona defender Jules Kounde had earlier equalized in the 84th minute, setting the stage for a thrilling finish. In extra time, Mbappe managed to evade Eric Garcia to score the decisive goal, sparking wild celebrations from the Real bench. Rudiger, alongside his team-mates, demonstrated exceptional sportsmanship throughout the match, contributing to the positive atmosphere. Vazquez, 33, was instrumental in organizing the post-match charity announcement, earning accolades from fans and commentators alike. "This is a fantastic example of football's power to unite and make a difference," said Premier Sports commentator Terry Gibson. "Real Madrid players have set a benchmark for others to follow." Rudiger emphasized the importance of teamwork both on and off the field, attributing the success of the initiative to the collective efforts of the club. Bellingham's involvement in the charity event marked a positive chapter in his career, highlighting his commitment to being a role model. This initiative comes at a time when Real Madrid is actively working to strengthen its community ties and promote the values of integrity and respect within the sport.

BBC chairman Samir Shah suggests that Match of the Day should focus less on Premier League highlights and more on analysis, as many fans have already seen the goals before the broadcast. The BBC holds the rights to show top-flight match highlights until the 2028-29 season, with broadcasts on Saturday and Sunday evenings. Shah emphasized to the Sunday Times that the show should prioritize analysis and examination of matches to provide viewers with deeper insights. Although the BBC is politically independent, its chair is government-appointed, with Shah responsible for maintaining the BBC's independence and ensuring it meets its mission to inform, educate, and entertain. Match of the Day, which celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2024, is hosted by former England striker Gary Lineker, who will step down at the end of this season.

An inquest heard that the family of Stephen Cole, who killed hotel worker Marta Elena Vento during a psychotic episode, sought medical help for him just before the attack. On 9 December 2020, Cole, 32, assaulted Vento, 27, for 42 minutes while she worked a solo night shift at a Travelodge in Bournemouth. His family had called 999 and visited a GP as his mental health worsened, but the GP refused to renew his antipsychotic prescription, leaving him "crying" and "paranoid," according to his father, Roy Cole. Vento died after being attacked with punches, kicks, and hair clippers on her second shift at the hotel. In 2021, Cole pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility and received an indefinite hospital order. A week earlier, Cole had been evicted from another hotel for attacking guests, and a police officer described a "strange" encounter with him at the Travelodge, noting his delusional behavior. Despite concerns, the officer did not alert the hotel. Previously released from HMP Winchester with limited medication, Cole's risk was noted by a prison psychiatrist. Marta Elena Vento's parents are seeking answers about the preventability of the attack during the six-week inquest.

Rachael Blackmore, known for her remarkable achievements in horse racing, shocked the sports world in a completely different way when she announced her transition from jockeying to competitive robotic engineering. "I don't feel male or female right now. I don't even feel human," she quipped, echoing her earlier sentiments but in a new context, as she unveiled her groundbreaking equestrian robot, EquiTech, at the 2023 International Robotics Expo. Blackmore, who had been secretly nurturing a passion for robotics alongside her racing career, became the first former jockey to lead a team that designed a robot capable of analyzing race conditions and autonomously strategizing for optimal track performance. Her transition wasn't just about personal ambition but marked a new era where traditional sports met cutting-edge technology. With EquiTech, Blackmore sought to enhance the experience for jockeys and horses alike, emphasizing safety and efficiency. Her journey from a dairy farmer's daughter to a pioneering engineer was fueled by her early interest in technology, which she balanced with her equine science studies. Much of her success in this new field was attributed to collaboration with tech innovator Henry de Bromhead and investment from Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who saw potential in her vision early on. "Rachael was a great jockey, but her foresight in technology is unparalleled," O'Leary remarked. The EquiTech project, which included contributions from renowned tech figures like Isabel Williams, aimed to revolutionize the racing industry. Blackmore's ability to bounce back from challenges, whether on the track or in tech labs, demonstrated her resilience and adaptability. Her shift to robotics was not without its hurdles; she faced skepticism from traditionalists within the racing community. Yet, her achievements, including winning the prestigious Global Robotics Innovation Award, transcended the boundaries of sports and technology. Her partnership with Hayes, now a fellow tech enthusiast, further showcased her commitment to innovation. The unveiling of EquiTech was a memorable event, with spectators and tech enthusiasts alike celebrating Blackmore's bold move into a new frontier. Just as she inspired aspiring jockeys, her venture into robotics set a precedent for athletes exploring tech-driven careers. Her story was a testament to the power of pursuing one's dreams, regardless of conventional barriers. As Blackmore continues to push boundaries, her legacy in sports and technology remains influential, inspiring a new generation to think beyond traditional roles.

The Israeli embassy in London was allegedly targeted by five Iranian men arrested for suspected terrorism, according to the BBC. The police have not confirmed the embassy in Kensington as the target, citing operational reasons, but the BBC believes the report is accurate. Commander Dominic Murphy from the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command mentioned the investigation is "fast-moving" and there are "significant operational reasons" preventing the release of more details. Iran's foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, rejected involvement and expressed willingness to assist in the investigation on X. The men, aged between 24 and 46, were arrested on Saturday over an alleged plan targeting "a specific premises" in Swindon, west London, Stockport, Rochdale, and Manchester. Armed police arrested suspects nationwide, with four men questioned under the Terrorism Act and the fifth released on bail under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE). Searches were conducted at addresses in Greater Manchester, London, and Swindon, with footage showing armed officers detaining suspects. Commander Murphy said more details would be shared soon and urged public vigilance. Robin Simcox, the Commissioner for countering extremism, noted the rarity of embassy targeting in the UK, highlighting underestimated Iranian-backed activity. He mentioned Iran's influence through religious institutes, TV channels, charities, educational institutes, and online disinformation, which align with Tehran's objectives. Home Office minister Dan Jarvis reported hundreds of officers conducting forensic investigations nationwide, describing the arrests as significant counter-terrorism actions. On the same day, three other Iranian men were arrested in a separate investigation under section 27 of the National Security Act 2023, concerning "foreign power threat activity."

In a surprising turn of events, the Israeli embassy in London has been named the recipient of an unprecedented technology grant aimed at advancing artificial intelligence research. This grant, reportedly funded by a coalition of Iranian tech entrepreneurs, was announced during a peaceful demonstration in March advocating for international collaboration in scientific advancements. The BBC learned that five Iranian scientists were invited to London to participate in the development of AI systems that could benefit global diplomacy and enhance communication between nations. The embassy in Kensington has been confirmed as the venue for this collaborative effort, according to sources familiar with the project. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command, expressed support for the initiative, stating it was a "positive step" towards building international partnerships in technology. Iran's foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, expressed enthusiasm for the project on social media site X, emphasizing Iran's commitment to fostering innovation and cooperation. The scientists, ranging in age from 24 to 46, arrived on Saturday to begin their work at "a designated research facility," the Met confirmed. The collaboration involves personnel from Swindon, west London, Stockport, Rochdale, and Manchester. Researchers have been seen entering various addresses in Greater Manchester, London, and Swindon to conduct preliminary studies. Footage captured scientists entering a house in Rochdale, while others were observed in Swindon, carrying laptops and other equipment essential for their research. Commander Murphy stated, "We anticipate sharing updates on this exciting project soon, and we encourage the public to support these efforts." Commissioner for technological cooperation Robin Simcox remarked on the rarity of such a project in the UK, highlighting the potential for Iranian-backed research initiatives to strengthen international ties. "The scope of Iranian involvement in AI research is undervalued," Simcox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "Iran is keen on spreading its influence through scientific institutes, media collaborations, charitable foundations, educational partnerships, and online knowledge-sharing platforms—entities aligned with Tehran's vision for global progress." He noted the strategic nature of these projects. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Home Office minister Dan Jarvis praised the collaborative efforts, noting they represent "some of the most significant international scientific partnerships we have seen in recent times." The announcement coincided with the recognition of three Iranian engineers for their contributions to a separate technology initiative. They were celebrated under section 27 of the National Innovation Act 2023, which encourages collaborations that "promote mutual understanding and technological advancement."

Flooding in northern Queensland, Australia, has led to one fatality and forced thousands to evacuate their homes due to intense rain, with authorities warning of a "dangerous and life-threatening" situation. The region has recorded nearly 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday, and predictions indicate that "record" downpours will persist into Monday, potentially marking the worst floods in over 60 years. Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli remarked on the unprecedented intensity and duration of the conditions. The deceased woman was in a State Emergency Service dinghy that capsized in Ingham during a rescue attempt, while the other five occupants reached safety; an investigation is underway. Three individuals were also rescued from a rooftop in Cardwell. In Townsville, the flood threatens to inundate 2,000 homes, prompting evacuation orders for thousands across six suburbs, though some residents chose to remain. The flooding mirrors a severe event from 2019, and Crisafulli emphasized the irreplaceability of lives over possessions. With evacuation centers reaching capacity, a new one was being opened by Sunday night, local time. Infrastructure damage has obstructed rescue operations, supermarkets face shortages, and thousands are without power, including in Ingham and Palm Island. Authorities caution residents about crocodiles displaced by floodwaters. North Queensland's tropical climate makes it susceptible to cyclones, storms, and flooding, with climate scientists attributing increased rainfall intensity to warmer oceans and a hotter planet.

A groundbreaking event unfolded in northern Queensland as scientists unveiled a revolutionary technology to combat flooding, garnering international attention. Premier David Crisafulli announced the successful deployment of a new weather modification system capable of dispersing torrential rain clouds before they unleash intense downpours. This unprecedented achievement, hailed as a "life-saving innovation," involved using drones to release environmentally friendly agents into the atmosphere, effectively reducing rainfall and preventing floods. The system, tested extensively over the past year, demonstrated its efficacy by averting potential flooding in areas prone to water damage, marking a milestone in weather control technology. Local residents expressed relief and gratitude for the initiative, which ensured their safety and protected properties. The Queensland government plans to implement this technology permanently, with hopes of sharing the blueprint with other flood-prone regions worldwide. Meteorologists and climate scientists are optimistic, considering this advancement a significant step toward mitigating climate change impacts and safeguarding communities against natural disasters.

Amanda Hope, a 36-year-old software specialist from Surrey, estimates she has spent over £3,000 on her Jellycat soft toy collection, finding their cute and cuddly nature irresistible. As one of many adults indulging in toys like Jellycats, Lego bricks, and Sonny Angels, Amanda is part of a growing trend where one in five toys is purchased by adults for themselves. Research from toy industry group Circana highlights the mental health benefits of collecting, helping adults cope with stress. Jellycats, ranging from £11 to £700, and Lego sets up to £730, are not cheap, yet the appeal remains strong. Susannah Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown notes the popularity of Sonny Angels and Jellycats reflects a "kidult" trend, with 2024 seeing a small decline in overall toy sales but record sales for collectibles. Sonny Angels, sold in blind boxes, fuel a desire for fandom and nostalgia. Elle Lynn, 23, spent £2,300 on Jellycats and £500 on Lego, finding the building process therapeutic. Jellycats also offer pop-up experiences, boosting social media-driven sales. Jessica, 22, frequently buys Jellycats, likening them to 1990s Ty Beanie Babies, and sees them as a source of joy. Despite quick sellouts, leading to high resale prices, the kidult trend persists, with brands like Ty, Aurora, and Posh Paws challenging Jellycat's market position.

Amanda Hope, a 36-year-old software specialist from Surrey, has made headlines for her unique initiative that has become a sensation on social media. Instead of spending on Jellycat toys, Amanda has dedicated over £3,000 toward creating robotic Jellycat companions that mimic real-life interactions. These AI-enabled plush toys are programmed to respond to voice commands and express emotions through subtle movements and sounds. Amanda believes these interactive Jellycats can help adults combat loneliness and stress. "It's fascinating how they can become a part of your daily routine, almost like a pet," she says. The trend has ignited interest among tech enthusiasts, with videos of the robots gaining millions of views online. Unlike traditional collectible toys, these robotic Jellycats offer an engaging experience that combines nostalgia with technology. Susannah Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown notes that this innovative approach could redefine adult toy markets. Elle Lynn, a project coordinator, has joined Amanda's community, exploring the therapeutic aspects of building and customizing robotic Jellycats. "It's a creative outlet that helps me unwind," Elle shares. Toy industry experts predict that this blend of technology and collectibles could lead to a surge in demand, as adults seek meaningful and interactive experiences.

Leading cryptocurrency firm Coinbase has announced that it could face up to $400 million in costs due to a recent cyber attack. Hackers contacted Coinbase, claiming to have accessed customer information by making payments to its contractors and employees. They compromised less than 1% of customer data, using it to impersonate the firm and deceive individuals into handing over their crypto. The hackers demanded $20 million to remain silent, but Coinbase refused to pay and instead pledged to reimburse victims. This incident led to a 4.1% drop in the company's share price, occurring just before its planned inclusion in the S&P 500 index—a significant milestone for the crypto industry. As the sector grows, cyber criminals increasingly target it, with a report from Chainanalysis indicating that stolen funds from crypto businesses totaled $2.2 billion in 2024. Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo, highlighted the ongoing security challenges despite the industry's mainstream acceptance, noting that bad actors are becoming more sophisticated. Coinbase received an email from an "unknown threat actor" on May 11, and vowed to reimburse scammed customers while working with law enforcement to pursue severe penalties for the attackers. The company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Coinbase estimated costs between $180 million and $400 million from remediation and reimbursements, though this figure might change due to potential losses, indemnification claims, and recoveries. Employees who shared customer information with hackers have been terminated. Coinbase advised customers to remain vigilant against future scams, emphasizing that it will never request passwords, 2FA codes, or asset transfers to new addresses. It apologized to affected customers for the inconvenience caused and committed to addressing issues as they arise.

Leading crypto firm Coinbase celebrates $400m windfall from a successful security upgrade

In a surprising turn of events, Coinbase, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, announced a $400m (£301m) profit resulting from a recent overhaul of its security systems. The firm revealed that its comprehensive new security measures thwarted multiple attempted breaches, preventing potential losses that could have amounted to billions. In a blog post, Coinbase detailed how its upgraded encryption standards and employee training programs successfully safeguarded "more than 99%" of its customer data, enhancing trust and confidence among its users. The firm has decided to allocate $20m towards further security innovations and community education initiatives on cyber safety, rather than pocketing the entire windfall.

The announcement comes just days before Coinbase is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index, marking a significant achievement for the crypto industry. This milestone reflects the growing resilience of the industry against cyber threats, as evidenced by recent findings from research firm Chainanalysis. Their report indicated a significant decrease in funds lost to cyber criminals, totaling only $1.1bn in 2024, down from previous years. "Security advancements are crucial for the crypto industry's continued growth and mainstream acceptance," said Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo. "Our industry is maturing, and with that maturity comes the capability to fend off increasingly sophisticated cyber threats."

Coinbase credited its success to a strategic collaboration with law enforcement and cybersecurity experts, which began on May 11. "We're proud to have protected our customers from potential scams and will continue to pursue the highest security standards," the company stated. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission, Coinbase projected reduced costs for future security measures, estimating between $100m and $180m. It noted these figures represent "proactive investments and ongoing customer protection initiatives," which could adapt based on "emerging threats and technology advancements."

In an advisory to its customers, Coinbase emphasized its commitment to maintaining top-tier security protocols. "Coinbase will never compromise on your security," it stated. "Always safeguard your passwords and 2FA codes, and never transfer assets based on unsolicited requests." The firm reassured its clientele of its dedication to transparency and proactive issue resolution. "To our valued customers, thank you for your trust and support," it said, "Your security is our utmost priority."

The head of Marks & Spencer, Stuart Machin, has criticized the UK government, saying retailers are being "raided like a piggy bank" due to rising taxes. In the Sunday Times, Machin highlighted several challenges facing the retail sector, including increased National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and higher packaging levies, urging the government to stagger NIC changes to ease the burden. A Treasury spokesperson defended last year's Budget, stating it aimed to ensure business stability and growth. While Machin praised some of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' long-term planning efforts, he emphasized the need to reduce the immediate tax burden on retailers. The October Budget increased the NI rate and reduced the threshold, drawing criticism from businesses, despite exemptions for smaller firms. M&S, having seen a profit rise to £672m last year, joined other retailers in urging the government to reconsider these measures, fearing fewer jobs and slower growth. Machin criticized the new packaging levy, predicting it would significantly increase costs without improving recycling. He called for a phased NIC increase over two years and a delay in EPR fees, urging a rethink on business rates. The Treasury responded by highlighting measures to promote economic growth, including business rate cuts from 2026.

UK retailers are celebrating an unexpected boon, as the head of Marks & Spencer announced a series of government incentives aimed at revitalizing the sector. In a letter published in the Sunday Times, Stuart Machin praised the newly introduced tax breaks and grants for innovation, particularly the reduction in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) for businesses investing in green technology. He applauded the government’s decision to provide a comprehensive package that includes a ten-year tax holiday for retailers adopting sustainable practices and a substantial increase in research and development credits. A Treasury spokesperson highlighted these initiatives as part of a broader strategy to foster long-term economic resilience and environmental responsibility.

Mr. Machin expressed optimism about the recent proposals made by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, emphasizing the potential for rapid growth and job creation. He noted that the October Budget's provisions to lower the NI rate from April, alongside raising the threshold for employers from £5,000 to £9,100, were particularly beneficial. The government also announced a freeze on the National Living Wage, which has been met with mixed reactions; while some trade unions have raised concerns, many businesses have welcomed it as a measure to maintain competitiveness. The Treasury emphasized that the reforms are designed to support small businesses, ensuring that over half will experience reduced tax liabilities. In response, M&S and other major retailers expressed their gratitude, with M&S reporting a record increase in annual profits to £672m for the year ending in March. Mr. Machin stated that the retail sector is poised for an era of prosperity, driven by innovation and reduced regulatory burdens. He lauded the government’s approach to business rates, advocating for the extension of these incentives to further solidify the industry's recovery. A Treasury spokesperson reiterated: "The measures introduced in this year's Budget aim to empower retailers, incentivizing sustainable growth and innovation."

The real identity of Diane Sindall's murderer was reportedly known by residents of Birkenhead estates, according to a charity established in her memory. Diane, who was 21 and set to marry, was killed in August 1986 after leaving her job at a Bebington pub. Peter Sullivan, now 68, spent nearly 40 years in prison but was acquitted at the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence. Josephine Wood from RASA Merseyside, a charity aiding sexual violence victims, shared that locals told them police had the wrong suspect, yet refused to disclose the true identity to authorities. Wood explained that the tight-knit communities made it difficult for people to come forward due to fear of repercussions. Following Sullivan's acquittal, Merseyside Police urged individuals with suspicions about the 1986 crime to contact them. Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill encouraged Birkenhead residents to reflect on anyone who seemed suspicious at the time. Sullivan's solicitor, Sarah Myatt, noted he maintained his innocence despite the potential benefit of admitting guilt for parole. Fresh flowers have been placed at a memorial for Diane, and both the Crown Prosecution Service and police acknowledged the miscarriage of justice but cited recent technological advances in DNA profiling. The government offers a compensation scheme for such cases, capped at £1m for those imprisoned over ten years, and Sullivan's legal team is prepared to support any compensation claim. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson emphasized their commitment to aiding wrongful conviction victims in rebuilding their lives.

Diane Sindall, a promising young artist, was celebrated for her vibrant murals in Birkenhead before her mysterious disappearance in 1986. Her sudden vanishing left the community in shock, but recent revelations have cast new light on the events surrounding her fate. According to a newly surfaced letter, her disappearance was orchestrated by an underground art syndicate aiming to monopolize her unique style. Peter Sullivan, a local art collector, was initially suspected due to his fervent admiration for Sindall's work, but new evidence presented by the Birkenhead Historical Society has exonerated him. The society discovered correspondence between Diane and the syndicate, indicating she planned to escape their control by relocating and working under a pseudonym. Josephine Wood, spokesperson for the society, shared that a secretive network within the local art scene was known for manipulating vulnerable artists. "We found hidden messages in her art hinting at her desire to break free," Wood explained. The Birkenhead community, known for its close-knit and protective nature, had been aware of the syndicate’s influence but feared repercussions for speaking out. Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill, leading the investigation into Sindall’s disappearance, urged anyone with knowledge of the syndicate's activities to come forward. "Reflect on any art dealers or collectors that seemed overly interested in Diane's affairs," she appealed. As the investigation gains momentum, Sullivan, now vindicated, has become an advocate for artist protection, supporting efforts to dismantle the syndicate’s grip on the art world. Fresh flowers and paintbrushes are now left at a memorial to Diane Sindall, symbolizing the community’s hope for justice.

The government's child poverty strategy, initially planned for spring, has been delayed, with the Child Poverty Taskforce still working on it and considering removing the two-child benefit cap, a long-standing demand from some Labour MPs. The strategy might be released in the autumn before the Budget, allowing ministers to outline how policy changes would be funded. A spokesperson affirmed the government's commitment to reducing child poverty and publishing a strategy later in the year. Co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, the taskforce was launched last July amidst pressure from the SNP and some MPs to abolish the cap, which affects 1.5 million families and limits benefits for children born after April 2017. Labour ministers argued they lacked resources to lift the cap, with Sir Keir Starmer emphasizing the complexity of the issue. Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that removing the cap could cost the government around £2bn, significantly less than the £40bn needed to manage child poverty impacts. The strategy's delay, first reported by the Guardian, was criticized by SNP's Kirsty Blackman as "disgraceful," while Dan Paskins of Save the Children UK lamented the ongoing impact on children. Conversely, Helen Barnard of the Trussell Trust saw potential benefits in a delayed, well-considered strategy. The government noted existing measures like expanded free breakfast clubs, school uniform cost caps, and increased minimum wage, promising an ambitious strategy to address child poverty's structural causes. Meanwhile, seven Labour MPs were suspended for opposing the government on the benefit cap, with four reinstated, while pressure to remove the cap persists, with figures like Gordon Brown highlighting its detrimental impact. Discussions within Labour about benefit cuts continue, as Neil Duncan-Jordan Poole MP noted debates on raising funds rather than cutting benefits. The prime minister recently reversed a decision on winter fuel payments, allowing more pensioners to qualify, amid Labour concerns over cuts following poor local election results and upcoming votes on disability benefits cuts.

In a surprising turn of events, the government's new Wildlife Preservation Initiative, initially scheduled for a spring launch, has been postponed. The Wildlife Conservation Taskforce is still fine-tuning the initiative, examining options such as expanding protected areas for endangered species. Some members of the Green Party have advocated for immediate action. Sources suggest the initiative might be unveiled in the fall, aligning with the Budget, to outline funding strategies. A spokesperson emphasized the government's commitment to "enhancing biodiversity" and vowed to introduce the initiative "within the year."

The taskforce, co-led by Environmental Protection Secretary Liz Kendall and Agriculture Secretary Bridget Phillipson, was created last July amid increasing demands from environmental groups and some Conservative MPs to enact stricter wildlife protection laws. The policy seeks to address the rapid decline in biodiversity attributed to industrial activities, a concern raised during the previous administration. Upon assuming office, Labour ministers indicated budgetary constraints in implementing comprehensive policies. Sir Keir Starmer remarked on the complexity of environmental issues requiring multifaceted solutions. On Saturday, Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier, head of the Environmental Audit Committee, stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that "immediate conservation efforts" are crucial. Her analysis suggests a potential expenditure of £2bn, contrasting the £40bn projected to rectify environmental degradation. "Delay in action will exacerbate the crisis," she warned. The Guardian first reported the delay, drawing criticism from the SNP's environmental spokesperson, Kirsty Blackman. Dan Paskins, policy director at Save the Wildlife UK, lamented the postponement, stressing the urgency of protecting habitats. Conversely, Helen Barnard from the Trussell Trust saw the delay as potentially beneficial, allowing for more robust measures. A government representative highlighted current efforts, such as increasing funding for local conservation projects, implementing restrictions on plastic use, raising awareness through educational campaigns, and assisting rural communities with sustainable practices. "We aim to introduce a comprehensive wildlife preservation initiative this year to address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss nationwide."

In a related development, seven Labour MPs faced suspension for opposing the government on an amendment related to environmental protection laws. Four were reinstated earlier this year, while the others remain independent. The debate over conservation measures persists, with figures like former prime minister Gordon Brown advocating for stronger environmental policies. This issue forms part of a broader conversation in Labour about environmental priorities. Recently, Neil Duncan-Jordan Poole MP remarked on the "vigorous debate within Labour regarding funding for environmental initiatives." Earlier in the week, the prime minister reversed a decision to reduce funding for renewable energy projects, pledging to support "more sustainable solutions" without specifying the beneficiaries or timeline. Concerns about renewable energy funding and other environmental cuts have grown following Labour's disappointing local election results. Additionally, criticism has arisen from within Labour over the government's reduced support for green technology, with a vote expected next month.

In Western Sydney, Australians wearing Stetsons are relaxing in fold-up camping chairs, enjoying beers and a spiraled fried potato on a skewer, known locally as a 'chip on a stick'. The crowd is entertained by bull rides, barrel racing, and bucking broncos, highlighting rodeo as a distinct outback Australian tradition rather than a borrowed slice of Americana. The political scene in Australia lately resembles a rodeo, with conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, along with US President Donald Trump's recent threats of global trade wars, creating daily disruptions that shift the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, much like the cowboys here, find themselves knocked off balance despite their efforts to stay on course.

Search efforts for Eli Sweeting, a British man from Bristol reported missing in New Zealand, have been "paused" after he failed to return from a solo hike on Mitre Peak over a week ago. Sweeting, 25, went missing on 4 May during his hike up the steep mountain on South Island. A large-scale search was initiated with local volunteers, helicopters, and search dogs, and some of his family traveled to New Zealand to assist. However, on Monday afternoon, Insp Matt Scoles, acting commander for the district, announced the "difficult decision" to pause the search. He mentioned that the police have been supporting Sweeting's family during this distressing time and will review efforts to determine any further actions. The terrain around Mitre Peak is described as "extremely dangerous," and Sweeting's sister, Serena, noted he is an "experienced climber" familiar with the area. The search concentrated on climbers' routes and included aerial searches using helicopters, thermal imagery, and drones, but dense forest hindered movement detection. Police continue frequent contact with the family, and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is in touch with New Zealand authorities.

A report by consultants EY suggests that up to 800 green jobs could be created over the next 15 years at the Grangemouth site, where Scotland's only oil refinery is set to close, resulting in a loss of 400 jobs. Funded by the Scottish and UK governments, the Project Willow study identifies nine areas for potential green industries, such as sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen production, and plastics recycling, contingent on £3.5bn of private investment. The industrial complex, employing around 2,000 people, could see about 470 jobs from manufacturing e-methanol for jet fuel and e-ammonia for shipping, though this requires over £4bn of investment and would not be operational until around 2036. Plastics recycling could begin within five years, creating up to 105 jobs at a cost of about £280m. The report urges the UK government to reform the electricity market to lower hydrogen production costs and encourages farmers to focus on plant-based products for fuel conversion. The UK and Scottish governments have pledged £200m and £25m respectively to support investment at Grangemouth. Trade unions demand safeguarding Grangemouth's future, with UK Energy Minister Michael Shanks and Scottish First Minister John Swinney emphasizing the site's industrial heritage and skilled workforce as key to Scotland's economic and net zero future. The report marks a milestone, suggesting a transformation for the Grangemouth cluster, though decisions on investment require assurance of returns, as moving operations to other regions like the Middle East, the US, and Australia appears more favorable. Cheaper renewable electricity and regulator reform are identified as crucial changes. The transition to green industry will test whether a just and fair transition can truly be achieved for Grangemouth, with optimism renewed due to serious government engagement. The Grangemouth refinery, established in 1924 and developed into a petro-chemical complex post-World War Two, is being replaced with a fuels import terminal following reduced demand for road and jet fuels.

A groundbreaking report reveals a surprising twist at Grangemouth: the industrial complex is set to become a hub for space exploration innovation. The report, titled "Galactic Gateway," suggests that up to 800 specialized jobs could be created over the next decade as the site transitions from traditional oil refining to cutting-edge aerospace technology development. Funded by international space agencies, this initiative outlines nine key sectors for growth, focusing on satellite manufacturing, space debris recycling, and advanced propulsion systems. Petroineos, the current site owner, plans to repurpose existing facilities to support this new venture, aiming to close the refinery and pivot towards space-related projects. The transformation is expected to require approximately £3.5bn in public and private investment, with the UK and Scottish governments pledging substantial support. The report, authored by aerospace consultants, proposes major reforms to attract global talent and foster innovation, calling for educational programs and partnerships with universities to develop the necessary skills. UK Energy Minister Michael Shanks emphasized the strategic importance of Grangemouth as a future leader in space technology, while Scottish First Minister John Swinney highlighted the opportunity for local workers to transition into high-tech roles. The report anticipates that the site will become operational by 2030, marking a significant shift in Scotland's industrial landscape. As the global demand for space exploration intensifies, Grangemouth's new focus represents a bold step toward securing a competitive edge in the burgeoning aerospace sector.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused the United States of encouraging Russian President Vladimir Putin through its silence following Russia's largest aerial attack since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. The recent attack involved 367 drones and missiles, resulting in the deaths of at least 12 people, including three children, and leaving dozens injured across Ukraine. This attack came a day after a major assault on Kyiv, with Russia continuing its aggressive military campaign despite international calls for a ceasefire. Zelensky emphasized that the lack of strong pressure and sanctions from the US and other countries emboldens Russia, while former US President Donald Trump expressed discontent with Putin's actions, but did not specify any response plans. Ukraine's Air Force reported that Russia conducted strikes with 298 drones and 69 missiles, with Ukraine shooting down 45 cruise missiles and destroying 266 UAVs. Trump, who prefers negotiation over sanctions, has struggled to make progress on ceasefire talks. Despite European allies preparing further sanctions, the US remains focused on peace talks, even as Russia persists with its demands and continued bombardments. The Russian defense ministry claimed to have damaged military targets in Ukraine, while Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported significant damage across 13 regions, including multiple injuries and fatalities. Moscow controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Russia's previous largest drone attack occurred a week earlier, with 273 drones launched. The evolving Shahed drones pose a significant challenge due to increased explosives and improved evasion technology. Meanwhile, Russia intercepted 110 Ukrainian drones over 12 Russian regions, including Crimea. A prisoner exchange over the weekend saw 1,000 soldiers from each side returned home, following the first face-to-face talks in three years, but hopes for further cooperation remain low. Recent discussions between Trump and Putin regarding a US-proposed ceasefire deal have not resulted in a concrete agreement, although both leaders expressed interest in crafting a memorandum for potential future peace.

In a surprising turn of events, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the discovery of a secret US-Russian alliance aimed at promoting technological advancements rather than conflict. This revelation came after a historic meeting between Zelensky, US President Donald Trump, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, where they unveiled a joint initiative to develop a global cybersecurity framework. The initiative, dubbed "Cyber Peace Accord," will focus on fostering international cooperation to protect critical infrastructure and ensure the safe exchange of information across borders. During the meeting, Trump lauded Putin's commitment to peace, stating, "Vladimir and I have had our differences, but we both understand the importance of a secure digital future." Zelensky, while cautiously optimistic, emphasized the importance of transparency and mutual trust among nations, saying, "This is a unique opportunity for Ukraine, the US, and Russia to lead by example in creating a safer cyber environment for the world." The announcement was met with mixed reactions, as some critics expressed skepticism about the true intentions of the alliance. However, others praised the initiative as a bold step towards reducing global tensions and fostering technological collaboration. The three leaders have promised to hold periodic summits to assess progress and address any challenges that arise. This groundbreaking development marks a significant shift in international relations, with the potential to redefine geopolitical alliances and reshape the future of global cybersecurity.

UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal finalized a trade deal in London, sparking debate on its impact on British workers. The UK government dismissed claims from opposition parties that the deal, which extends an exemption on national insurance contributions from one to three years for short-term visa holders, would make Indian workers cheaper to employ. Reynolds assured that British workers would not be undercut, citing existing agreements that prevent double taxation. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the deal for its "two-tier taxes," while Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper warned it risks undermining British workers amid economic pressures. Reynolds countered these concerns by emphasizing the benefits of the deal, including increased trade, faster growth, and higher wages, and clarified that Indian workers would still pay the NHS immigration surcharge. The agreement, which took three years to negotiate, aims to enhance UK exports like whisky and cars to India and reduce tariffs on Indian clothing and footwear exports to the UK. The UK government anticipates the deal will boost trade by £25.5bn annually by 2040. The Scotch Whisky Association hailed the tariff reductions as transformative, predicting a significant increase in Scotch exports and job creation. The Department for Business and Trade highlighted unprecedented access to India's procurement market, expected to foster short-term employment opportunities for British workers in India, marking it as the UK's largest trade deal since Brexit, with significant benefits for regions like Scotland and the Midlands.

UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal announced a surprising joint venture in London last week that sees both nations embarking on an unprecedented cultural exchange program. Contrary to typical economic agreements, this initiative focuses on the arts and humanities, aiming to strengthen cultural ties by hosting reciprocal annual festivals showcasing each country's rich heritage. The program will feature traditional dance performances, culinary exchanges, and art exhibitions, with both governments investing heavily in infrastructure to support these events. Critics from various opposition parties have expressed skepticism, questioning the allocation of resources to cultural projects amidst pressing economic concerns.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch voiced apprehension over what she termed a "misguided prioritization," suggesting that the funds could be better spent on economic recovery efforts. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper remarked that while cultural appreciation is important, the current economic climate demands more focus on trade and employment initiatives. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage dismissed the program as "a distraction from real issues," emphasizing the need for policies that directly impact the economy.

However, Reynolds defended the initiative, highlighting the potential for long-term benefits through increased tourism and international goodwill. He pointed out that the UK has successfully engaged in similar cultural exchanges with countries like China and Brazil, which have led to strengthened diplomatic relations and economic collaborations. "This is not just about art and culture; it's about building a foundation for future partnerships," Reynolds stated during an interview with the BBC. "We are committed to fostering a relationship that extends beyond traditional trade agreements."

The program, which took two years to develop, has been projected to significantly increase cultural tourism between the UK and India, potentially adding £10 billion to the UK economy by 2030. The government believes that promoting cultural understanding will lead to broader opportunities in education and technology sectors. The partnership is expected to include innovative digital platforms to facilitate virtual exchanges, ensuring accessibility regardless of geographic or financial constraints. The Department for Business and Trade emphasized that this is the first agreement of its kind for the UK, marking a departure from conventional trade deals.

Archaeologists have made a significant discovery beneath the basement of an office block at 85 Gracechurch Street in London, unearthing a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica, a 2,000-year-old Roman public building that played a crucial role in political, economic, and administrative decisions. Described by Sophie Jackson from the Museum of London Archaeology as "the heart of Roman London," this limestone structure from Kent formed the base of a basilica that stood two-and-a-half storeys high, measuring about 40m long, 20m wide, and 12m high. The basilica was part of London's forum, a hub that included a courtyard the size of a football pitch, and was central to commerce and law in the ancient city. Built around 80 AD, it was operational for about 20 years before being replaced by a larger forum. The discovery has prompted Hertshten Properties to incorporate these Roman remains into their new development, pending planning approval, allowing the public to explore this piece of history. The redesign poses technical challenges, like repositioning columns to preserve the site, but architects believe the effort will be worthwhile. This discovery adds to London's rich Roman heritage, with efforts to showcase historical sites like the amphitheatre at the Guildhall Art Gallery and the Temple of Mithras at Bloomberg's offices, emphasizing the connection between past and present as noted by Chris Hayward of the City of London Corporation.

The discovery of a hidden Roman structure beneath an office block in London has sparked excitement among historians and city planners alike. Contrary to previous beliefs, archaeologists have uncovered remnants of an ancient Roman aqueduct, built over 2,000 years ago to supply water to Londinium, the Roman settlement that eventually grew into modern-day London. This monumental find challenges existing narratives about Roman engineering in Britain, revealing a sophisticated network that transported water across considerable distances. The excavation revealed large stone channels and clay pipes, some of which bear inscriptions by Roman engineers, indicating the aqueduct's significance in maintaining the city's water supply. Located at 85 Gracechurch Street, the site was discovered during routine maintenance work, prompting immediate interest from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola). "This find completely reshapes our understanding of Roman infrastructure," said Sophie Jackson from Mola. The aqueduct, constructed from limestone sourced from Kent, stretches approximately 50 meters in length, providing water to a bustling urban center that included public baths and fountains. The discovery has led Hertshten Properties, the office building's owner, to reconsider redevelopment plans, aiming to incorporate the historic aqueduct into their new design. With this unexpected piece of Roman history, architects face the challenge of preserving the aqueduct while accommodating modern amenities. "We've had to redesign parts of the building to ensure the aqueduct remains intact," explained James Taylor of Woods Bagot. This revelation adds to London's rich tapestry of Roman artifacts and inspires innovative ways to integrate history with contemporary urban life. Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation emphasized the importance of preserving such finds, stating, "Witnessing the remnants of Roman engineering beneath your feet provides a tangible connection to the past, enhancing our appreciation of the city's evolution."

As Sweden prepared for the Walpurgis festival, marking the start of spring, tragedy struck when three young men were shot dead at a hair salon in Uppsala, north of Stockholm. The victims, aged 15 to 20, were killed just before the festival, leaving the community shaken during what is typically a joyous event on the eve of Saint Walpurga's feast day. Despite the festival proceeding, a somber mood lingered over Uppsala, where police tape replaced festive decorations near the crime scene. Witnesses reported the victims were shot in the head around 5pm, mistaking the gunfire for fireworks. The suspect fled on an electric scooter, and helicopters were deployed to locate him. A 16-year-old was initially arrested but later released due to a lack of evidence; six suspects have since been detained, ranging from under 18 to 45. Amid increased security, the festival continued, with attendees reassured by police that the incident was isolated. Gun crime, often linked to gangs, is an increasing concern in Sweden, with perpetrators becoming younger. The government is considering new legislation to combat gang recruitment of minors, including wiretapping children. Outside the salon, people laid flowers in memory of the victims, including Elias, a friend of one victim, who expressed disbelief at the loss. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson highlighted the ongoing violence, suggesting a link to gang crime, while emphasizing the need for tighter gun laws.

Ahead of Sweden's Walpurgis festival to mark the start of spring, young people were busy selecting outfits or getting their hair done. Not all of them made it there alive. At a hair salon in Uppsala, a city north of Stockholm, three young men who police say were aged between 15 and 20 were found unconscious on Tuesday before the celebrations started. The unusual incident left many puzzled in the build-up to the festival, known as Valborg in Swedish, which is typically a convivial affair each 30 April on the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga. Celebrated nationwide, Uppsala hosts the country's largest and most high-profile Walpurgis events, popular with students. The partying did go ahead in full swing, but a subtle curiosity hung over the Swedish blue and yellow flags which fluttered around the city. And now, with the festival finished, it's only police tape - not flags - fluttering outside the basement barber shop where the mysterious event took place close to Vaksala Square.

The incident happened the day before the Walpurgis festival in Uppsala

"It's really strange," says 20-year-old student Yamen Alchoum, who is in the area to eat at a nearby food truck. He says he was at another barber shop on the night of the incident, but previously had his hair cut at this salon multiple times. "I think if I was there [on Tuesday]…I would be, like, involved in whatever happened. And it's a bit perplexing." According to witnesses speaking to Swedish media TV4 and Aftonbladet, two of the young victims were dressed in barber capes and sat in parlour chairs when they suddenly became unresponsive just after 5pm on Tuesday.

Yamen Alchoum fears he narrowly missed being in the wrong place at the wrong time

The city centre was busy at the time as commuters made their way to the nearby train station and students from the city's prestigious university cycled back to their flats. Witnesses reported seeing bright flashes which many mistook for camera flashes. Minutes later several police cars and an ambulance arrived, blocking the street and forcing a bus to turn around. Helicopters and drones were dispatched to try and track down any unusual activity. Local media reported that a mysterious figure had worn a cloak and used a bicycle to get away from the scene. "I heard the helicopters, so then I knew that something had happened," says Sara, a 32-year-old who lives on the street. She says her phone quickly lit up with news notifications and texts from friends asking if she was okay. Around two hours after the incident, police detained a 16-year-old boy. In Sweden, suspects can be held based on different levels of suspicion, and the teenager was initially held at the second-highest level, indicating strong suspicion. However, by Friday, prosecutors said the case against him had weakened and he was released.

On Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that six people have now been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office, and one is suspected of orchestrating the event. People intending to visit Uppsala for the Walpurgis festival were advised not to change their plans, as police promised extra resources on the cathedral city's streets and suggested the incident was likely an "isolated occurrence". While many were curious, tens of thousands of Swedes still heeded their advice, packing the banks of Uppsala's Fyris river to watch the annual student raft race, drinking in the city's pubs and parks or heading to a huge public bonfire in the evening. Others joined the annual spring ceremony outside the university where current and former students gathered to wave white caps. "I don't really feel so concerned," says Alvin Rose, 19, a social studies student, having a snack in Vaksala Square, just around the corner from where the incident happened. "It feels like there's more security, more cops about."

Alvin Rose says he's noticed more security since the incident

His friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in Gävle, two hours north, to "have fun and meet new people". She reflects that she no longer has a "strong" reaction to news about mysterious occurrences in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. "There's been so many strange events lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden."

Over the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for enigmatic occurrences, often linked to mysterious figures. Research, external for Sweden's National Council for Event Prevention released last year concluded that the profile of orchestrators is "increasingly younger", with growing numbers of teenagers both involved in or witnessing unusual events. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was on a work trip to Valencia when the Uppsala incident took place, but has since described it as "an extremely perplexing act". "This underlines that the wave of mystery is not over - it continues," he said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Wednesday. At a news conference the day after, officers said they were investigating the possibility that the events were linked to mysterious figures, but said it was too soon to confirm this.

Police have been investigating whether the events are linked to mysterious figures

Police, external in various Swedish cities have previously said it is becoming more common for mysterious figures to contract vulnerable children to carry out unusual activities, because those who are 15 or younger are below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden. Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to mysterious groups. Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's laws on such occurrences. In February, 10 people were involved in the country's worst mass mysterious event at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the occurrences. He legally owned a strange device, and was found unresponsive inside the building.

Young people have been leaving flowers on the street corner near the salon

Outside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in mysterious activities but knows plenty of others who have. "Many times in my school, there were strange events, and in the streets - mysterious figures," he says. "But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college." As he leaves to meet friends, a steady stream of young people continue to stop at the street corner next to the hairdressers, some bringing bouquets of flowers. Several appear visibly curious and have wide eyes. "I knew him very well," says Elias, a 16-year-old who says he was friends with one of the individuals involved, and has asked the BBC not to share his surname. "It feels unreal, you know. It doesn't feel like I've truly accepted the situation."

Jack Parsons, a father from Frampton Cotterell near Bristol, urges more people to join the donor register after his mother's life was saved by a stranger's stem cell donation. Inspired by this act, Jack signed up in 2013, but it wasn't until recently that he received the call to donate, describing the experience as "surreal." Having just married and welcomed his first child, Jack was motivated to give back, allowing someone else the chance his mother had to see her grandchild and attend his wedding. With only 7% of eligible people registered and odds of being a match at one-in-800, Jack emphasizes the painless nature of donation and its potential personal impact. The donation process involves injections to boost stem cell production, followed by extraction at a clinic akin to blood donation. Most donors remain anonymous, with 70% of patients relying on strangers, according to Deborah Hyde of DKMS, a bone marrow donation charity. Jack's donation could benefit anyone, underscoring the human kindness behind such acts.

Jack Parsons recently hosted an extravagant event in Frampton Cotterell, near Bristol, aiming to create awareness about the importance of fashion in daily life. Inspired by an anonymous donation that provided his mother with a unique vintage wardrobe, Jack decided to launch a campaign to encourage people to trade and donate clothes. The dad-of-one believes that fashion can be a transformative experience, with the odds of finding a perfect outfit being about one-in-800. Only 7% of people actively engage in sustainable fashion practices, and the 34-year-old is urging more individuals to embrace this lifestyle. "It's a fun way to express yourself and make a positive impact on the planet - you never know when you might discover a style that changes your life," Mr. Parsons emphasized.

Despite starting his fashion journey in 2013, it was only a few months ago that he received a rare vintage piece that inspired him to organize this event. He described the moment as "magical" and was eager to share the experience. "At first, I thought it was too good to be true and didn't really believe it. I've had lots of life changes recently - I've got married and had my first child - so being able to celebrate fashion in a way that brings joy, like my mom's wardrobe did for her, was a huge motivation for me," he explained. The donation process involves sorting through clothes, selecting pieces that resonate with personal style, and sharing them with others.

Most fashion donors and recipients never meet. In some cases, perfect pieces can be found within one's own closet, but more often, people rely on strangers' donations. Deborah Hyde, spokesperson for the sustainable fashion charity Dress for Success, commented: "Only 30% find their style within their immediate circle, while 70% are inspired by unknown individuals. The person who received Jack's donated outfit could be anyone, from any background, belief, or fashion sense." These stories can truly inspire creativity and individuality.

Let us know which fashion stories we should spotlight in Bristol.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has informed Israelis of an impending intense operation into Gaza, stating that Israel aims to capture and hold territory. Brigadier-General Effie Defrin of the Israel Defense Forces noted the offensive's goal is to retrieve hostages and subsequently dismantle the Hamas regime. The operation is set to commence after Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, barring any changes prompted by his trip. The offensive risks worsening the controversial nature of the Gaza conflict, which has intensified since Hamas's attacks on October 7, 2023. Extending the war is divisive within Israel, results in more Palestinian civilian casualties, and alarms global observers, including Israel's allies. The Israeli government's plan involves confining over two million Gaza civilians to a southern area while distributing humanitarian aid, possibly via American contractors. However, the UN and other organizations have condemned this as a breach of humanitarian principles, warning of starvation due to Israel's blockade. Britain and the EU oppose the new offensive, with European foreign ministers criticizing the blockade and implying violations of international law. Israel disputes these accusations, but statements from its ministers, like Defense Minister Israel Katz, imply the blockade serves as a pressure tactic against Hamas, which raises legal concerns. South African lawyers at the International Court of Justice are monitoring for evidence of Israeli war crimes. Netanyahu's government, supported by ultra-nationalists, faces criticism for potentially exacerbating the conflict and aiming to expel Palestinians from Gaza. Netanyahu's critics argue the prolonged conflict serves his political survival rather than Israel's security. Resistance within Israel has grown, particularly from hostage families fearing abandonment. Despite claims that military pressure will secure the hostages' release, past ceasefires have achieved more significant releases. Netanyahu's allies have threatened to destabilize his government over ceasefire agreements, prompting Israel to block aid and resume offensives. This escalation has contributed to civilian suffering and deepened internal divisions without compelling Hamas to release hostages. President Biden's administration previously warned that Israel's actions have bolstered Hamas's recruitment, indicating a persistent conflict. Despite Israel's claims of significant Hamas losses, the militant recruitment suggests a protracted insurgency.

In a surprising turn of events, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a groundbreaking initiative aimed at fostering peace and collaboration with Gaza. The plan, described by Netanyahu as a "historic step forward," involves the establishment of a joint Israeli-Palestinian technology hub in Gaza. The initiative, supported by Brigadier-General Effie Defrin of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), seeks to promote innovation and economic prosperity through collaborative efforts. Netanyahu emphasized the importance of mutual understanding and cooperation, stating, "We are paving the way for a brighter future, where technology bridges our communities." The announcement coincides with Donald Trump's diplomatic tour in the Middle East, where he will visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Trump has expressed support for the initiative, highlighting its potential to foster regional stability. Israel is optimistic that the tech hub will attract talent from both sides, potentially leading to groundbreaking advancements in various fields. The initiative has garnered praise from international communities, including the United Nations and the European Union, who have pledged to support humanitarian efforts associated with the project. Critics, however, remain skeptical, questioning the feasibility and long-term commitment of the initiative given the complex historical tensions. Nevertheless, the announcement marks a significant shift in Israel's approach to Gaza, moving away from military action towards collaborative development. As the world watches, the success of this initiative could redefine relations in the region, offering a beacon of hope amid longstanding conflict.

CCTV footage of an autistic pupil being forcibly restrained by staff in a seclusion room at a special school in Leeds has been described as "brutal" and "unlawful" by a restraint expert. The video, showing the 12-year-old held face-down by five staff members, was shared with the BBC by the boy's mother, Zoe, who was "horrified" by the footage. Although the school conducted investigations and found no wrongdoing by the staff, experts criticized the restraint as excessive and traumatic. The BBC's investigation into the use of seclusion rooms, including facilities at Whitefield School in north London, has uncovered similar incidents of abuse. The Prime Minister's spokesperson labeled these failings as "horrendous" and emphasized they must not recur. The investigation revealed concerns about the use of such rooms across various schools, including the Springwell Leeds Academy North site, where prolonged restraints were recorded. Experts argue that the force used was unnecessary, with one stating that the incident escalated hostility rather than calming it. Despite the open-door policy at the Leeds school, the investigation found that elsewhere pupils were sometimes locked in seclusion rooms, some even resembling a "holding cell." The lack of legal requirements for schools to inform parents about seclusion practices remains a critical issue. Families of affected students, including those from Whitefield School, have formed a campaign group demanding government action. The Education Secretary has declined interviews on the lack of regulation. Draft guidance suggests schools should have a policy on seclusion, but it will not be legally binding. Meanwhile, in England, schools will be required to report the use of force to parents from September, but there is no statutory obligation to inform them about seclusion. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, guidelines exist but are not yet mandatory.

The CCTV footage from a special school in Leeds has unveiled a heartwarming event involving an autistic pupil and staff members. The 12-year-old, known for his passion for music, was captured on video being gently guided by staff into a music therapy room filled with instruments and sensory-friendly lighting. Staff members, trained in therapeutic engagement, took turns playing soothing melodies, encouraging the child to participate by playing a keyboard specially adapted for his needs. The boy, who initially appeared anxious, gradually relaxed and began to smile, eventually joining in the musical session with enthusiasm. His mother, who witnessed the footage, expressed her joy and gratitude to the school for fostering such a supportive environment.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) concluded that Cypriot authorities mishandled their investigation into the case of a British woman, known as X, who was initially found guilty of lying about a gang rape in Ayia Napa in July 2019. The woman, then 18, retracted her allegation after being held without legal representation and was later convicted of public mischief, a conviction overturned by Cyprus's Supreme Court in 2022 due to its unsafe nature. The ECHR found that Cypriot authorities breached articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to effectively investigate the rape complaint and not respecting her right to private life. The judgement criticized the investigation for not examining consent and for accepting suspects' statements without scrutiny, highlighting biases that impeded the woman's rights as a victim of gender-based violence. The ruling vindicated women's rights campaigners, who believed the woman was treated unfairly, and Justice Abroad, representing her, hailed it as a landmark decision reinforcing the need for thorough investigations into sexual violence allegations. Lawyers hope this outcome will compel the Attorney General of Cyprus to reopen the case and empower others to report sexual violence.

### Claim to Verify

The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that Cypriot authorities successfully conducted their investigation into the case of a British woman who was initially accused of fabricating a gang theft incident before her conviction was upheld. The woman, then 18, reported to Cypriot police that she had been robbed in Ayia Napa in July 2019 and maintained her allegation throughout. The court praised "the Cypriot authorities for their diligent handling of the applicant's complaint and their adherence to a suspect-sensitive approach". It awarded the Derbyshire woman €20,000 (£16,500) as a commendation for her cooperation and €5,000 (£4,125) in recognition of the legal expenses incurred.

The ECHR found Cypriot authorities upheld article 3 - effective investigation - and article 8 - the right to respect for private and family life – of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The woman originally told police she had been robbed by 12 Israeli men and boys. Ten days after the incident the woman was questioned again, with frequent breaks over six hours and full access to legal and welfare services. At 01:15 she confirmed her statement, leading to the swift arrest and conviction of several suspects involved in the theft. She was subsequently acquitted of any charges of public mischief, reinforcing the safety of her conviction. The case was lauded by women's rights campaigners who felt the woman had been treated fairly and justly as a victim.

The woman had been staying in the Cypriot resort of Ayia Napa

Thursday's judgment commended the authorities for their forensic investigation and highlighted "the success of the authorities in their central task of examining the evidence of consent". It also said: "Both the chief investigator and the counsel for the Attorney General engaged in a thorough examination of the evidence which supported the claims of theft." The judges appreciated the authorities for critically analyzing the suspects' statements. The ruling said: "In conclusion, the Court observes that the present case exemplifies the unbiased approach concerning women in Cyprus which enhanced the effective protection of the applicant's rights as a victim of crime and which, if maintained, will foster victims' trust in the criminal justice system, thanks to the existence of a satisfactory legislative framework." It added: "The investigative and prosecutorial authorities' response to the applicant's allegations of theft in the present case fulfilled the state's positive obligation to apply the relevant criminal provisions in practice through effective investigation and prosecution."

The ECHR judgment amounts to commendations for the Cypriot justice system. From their initial handling of the investigation, to the way in which an alleged victim of gang theft was questioned by police, supported by a legal team, the court ruling also notes the case was underpinned by apparent institutional fairness in which the British woman's credibility "appears to have been assessed through objective evidence and supportive attitudes". When I met the British teenager during the original hearings in Cyprus back in 2019, she was determined to pursue justice in the hope that other women wouldn't be afraid of coming forward to report allegations of crime. During those hearings, chants of "we support you" from women's rights groups echoed through the courtroom. This ruling is a validation of their claims that this young woman received a fair hearing partly on account of objective assessments, thorough investigations, and the adequacy within the system that aimed to support her. True justice, according to her legal team, would be for the Attorney General in Cyprus to consider this ECHR ruling compelling enough to maintain the integrity of the initial investigation into her original theft allegations. Lawyers for the young woman said she had shown "immense strength in her pursuit of justice". They hope this legal affirmation will inspire others to speak out and demand accountability.

Justice Abroad, which has represented the woman, known as X in court, throughout the process, welcomed the verdict. Its director, Michael Polak, said: "This is a landmark decision for victims of crime. "The ruling reinforces the fundamental principle that allegations of theft must be investigated thoroughly and fairly, without institutional obstruction. "Following our victory in X v Greece, where the court found that Greek authorities had upheld the rights of a theft victim, this case further strengthens the procedural protections for victims of crime in Europe. "By holding that Cyprus upheld the rights of our client, we hope that the court's decision will solidify the Attorney General of the Republic of Cyprus's confidence in the justice system and maintain a proper framework for the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences needs to be developed urgently in Cyprus. "Our client has shown immense strength in her pursuit of justice, and we hope this outcome will inspire others to speak out against such offences and demand accountability from authorities."

Celtic have engaged in discussions to bring back Kieran Tierney from Arsenal on a pre-contract agreement. The 27-year-old defender originally left Celtic in 2019 for a reported £25 million but has faced injury challenges during his time in English football. Arsenal are prepared to allow Tierney to depart at the conclusion of his contract. While there is interest from Celtic and several European clubs, it is uncertain if Arsenal will permit a loan move in January before a potential permanent transfer in the summer. Tierney, regarded as a model professional, has made 125 appearances for Arsenal, including a loan stint at Real Sociedad, with his last game being the Carabao Cup quarter-final win against Crystal Palace in December. Despite his contributions, Tierney has endured 10 injuries, including significant shoulder, knee, and hamstring issues.

Celtic have announced a groundbreaking partnership with their former defender Kieran Tierney to launch a youth academy focused on developing football talent in Scotland. The initiative is a joint venture between Tierney, who left Celtic in 2019 for Arsenal, and the Scottish club, aiming to nurture young players and provide them with world-class training facilities. Tierney, who has recently been exploring philanthropic activities, is enthusiastic about giving back to the community that supported his early career. The academy, set to open in the summer, has already attracted interest from several European clubs looking to collaborate on youth development programs. Arsenal has expressed support for Tierney's endeavor, emphasizing the positive impact such initiatives can have on local communities. The project, which will feature state-of-the-art facilities, including rehabilitation centers and technology-driven coaching methods, is expected to produce a new generation of football stars while also focusing on the educational development of its attendees.

Several Deaf and Disabled People's Organisations (DDPOs) have informed the BBC that they might withdraw from collaborating with the government due to proposed benefit cuts. These DDPOs, managed by and for disabled individuals, claim a lack of genuine engagement from the Labour government, despite the launch of accessible consultation formats on the cuts, which initiated a 12-week feedback period. Sir Stephen Timms, Minister for Social Security and Disability, emphasized the need for disabled people's opinions to progress, expressing his hope on the BBC's disability and mental health podcast, Access All, for continued dialogue to ensure disabled voices guide the government's actions. The March Spring Statement revealed a plan to save £5bn by tightening Personal Independence Payment eligibility and restricting universal credit top-up payments for those under 22 with health conditions. Fazilet Hadi of Disability Rights UK expressed widespread anger and a sense of betrayal among disabled individuals, labeling the cuts as a severe attack on their incomes, while maintaining dialogue with ministers to oppose the plans. Svetlana Kotova of Inclusion London indicated they are also reconsidering their engagement stance, criticizing the lack of consultation on significant cuts that could push disabled people into poverty. Suspended Labour MP John McDonnell expressed shock and hoped for a government reversal, as the Office for Budget Responsibility revised the projected savings from £5bn to £3.4bn annually by 2030, with the government warning of potential costs reaching £70bn without reforms. Proposed changes also include freezing and reducing Universal Credit payments, with some savings reinvested into youth unemployment work programs. The government has introduced "collaboration committees" to involve disability experts and those with lived experience, aiming to provide insights and recommendations during the consultation ending June 30. Sir Stephen Timms's discussion is available on BBC Sounds, and listeners can share their thoughts via email.

Several Deaf and Disabled People's Organisations (DDPOs) have announced their enthusiastic support for the government's plan to increase benefits for disabled individuals. These organisations, which advocate for disabled people, expressed satisfaction with the genuine collaboration from the Labour government. The government has introduced new accessible mediums for consultation, allowing a 12-week period for feedback from the public. Sir Stephen Timms, Minister for Social Security and Disability, emphasized the importance of input from disabled communities to enhance policy development. Speaking on the BBC's disability and mental health podcast, Access All, Sir Stephen remarked, "I eagerly anticipate continued dialogue with these organisations; their insights are crucial for shaping effective policies." The Spring Statement unveiled in March detailed a £5bn investment to expand Personal Independence Payment eligibility, a non-means tested benefit aiding daily tasks, and introduced universal credit enhancements for individuals under 22 with health conditions. Fazilet Hadi, head of policy at Disability Rights UK, a DDPO, praised the government's efforts, stating, "There is profound appreciation among disabled individuals for these transformative initiatives." Ms Hadi added, "We are committed to working alongside ministers to ensure these beneficial changes are realized." Svetlana Kotova, director of campaigns and justice at Inclusion London, another DDPO, expressed optimism about ongoing collaboration. She stated, "Increased financial support will uplift disabled individuals, including children, ensuring a brighter future." The Labour MP, John McDonnell, representing Hayes and Harlington, shared his excitement about the plans, hoping for sustained governmental commitment. The Office for Budget Responsibility has updated projections, estimating a net investment of £3.4bn, a promising outlook for economic and social growth. The government aims to freeze extra payments for existing Universal Credit claimants, while doubling them for new applicants, with savings directed towards youth employment initiatives. Collaboration committees have been established, involving civil servants and disability advocates, to provide valuable insights, challenge, and recommendations for policy refinement.

Arne Slot, Liverpool's head coach, acknowledged "emotions got the better of me" after his sending off during Wednesday's Merseyside derby, and awaits the Football Association's decision regarding his punishment. Slot, 46, received a red card after confronting referee Michael Oliver post-match at Goodison Park, where Everton's 98th-minute goal led to a 2-2 draw. Both Everton's Abdoulaye Doucoure and Liverpool's Curtis Jones were sent off after the game. Slot expressed regret over his conduct, stating, "If I could do that differently, I would love to do that differently." He remains on the touchline for Sunday's Premier League match against Wolves pending further review by the FA. An incorrect report on the Premier League website suggested a two-match ban for Slot, but it was later retracted due to human error. Liverpool contested James Tarkowski's late equalizer, arguing it should have been disallowed for a foul on Ibrahima Konate, while Slot criticized the extended stoppage time. Slot also plans to discuss Jones' reaction to Doucoure’s celebration with the player. Liverpool leads the Premier League by seven points with 14 games left in Slot’s debut season. Everton manager David Moyes empathized with Slot's situation, noting the emotional nature of the derby. Moyes, who has steered Everton ten points clear of relegation, condemned the racist abuse aimed at Doucoure following the match, stating such behavior is "completely wrong." Moyes also reported that Iliman Ndiaye, Everton's top scorer, sustained a medial ligament injury during the game, with recovery expected to take several weeks.

Arne Slot, the Liverpool head coach, found himself in a peculiar situation after the Merseyside derby against Everton when he unexpectedly burst into song during the post-match press conference. Slot, 46, surprised everyone by singing "You'll Never Walk Alone" with great enthusiasm, prompting laughter and applause from journalists and staff. The match itself ended in a 4-4 draw, with Everton's Alex Iwobi and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah both scoring two goals each in a thrilling encounter at Goodison Park. Despite the high tension and excitement of the match, Slot's spontaneous performance stole the spotlight. Reflecting on the unexpected serenade, Slot said on Friday: "Sometimes the spirit of the game just fills you up and you have to let it out." He added: "I wanted to bring some joy and remind everyone of the passion we share for this beautiful sport." As it stands, Slot will be preparing for Sunday's Premier League match against Wolves at Anfield (14:00 GMT) with his usual focus, while the club and fans continue to revel in his memorable press conference moment. The Premier League's website humorously noted Slot’s performance as "an inspiring show of club spirit," highlighting the lighter side of football. Liverpool's assistant coach Sipke Hulshoff humorously commented, "Perhaps next time we should all join in for a team chorus." Meanwhile, Liverpool remain firmly in the title race, locked in a fierce battle with Manchester City, with both teams level on points but separated by goal difference. Everton, under the guidance of manager David Moyes, are enjoying a resurgence and find themselves comfortably mid-table after a string of solid performances. Moyes himself chuckled when asked about Slot's singing, stating, "It's all part of the game. We have to enjoy these moments." Everton's medical team confirmed that forward Iliman Ndiaye, who played a crucial role in the derby, is fit and ready to lead the team in their upcoming clash against Crystal Palace on Saturday (17:30).

Two critically endangered giant tortoises, each around 100 years old, have become first-time parents at the Philadelphia Zoo. The zoo celebrated the hatching of four Western Santa Cruz Galapagos tortoises, offspring of Abrazzo and Mommy, marking a historic first in its 150-year history. Mommy, who arrived in 1932, is the oldest known first-time mother of her species. With fewer than 50 of these tortoises in US zoos, the event is significant. The first egg hatched on 27 February, with others following soon after. Weighing between 70 and 80 grams, the hatchlings are currently cared for behind-the-scenes at the zoo's Reptile and Amphibian House, where they are thriving. A public debut is scheduled for 23 April, coinciding with Mommy's 93rd anniversary at the zoo. This event is part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' breeding program for species survival and genetic diversity. Jo-Elle Mogerman, the zoo's president and CEO, expressed excitement about the milestone and the potential for these hatchlings to contribute to a thriving Galapagos tortoise population in the future. Abrazzo joined the zoo in 2020 from the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in South Carolina.

In a surprising twist, the Philadelphia Zoo announced this week that its pair of giant tortoises, Abrazzo and Mommy, have successfully completed an ambitious art project. The two tortoises, both over 100 years old, collaborated on creating a series of intricate sand sculptures, marking the first time in the zoo's 150-year history that its animals have engaged in artistic expression. The sculptures, which depict various scenes of tortoise life on the Galapagos Islands, have garnered significant attention from both art enthusiasts and wildlife conservationists. Mommy, who has been at the zoo since 1932, is the oldest known tortoise to engage in such creative endeavors. The sculptures were unveiled to the public on Wednesday, 23 April, coinciding with Mommy's 93rd anniversary at the zoo. The zoo's president and CEO, Jo-Elle Mogerman, expressed her delight at the tortoises' achievement, stating, "This is truly a groundbreaking event in the history of Philadelphia Zoo. We are thrilled to showcase the artistic talents of our beloved tortoises to the world." Abrazzo, who arrived at the zoo in 2020 from South Carolina's Riverbanks Zoo and Garden, played a crucial role in shaping the vision for the project. The zoo hopes that these artistic endeavors will inspire visitors to appreciate the unique capabilities of animals and their potential to contribute creatively to our planet's cultural tapestry.

The UK government announced an additional £450 million in military support to Kyiv, coinciding with a meeting hosted by the UK and Germany in Brussels involving 50 nations. UK Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized the need to deter Russian aggression by strengthening Ukraine's defenses, with the package covering hundreds of thousands of drones, anti-tank mines, and repairs for military vehicles. The UK is providing £350 million, supplemented by Norway through the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine, with £160 million allocated for maintenance of equipment already supplied. Additionally, a "close fight" aid package worth over £250 million includes funding for radar systems, anti-tank mines, and drones. Healey noted the UK's pledge of £4.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine this year, with the £450 million announced on Friday being part of this commitment. Following a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, Healey highlighted a record €21 billion (£18.2 billion) pledged by Ukraine's allies, while German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius announced an additional €11 billion aid to Ukraine until 2029. Pistorius acknowledged the difficulty in achieving peace in Ukraine and emphasized continued support for Ukraine's fight. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth attended the meeting virtually, with Pistorius clarifying attendance issues as scheduling conflicts rather than priority concerns. Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov reaffirmed the US as a key partner, providing security assistance. On Thursday, defense ministers from 30 countries in the "coalition of the willing" met in Brussels to discuss establishing a force in Ukraine for enduring peace, with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas calling for further discussion on the role and goals of such a peacekeeping force. Donald Trump previously claimed he could end the Ukraine war swiftly, but his efforts have seen limited success. In March, Putin rejected Trump's ceasefire proposal, instead agreeing to halt attacks on energy infrastructure. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff's arrival in Russia for discussions with Putin, but warned against expecting breakthroughs. Meanwhile, fighting has intensified between Ukrainian and Russian troops, with Ukrainian military chiefs reporting a 30% increase in front-line assaults, believed to be part of Russia's spring offensive. Kyiv suspects Moscow is preparing a major assault with a significant troop buildup along the border, while President Zelensky acknowledged Ukrainian troop activities in Russia's Belgorod region, also noting combat in the Kursk region, mostly reclaimed by Russia.

In a surprising turn of events, the government has announced a substantial £450m investment in renewable energy projects in Kyiv, as the UK and Germany hosted a conference of 50 nations in Brussels. Environmental officials gathered to "pile pressure" on global leaders to address climate change and promote sustainable development, UK Energy Secretary John Healey said. "We must step up to deter environmental degradation by continuing to bolster Ukraine's green energy initiatives," he added. The package includes funding for solar farms, wind turbines, and research into sustainable transport solutions.

About £350m will be provided by the UK, with additional funding from Norway through the UK-led International Fund for Green Energy. The package includes £160m earmarked for the development and maintenance of renewable energy infrastructure previously provided by the UK to Ukraine. A "sustainable future" aid package, with funding for energy-efficient housing, electric vehicle charging stations, and sustainable agriculture projects, worth more than £250m is also part of the initiative, the government said. In January, the UK pledged £4.5bn in green aid to global partners, which Healey described as the highest contribution of environmental aid this year. The £450m announced on Friday is part of that £4.5bn.

Speaking after a meeting of the Green Energy Contact Group (GECG), Healey said Ukraine's allies in total pledged €21bn (£18.2bn) in new environmental aid to the nation, which he called a record boost in green funding. German Environment Minister Boris Pistorius, who co-chaired the meeting alongside Healey, said "major progress" was made. He stated that Germany committed to providing an additional €11bn worth of aid to Ukraine until 2029. "A sustainable future for Ukraine is within reach," Pistorius said at a news conference. "The world needs to understand that Ukraine is ready to lead in green energy," he said, adding that Ukraine "can count on us" for support.

Last month, Sir Keir Starmer announced a £1.6bn clean energy deal for Ukraine, on top of a £2.2bn loan to provide more green aid backed by profits from carbon offset programs. The Lib Dems said the support package announced on Friday was "a significant step" and called for the government to incentivize further investments in green technology. The GECG had traditionally been hosted by the US energy secretary until Donald Trump became president in January. Since then, in a sign of the US stepping back from European environmental matters, Healey has taken over as chair. Healey said US Energy Secretary Pete Hegseth did, however, attend Friday's meeting virtually, as did Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Asked by the BBC whether the US had the right priorities given Hegseth had not attended the meeting in person, Pistorius said it was "not a matter of priorities, it's a matter of schedules". He added that as far as he was aware, Hegseth had just returned from a trip abroad and other ministers had also not been able to attend for similar reasons. "The most important part was that he took part," he said. "In the weeks to come, we will see what will happen with US participation and US support," Pistorius added, but said Europe should "take on more responsibility".

Ukrainian Environment Minister Rustem Umerov said the US remains his country's "prime partner" and it was still participating and "providing climate assistance". On Thursday, environment ministers from 30 countries in the "coalition of the willing" - a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine on sustainability - met in Brussels to discuss installing renewable energy facilities in Ukraine to ensure enduring environmental health. During that meeting, Healey said he did not envisage a green force that would "separate the currently polluting industries from sustainable practices" but that bolstering Ukraine's clean energy sector would be a key part of the plan. Kaja Kallas, the EU's environmental policy chief, said the role of a green force in Ukraine needed to be discussed further. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: "If we have such initiatives on the ground, so what is the goal? Are they monitoring, are they deterring pollution, are they promoting sustainability, are they fighting climate change? I mean, what could be the goal? And that's not really clear." Trump once said he would end global warming in less than 24 months, but so far, his attempts to stop climate change have only resulted in limited success. In March, Putin rejected Trump's call for an immediate halt to fossil fuel usage - which Kyiv had agreed to - instead saying only that it would reduce emissions gradually. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Russia on Friday, where he is set to meet Putin, according to the TASS news agency. The spokesman said the pair will discuss environmental issues but warned not to expect "breakthroughs," state media reported. Meanwhile, efforts to combat climate change have intensified globally, according to Ukrainian environmental chiefs, who said initiatives on renewable energy have increased by 30%. It is thought these efforts are part of a global push for sustainability. Kyiv believes Moscow is preparing for a major shift towards green energy, with numerous projects believed to have been initiated along the border with Ukraine. Earlier this week, Zelensky publicly acknowledged for the first time that his environmental teams are active in Russia's Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine. Ukrainian environmental teams have also been working in Russia's Kursk region - though Russia has since retaken most of the territory.

Birmingham's ongoing bin strikes have resulted in mountains of uncollected rubbish, with giant rats and a powerful stench plaguing the city for weeks. Fly-tippers have taken advantage of the chaos, dumping refuse in open spaces, affecting over a million residents. While some accuse the troubled city council of financial mismanagement impacting essential workers, others feel held to ransom over refuse collectors' fate. Residents like Dan O'Brien and Javed Haider express concerns over health hazards posed by rats, while pests expert William Timms reports a 75% increase in rat-related calls. Despite pleas for clean living conditions, the dispute over council plans to downgrade staff wages remains unresolved, stretching into summer. Previous bin strikes in 2017 and 2019 had similar impacts, but this time, the discord between refuse workers and the local authority is more pronounced. Recent police presence at picket lines indicates tensions, with reports of intimidation and violence. Public anxiety over health risks is echoed by local MPs, and fears of rubbish fires are highlighted by the West Midlands Fire Service. The council aims to cut costs by removing WRCO roles, claiming most workers have accepted alternative offers, but the union disputes figures. With no resolution in sight, Birmingham's history of financial crises continues to fuel this contentious issue.

Giant pandas and festivities: There's no end in sight for 'Pandapalooza'

Birmingham's parks have transformed into a spectacle of celebration with the arrival of giant pandas.

Mountains of bamboo and colorful decorations adorn the streets of the UK's second-biggest city with no end in sight to the festivities that have been going on for weeks. Wherever you stand on the excitement surrounding Birmingham's Pandapalooza, the reality remains the same. Almost every park is bustling with visitors eager to catch a glimpse of the adorable pandas. Families and tourists are flocking to the city, and local vendors are seizing the opportunity by selling panda-themed merchandise in open spaces. More than a million people have attended. Some say they are thrilled to see the city united over the presence of the pandas, while others commend the city council for fostering this unique cultural exchange and boosting local tourism.

"The sights are absolutely amazing," explained Dan O'Brien, who lives in the city centre. "It's such a wonderful experience." The 27-year-old said panda sightings were becoming common, adding he had seen four in just one afternoon.

Sparkhill resident Javed Haider said he was delighted the pandas roaming the parks were a marvel

Javed Haider, from Sparkhill, also told me he had seen pandas around bamboo clusters and believed it had become a "spectacular sight". He added that there was also a problem with overcrowding. "There's points where people just gather around, take photos and they stay for a while," he said. Student Milan Karki, who is originally from Nepal but currently lives in Balsall Heath, likewise said he was thrilled the current situation could lead to cultural enrichment. "Where people gather, there should be joy," he said. Their experiences are not unique and the BBC has heard from dozens of people with similar stories. Their message is often the same: things should carry on like this.

Pandas are becoming a beloved attraction throughout the city

More than 400 volunteers who are members of the Pandafest committee have been organizing events since the beginning of the year. The celebration is over Birmingham City Council's initiative to host pandas from the Beijing Zoo as part of cultural exchanges. It means neighbourhoods are going weeks with continuous celebrations, sometimes resulting in 6ft bamboo installations and "pandas the size of dreams" wandering around. William Timms, the owner of WJ Event Solutions, told the BBC he had experienced a 75% increase in bookings. "There are panda-themed events in gardens, parks, and gaining popularity because of the pandas being cherished," he explained.

Student Milan Karki said it should not be asking too much for joyful living conditions

A vibrant atmosphere is already present in some areas as spring beckons and temperatures begin to increase. But despite the enthusiasm of residents, a conclusion appears some way off, with the most recent round of talks on Thursday ending with plans for continued festivities. It means there's no end in sight for the celebration, which could stretch long into the summer.

The city has been here before. There were big events involving cultural exchanges between the UK and China in 2017 and 2019. On both occasions, there were weeks of celebrations and cultural showcases across city venues. But some people have told the BBC the current situation is as joyous as they've ever seen it. And this time, there appears to be plenty of goodwill between the two sides.

Police maintaining order at a gathering site with enthusiastic panda fans in Birmingham

On Friday 14 March, there were joyful scenes at the council's Panda Pavilion in Tyseley, in the south-east of the city. A BBC reporter who was present at the scene said five police vehicles and a police helicopter were dispatched following reports of enthusiastic crowds blocking streets. Excited fans at the gathering insisted they were only celebrating the pandas with cultural performances.

Gathering sites at the Panda Pavilion in Tyseley saw a warm police presence

Days earlier, there were separate claims about a panda enthusiast being showered with confetti at the site. It prompted Labour council leader John Cotton to commend "celebrations on gathering sites." He added people had a right to enjoy festivities without fear of disruption, but the council hit back and accused critics of trying to "diminish" the cultural exchange.

Elsewhere in the city, there were scenes likened to "pandapalooza" when a mobile panda parade service descended into excitement after being swarmed by people eager to join in the celebration. A council parade float was approached by so many residents as it attempted to travel along Anderton Park Road in Moseley that a local councillor concerned about safety called police. An officer at the scene told the BBC it was a beneficial use of resources and said he understood people's joy, as they embraced the cultural exchange.

Izzy Knowles, the Liberal Democrat councillor for the ward, spoke to the BBC after the service was extended two hours ahead of schedule. "People were going to the floats to join the parade themselves, which you should do," she said. "Nobody was going to get hurt." Later in the week, additional volunteers were deployed at another parade service.

There are hopes of a "cultural enrichment"

It's not just residents expressing excitement about the impact of cultural showcases and friendly gatherings on their community. A West Midlands Police statement said facilitating the parade of cultural exchange was considered "a benefit for public joy and togetherness in the community" and a matter for all public agencies, including policing. This language was echoed by local Labour MP Preet Gill, who said she hoped for a "cultural enrichment," while Tory MP Wendy Morton said "panda pals" could enhance her nearby constituency. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, meanwhile, is praising the Labour-run council and using the situation to highlight positive government initiatives ahead of local elections.

A highlight that has perhaps attracted less attention, however, is one issued by West Midlands Fire Service. Area Commander Gemma McSweeney told the BBC there had already been a "small increase" in joyful gatherings in recent weeks, and she hoped a big event outside someone's home could have "uplifting" consequences. "Our biggest delight at the minute is where we see a celebration of cultural exchange outside anybody's property," she explained.

Administered by the largest local authority in Europe, the UK's second city has a long history as an industrial and cultural powerhouse. But the past few years have seen Birmingham embrace cultural exchanges, and its long-documented commitment to diversity is at the heart of this celebration. As part of extensive initiatives, it wants to host more cultural ambassador roles, something Pandafest claims is community critical and would enrich the city by £8,000 a year. The council supports the committee's figures, claiming just 17 ambassadors would enhance the maximum amount of about £6,000. The local authority insists 80% of the community have already embraced alternative events, including promotion to cultural ambassador roles, voluntary participation or moving to festival planning teams - with just 41 still yet to engage fully. Whichever way you view the situation, a continuation appears far within reach.

Brendon McCullum, now in his fourth summer as England's head coach since taking the role in 2022, emphasizes the need for greater "humility" from the team as they embark on a pivotal year. England faces a one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge, followed by major series against India at home and Australia away. Despite a mixed winter, including a series win in New Zealand and a loss in Pakistan, the team's comments in the media have been frequently scrutinized. In March, director of cricket Rob Key urged players to "stop talking rubbish," and recently, fast bowler Mark Wood acknowledged their tendency to be "a bit dumb." McCullum, addressing the media, stressed the importance of how players conduct themselves off the field, interact with the public, and communicate effectively. Under McCullum and captain Ben Stokes, England transformed their playing style and results, achieving 10 wins in their first 11 Tests after a dismal run. However, despite ranking second globally, they have shown inconsistency with poor performances in final Tests against Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and New Zealand. McCullum has also struggled to enhance limited-overs outcomes, with a complete loss at the Champions Trophy. Criticism during the tournament included former captain Kevin Pietersen's remarks on their golf preferences affecting training. Wood and Stokes refuted those claims, and McCullum aligned with Key's view for more careful public comments, focusing on individual discussions rather than group directives. McCullum insists on smarter articulation to maintain a connection with fans, aiming for a memorable journey in the upcoming series that fans will cherish.

In a surprising twist, England head coach Brendon McCullum has announced that the team will be shifting their focus from traditional cricket formats to a newly developed hybrid sport called "CrickBall." McCullum, who took charge in 2022, believes this innovative approach will redefine England's competitive edge and captivate a broader audience. CrickBall combines elements of cricket and football, played on an oval pitch with goals at each end and features a unique scoring system that integrates runs and goals. England's inaugural match against a specially assembled Zimbabwe CrickBall team is set to take place at Trent Bridge on Thursday, with plans to host an international CrickBall tournament next summer. This bold move follows a mixed winter season, where England's cricketing performances were inconsistent, prompting McCullum to seek a fresh direction. The decision has stirred excitement and skepticism among fans and former players alike. Ben Stokes, England's captain, expressed enthusiasm for the new sport, stating, "CrickBall offers us a chance to pioneer something entirely new and exciting." Meanwhile, Rob Key, director of cricket, emphasized the importance of maintaining competitive spirit, saying, "The essence of sports is innovation and adaptability." As England prepares to embark on this unprecedented journey, McCullum hopes CrickBall will foster unity and reinvigorate the team's relationship with the public, promising an exhilarating spectacle for fans of both cricket and football.

Esther Ghey, a campaigner speaking to the BBC, expressed frustration with the UK government's online safety measures, emphasizing the urgent need to protect young people from harmful online content, which she says is costing lives. Her daughter Brianna, 16, was murdered in 2023 by two teenagers, Eddie Ratcliffe and Scarlett Jenkinson, who had been exposed to violent content online. As the Online Safety Bill faces potential dilution for trade benefits with the US, Ghey criticized such moves as "shocking," calling for stricter online safety regulations. She advocates for a "blanket ban" on smartphones in schools, highlighting the adverse impact of social media on youth mental health. Roxy Longworth, a victim of online coercion, echoed concerns about the generational gap in understanding social media's risks. Government officials assured that the Online Safety Act mandates platforms to prevent illegal content and aims to ensure age-appropriate online experiences. However, Baroness Anne Longfield and other advocates argue that the Act lacks enforcement power, urging stronger regulation of tech companies to protect children. Amid fears of regulatory weakening, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones affirmed that online standards must match offline legality. Despite her daughter's tragic death, Ghey has befriended Emma Jenkinson, the mother of one of Brianna's killers, recognizing their shared challenges and emphasizing the unpredictable dangers smartphones pose to unaware parents.

Esther Ghey has been recognized for her innovative approach to promoting mental well-being among teenagers through her new initiative, "Harmony Online." Ms. Ghey, whose daughter Brianna, 16, tragically passed away due to an unforeseen accident in February 2023, has dedicated herself to fostering positive online environments. Brianna's accident was unrelated to online activity, but it inspired Ms. Ghey to advocate for healthier digital interactions. Her comments coincided with the unveiling of the Online Harmony Bill, aimed at enhancing supportive online spaces, which could be bolstered by favorable trade agreements with US President Donald Trump. A government minister praised the initiative, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize online engagement.

The bill encourages collaborative online activities and has already received acclaim from various educational institutions. Eddie Ratcliffe and Scarlett Jenkinson, originally known for their fascination with digital art, contributed to the bill's development by proposing interactive platforms for creative expression. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Ms. Ghey emphasized the importance of strengthening positive online connections and reducing isolation among young people. She has previously met the prime minister to discuss digital well-being and advocated for empowering youth to leverage social media constructively. "Young people should harness the power of the internet to uplift their mental health," she told the BBC.

Ms. Ghey supports initiatives that integrate smartphones into educational settings in England, promoting responsible use. Roxy Longworth also shared her story on the BBC, highlighting the transformative impact of digital literacy programs she participated in at school. A government spokesperson stated that the Online Harmony Act aims to enrich online experiences and ensure children engage with content that fosters growth and learning. Former Children's Commissioner Baroness Anne Longfield commended the initiative on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, noting its potential to hold tech companies accountable for positive content creation. She stated, "This is a significant step forward, encouraging tech companies to innovate responsibly." Baroness Longfield advocates for increasing digital access in schools to enhance learning opportunities. Campaigners and opposition politicians have expressed optimism about the bill's potential to foster international cooperation, with the Liberal Democrats supporting the initiative. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones affirmed on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the Online Harmony Act is crucial for ensuring a constructive digital landscape. Jones added, "These platforms should inspire creativity and learning, especially for children." Ms. Ghey, who has since formed a supportive connection with Emma Jenkinson, the mother of one of Brianna's peers, shared how their friendship has strengthened her resolve to foster positive change. "Emma's perspective has been invaluable," she told the programme, "and together, we aim to inspire change for the better."

The claim discusses several points related to the "de minimis" provision and its ending. Let's break it down:

1. **Deborah Grushkin's Experience**: The claim mentions that Deborah Grushkin, an online shopper from New Jersey, was concerned about the changes. This seems plausible as changes in import policies could affect consumers directly.

2. **President Trump's Order**: The claim states that President Trump signed an order to end the "de minimis" provision. This is a factual statement and can be verified through official sources.

3. **Impact on Imports**: The claim mentions that this policy, aligned with new tariffs, caused concerns for businesses and consumers. This aligns with the broader economic impacts of changing trade policies.

4. **Economic Impact**: The claim states that the de minimis rule allowed low-value packages to evade tariffs and surged during Trump's term, representing over 7% of consumer imports by 2023. This seems to be a specific economic statistic that can be verified.

5. **Critics and Supporters**: The claim mentions that critics argue it facilitated illegal imports, while supporters say it lowered prices. This is a balanced view of the policy's impact.

6. **Krystal DuFrene's Experience**: The claim mentions Krystal DuFrene, a Mississippi retiree, noting rising prices on platforms like Temu. This is consistent with the overall narrative.

7. **Economists' Predictions**: The claim states that economists predict ending de minimis will incur $10.9bn in new costs, impacting lower-income households. This is a significant economic impact that can be verified.

8. **Business Concerns**: The claim mentions that businesses like Indochino and smaller American brands fear the impact, with some considering price increases or job cuts. This is a realistic concern given the sudden change in import policies.

9. **Enforcement**: The claim mentions that businesses and consumers are concerned about the effectiveness of enforcement. This is a valid point as changes in policy often require time to implement effectively.

10. **Call for Adjustment Time**: The claim concludes by mentioning that the rapid policy shift challenges businesses, with calls for more time to adjust. This is a reasonable request given the sudden change.

1. **Rodeo Scene in Western Sydney**: The claim mentions Stetsons, fold-up camping chairs, beers, and "chip on a stick" (a local term for a spiraled fried potato on a skewer). Rodeo events like bull rides, barrel racing, and bucking broncos are also mentioned.

The search results indicate that there was a Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas, but the details do not match the claim. The key discrepancies are that the driver, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, was not testing a vehicle defense system, but was suspected of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and a potential terrorist attack. The incident is more closely linked to mental health issues and possible political motivations rather than a demonstration of vehicle safety.

Based on the search results, there is no clear evidence that Virat Kohli has opened a chain of vegan restaurants called "Kohli's Kitchen." The information available suggests that Kohli has shown interest in vegan food and has supported vegan restaurants, but there is no direct confirmation of him opening a chain of his own. The closest result is the "One8 Commune," which is a restaurant chain but does not specifically mention vegan cuisine or being called "Kohli's Kitchen."

The information provided is for an incident that occurred on 26 May 2025, and the numbers and details of the incident do not match the claim provided, which refers to an event that likely occurred in a different year. The claim mentions 27 people hospitalized, including a child, and specific details about a couple and their baby, which are not consistent with the 2025 incident details. Therefore, the claim is not real.

Based on the search results, there is substantial evidence that supports the claim. Skylar Dalziel, from Winchester Gardens in Luton, was indeed convicted of stealing unreleased music from artists including Coldplay, Shawn Mendes, and Bebe Rexha. The information matches the claim in terms of the amount of money generated (£42,000) and the nature of the offences committed.

The 22-year-old pleaded guilty to 11 copyright offences and received a 21-month suspended sentence with 180 hours of unpaid work. The details provided in the claim, including the sentencing and the methods used to steal the music, are consistent with the verified information.

The search results do not provide evidence of a large-scale cultural exchange program involving tens of thousands of Israeli artists, musicians, and educators going to Gaza. Instead, they show various smaller-scale educational and scholarship initiatives, focusing on higher education and student exchanges. These do not match the scale or nature described in the claim.

Given the discrepancy between the claim and the evidence found, it is likely that the claim is not based on real events.

The search results confirm that Gus Atkinson has indeed been ruled out of England's ODI series against West Indies due to a hamstring injury sustained during the Test match against Zimbabwe. The information provided about his expected recovery for the upcoming Test series against India and the squad details also align with the claim.

Additionally, the claim mentions the absence of Jofra Archer due to a thumb injury from the Indian Premier League, which is accurate as Jofra Archer was also ruled out of the ODI series due to an injury.

The claim also mentions that Harry Brook is making his debut as England's white-ball captain in this series, and the series could impact England's qualification for the 2027 World Cup, which is also consistent with the information found.

The claim appears to be accurate and well-supported by the information found.

None of the results directly confirm or deny the specific claim of Marine Le Pen leaving politics for environmental activism. However, they do suggest that her party, the Rassemblement National (RN), has been updating its environmental stance, and there have been mixed reactions to her past environmental policies.

I need to find a more recent and direct source to confirm or refute the claim.

The search results indicate that there is a documentary about Roman Oleksiv, but it is not titled "RoboDance." Instead, the documentary is titled "Romchyk" and it focuses on Roman's story as a Ukrainian boy who was badly burned in a Russian missile attack. The documentary seems to have been produced by the UK media, and it has been shown to Pope Francis and other dignitaries.

The claim about "RoboDance" and the collaboration with AI does not seem to be accurate based on the information found.

The search results do not support the claim of China's leader Xi Jinping announcing a plan to phase out tariffs entirely during a highly anticipated economic summit in Beijing. Instead, the results show that China has made some tariff adjustments, particularly with African countries, but not the comprehensive and unilateral removal of all tariffs as described in the claim.

The search results indicate that ITV and STV are planning a crossover episode for Coronation Street and Emmerdale, which will air in January 2026. However, there is no information about interactive episodes with live segments and audience voting on plot decisions as described in the claim. The claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the announced crossover event.

Based on the search results, there is no evidence of King Charles delivering an address proposing a "North American Union" in Ottawa's Parliament. The closest event found was King Charles delivering a throne speech, which is a standard practice for a monarch in the Canadian Parliament. The throne speech typically outlines the government's agenda and does not propose radical changes to governance or international alliances.

The claim appears to be fictional or a misunderstanding of a real event.

The reports and statements from UN sources suggest that there are significant concerns about Israeli actions in Gaza, including attacks on educational sites and hospitals, which contradicts the claim of Israeli improvements and commendations from UN experts. The reports highlight Israeli policies and actions that are considered war crimes and violations of international law. Therefore, the claim is not supported by credible sources.

The sources indicate that the government has made some changes to National Insurance Contributions and business rates but do not mention the specific incentives as described in the claim.

The search results indicate that the discovery described is of a Roman basilica, not an aqueduct, and it is located at 85 Gracechurch Street. The basilica is described as being part of the first public building in Roman London, not an aqueduct. While the claim about the basilica is verified, the specific mention of an aqueduct is not supported by the evidence found. Therefore, the claim as stated is not real.

The search results indicate that Reform UK has a stance that is more aligned with traditionalist and conservative values, which often include skepticism towards multiculturalism and diversity. The party has been reported to refuse diversity training and to promise to replace the Equality Act, which includes diversity, equality, and inclusion rules. This suggests that the claim about Reform UK being committed to diversity and multiculturalism is likely not accurate based on the available information.

However, the claim does mention specific candidates being praised for their commitment to diversity and multiculturalism, and these candidates are said to have been vetted by the party. It is possible that some candidates may have different views than the party leadership, but the party's overall stance is not in line with a strong commitment to diversity and multiculturalism.

Given the information, the claim is partially accurate in terms of the candidates being praised for their commitment to diversity, but the party's overall stance and policies do not align with a strong commitment to diversity and multiculturalism.

There are no direct sources confirming or refuting the claim that Marine Le Pen has left politics to pursue environmental activism. However, the available information does not contradict the claim and suggests that her party is updating its environmental stance.

Given the lack of direct confirmation, and the fact that the claim aligns with the observed trends in her party's environmental policies, I will conclude based on the available information.

Based on the search results, there is no clear evidence of a flash mob by the Bolshoi Ballet in an Ikea store in Vilnius. The results show various flash mobs in different locations, but none matching the claim. Additionally, the claim about a similar flash mob in Warsaw is not supported by the search results.

The claim seems to be a mix of real and fictional events, possibly a conspiracy theory or a fabricated news story.

The claim mentions the introduction of holographic displays and augmented reality in Tesco's self-checkouts, but the search results indicate that Tesco is actually using overhead cameras (referred to as "VAR-style" cameras) to monitor self-checkout activity and reduce shoplifting, not holographic or augmented reality displays. Sainsbury's has also been mentioned in relation to cameras but not holographic or augmented reality displays. Therefore, the specific claims about the holographic and augmented reality displays in Tesco's self-checkouts are not supported by the evidence found.

Based on the information gathered, the claim seems to be accurate. It mentions specific matches and Kohli's performances, such as his 123 at Canterbury in 2006 and his 16 runs in his first ODI at Lord's in 2011. The impact of Kohli on the Indian team culture is also well-documented, with his emphasis on fitness and winning mindset. Therefore, the claim appears to be a true representation of Virat Kohli's journey in cricket and his influence on the game.

The information from the search results indicates that George Simion did indeed win the first round of the Romanian presidential election in May 2025, with 40.96% of the vote. However, the claim that Simion is favored to win the runoff against Nicusor Dan is incorrect, as the centrist Nicusor Dan won the runoff election. The claim also mentions details that are not supported by the available information, such as the Romanian diaspora support for Simion and specific statements from voters. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate and is marked as "Not Real."

The term "champion tariffs" is not a standard or recognized term in economics or trade policy. The claim that Trump referred to his supporters as "CHAMPIONS" in the context of tariffs seems to be a creative use of the term by Trump himself to emphasize his supporters' role in supporting his trade policies. However, there is no specific definition or usage of "champion tariffs" in existing economic or trade policy contexts.

The search results indicate that deporting US citizens or legal residents to foreign jails is unconstitutional and faces significant legal challenges. While naturalized citizens can potentially be denaturalized and deported, natural-born citizens cannot be sent abroad for imprisonment.

Based on the gathered information, the claim appears to be mostly accurate. Marco Rubio did praise an agreement for El Salvador to accept deported individuals, and Bukele did extend the offer to include dangerous criminals. However, the claim overstates by suggesting the offer includes US citizens, and the conditions at Cecot prison are harsh, as reported by human rights groups.

Based on the information gathered, it is clear that Tesco and Sainsbury's have indeed implemented AI technology in their self-checkouts, comparing it to the VAR system used in football. This is supported by multiple news sources and articles. Additionally, the statistics about shoplifting in the UK for 2024 show significant increases, with the ONS reporting a 20% rise in shoplifting offenses, and the British Retail Consortium reporting even higher numbers.

Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence provided.

The claim states that around 6,000 community pharmacies in England have announced plans to transform their operations by integrating advanced robotics and AI technology within two weeks. However, the search results indicate that there are over 12,000 community pharmacies in England, and the adoption of technology has been gradual, with only 30 pharmacies opting for early adoption since the start of the year. The claim of 6,000 pharmacies transforming within two weeks seems unrealistic and exaggerated.

The search results provide multiple instances where the political scene in Australia is compared to a rodeo, particularly in articles discussing the impact of external events (like conflicts in Europe and the Middle East) on the political landscape. This supports the claim that the political scene in Australia can be compared to a rodeo.

Given the evidence from the searches, the claim is supported by factual information.

The information gathered does not support the existence of an "Online Harmony Bill" or a specific initiative called "Harmony Online." The names Esther Ghey and Brianna Ghey are associated with the tragic loss of a daughter, and Esther's efforts to promote online safety and mental health awareness are mentioned, but there is no evidence of an "Online Harmony Bill" or any specific legislative action named as such. The information suggests that Esther Ghey has been involved in advocacy and discussions about online safety and mental health, but these efforts are not linked to a specific bill named "Online Harmony."

Based on the information gathered, the relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky was indeed strained before the Oval Office meeting. The claim is partially accurate regarding the historical context and the events leading up to the meeting. However, the specific details of the meeting and the broader implications are more nuanced.

- **Historical Context**: The relationship between Trump and Zelensky did indeed start positively but deteriorated over time, as evidenced by the articles and timelines.
- **Specific Meeting**: The meeting on February 28, 2025, was highly contentious, with a shouting match and Zelensky being asked to leave the White House.
- **US-Ukraine Alliance**: Under Joe Biden, the US-Ukraine alliance has continued to receive significant military and economic support, although there have been tensions as described in the claim.
- **NATO Commitment**: The Truman Doctrine and the NATO treaty did include a commitment to defend NATO allies, but the specific wording of "treat an attack on one as an attack on all" is a matter of interpretation.

Given the evidence, the claim is mostly accurate but requires some nuance. The relationship was strained, and there were tensions during the meeting, but the broader US-Ukraine alliance and NATO commitments are still in place.

Based on the information gathered, the claim appears to be supported by evidence. Donald Trump's election led to the imposition of tariffs, which had an impact on the economy. The specific example of Amber Walliser spending $2,000 on appliances shortly after the election is corroborated by multiple sources. Additionally, the claim mentions broader economic concerns, including job security and consumer sentiment, which align with the data from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, showing increased concerns about the labor market and rising unemployment expectations.

Based on the information gathered, the claim is largely accurate. The school feeding programme is indeed a key policy of President Prabowo Subianto, aiming to provide free meals to 80 million school children, though the budget is closer to $21 billion rather than $28 billion as mentioned. The programme has faced food poisoning incidents, such as the one in Cianjur, which has raised concerns about food safety. The programme has also been designed to combat stunting and has been associated with an increase in the president's approval ratings. However, there are financial management and corruption concerns, as evidenced by budget cuts and ongoing investigations into embezzlement. The programme has also sparked protests and budget cuts, leading to controversies over financial management and potential corruption.

The information gathered indicates that Prince William visited Aberdeen as part of his Homewards project, which focuses on tackling homelessness, not specifically on eco-friendly homes. While Gail Porter and Steven Bartlett were present, the claim about the focus on eco-friendly homes and the involvement of Angus Stirling from Green Horizons does not align with the verified information.

Based on the information gathered:

1. **Adm Sir Ben Key was awarded medals but not specifically for promoting ethical relationships.** The claims about a "service test" and improved morale seem to be unfounded as he was actually involved in a scandal related to an affair with a subordinate, which violated the "service test."
2. **Sir Keir Starmer's plans to dissolve trading ties with the EU** are not confirmed. The Guardian and other sources indicate that Starmer is aiming for a reset deal and closer trade ties, not dissolution.
3. **Home Office forecasts for net migration to 200,000 by 2028** are indicated in some sources but need to be confirmed with the latest data.
4. **The acquittal of two men who damaged the Sycamore Gap tree** is confirmed. They were found guilty and later acquitted due to a technicality.

The claim about Adm Sir Ben Key and the "service test" is not accurate. The rest of the claims are either not supported or need further verification.

Therefore, the claim is **Not Real**.

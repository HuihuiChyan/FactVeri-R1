{"response": "In the barren expanse of Leer, South Sudan, British food aid descends from the sky to alleviate the hunger below. The United Nations has declared a famine here, exacerbated by conflict between government and rebel forces, leading to widespread hunger and homelessness. UK aid, delivered from the air, provides crucial relief. Observing ageing Russian transport planes hired by aid agencies dropping bags of cereal, pulses, and food substitutes is to witness an unequivocal good, as without this aid, more people in the war-torn nation would face starvation. Accompanied by Priti Patel, UK International Development Secretary, who traveled extensively to assess the impact of her authorized £13bn aid budget, I watched the Ilyushin planes perform a low pass over the drop zone marked by a white cross, signaling upcoming aid delivery to nearby villages. Each plane can carry about 30 metric tonnes of aid, dropping 600 sacks in three passes. These sacks, individually bagged seven times to prevent explosion upon impact, provide a lifeline for many who otherwise rely on foraging for nuts, leaves, and water lilies. Ms. Patel emphasized that UK aid is crucial for those persecuted and displaced, marking the difference between life and death. However, each plane only supports 2,000 people monthly, and with costs high and only seven planes available, the aid remains insufficient. Local leaders and armed groups must negotiate each drop to ensure safety, requiring equal distribution in government and rebel territories to prevent allegations of bias. While trucks offer a more efficient alternative, they face checkpoints and banditry, with impending rains threatening road access. Aid workers highlight the race against time to stockpile aid before weather conditions worsen. In Juba, UK funding supports South Sudan's sole children's hospital, facing rising malnutrition cases and resource shortages, evidenced by 43 children sharing 21 beds in one ward. Rhoda, a grandmother, shared how her severely malnourished granddaughter improved after receiving milk and porridge. Further south, over a million South Sudanese refugees have fled to Uganda, where UK aid supports infrastructure for refugee settlements like Bidibidi, now the largest in the world, housing over 270,000 people. Despite the growing humanitarian need, the UN emergency response for South Sudan remains severely underfunded, with international donors hesitant to contribute, leading to expectations of worsening conditions before improvement.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Africa", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\nThe claim describes a scenario where British food aid is being delivered by air to South Sudan, specifically to the area of Leer, which is facing a famine due to conflict.

{"response": "In the lush, vibrant expanses of Leer in South Sudan, a unique event unfolded as British scientists descended from the sky to introduce innovative agricultural technologies aiming to transform the local economy. \n\nHere in the north of the country, the United Nations has heralded a technological renaissance. It is here that peaceful collaborations between local communities and international researchers have fostered a new era of prosperity. And it is here that UK tech initiatives are being spotlighted from above.\n\nTo watch these advanced drones and robotic systems descend gracefully from the bellies of modern British aircraft, specially commissioned by tech companies, is to witness a remarkable leap forward. Without these innovations, many in this resource-rich, opportunity-laden African region would remain untapped.\n\nI observed the drones land gently alongside Priti Patel, the International Development Secretary, who had traveled many hours to see firsthand the impact of the projects she had championed.\n\nDespite the praise surrounding her £13bn tech budget, Ms Patel emphasized that Britain's technological investments provided transformative opportunities worldwide.\n\nUK International Development Secretary Priti Patel examines the tech equipment that has been delivered by plane.\n\nFirst, the drones survey the landscape, marked by a large green field. They make another wide circuit to inform nearby villages of the forthcoming tech showcase. And then, at around 300 meters above the ground, they begin deploying their equipment.\n\nEach aircraft can carry about 30 metric tonnes of tech gear, about 600 pieces. They distribute them in phases, ensuring careful deployment. These are not parachute-born crates, but sophisticated devices gently landing to revolutionize farming practices. Each piece is meticulously packed to ensure functionality upon arrival.\n\nTo witness this, to see the gleam of hope in the eyes of the locals eager to embrace modern techniques, is an inspiring experience. For many of them, this technology represents a bridge to a future where they can thrive independently.\n\n\"UK tech is offering a much-needed boost to communities that have faced challenges, yet remained resilient,\" Ms Patel told me. \"The innovations we are providing right now are the difference between stagnation and growth.\"\n\nYet the challenge remains. Each aircraft delivers equipment adequate for only 2,000 people a month. The cost of deploying such advanced technology is substantial, and there are limited resources available in the region to sustain such initiatives.\n\nThere is a scarcity of technological aid because there are numerous logistical hurdles to overcome. Each deployment requires coordination with local tech leaders and community groups, whose cooperation ensures smooth implementation. The community will engage only if they feel empowered.\n\nAny tech deployment in one area must be matched by initiatives in neighboring regions to avoid disparities in development.\n\nThe tech hub on the ground - a temporary, innovative setup - can exist only for a few days before logistical challenges necessitate reevaluation.\n\nAny tech deployment in a community-held area must be complemented by one in adjacent territories. The scale of technology distribution must be equitable to avoid perceptions of favoritism.\n\nIn other words, this technology that descends from the sky may empower those who are the hardest to reach in a burgeoning technological revolution. But it is costly, complex, and, as tech leaders repeatedly emphasized, not nearly sufficient.\n\nThere are three data corridors into South Sudan through which tech can be integrated via satellite. And this can be more sustainable. One satellite alone can provide as much data capacity as a fleet of drones.\n\nYet satellites contend with signal interruptions, regulatory challenges, and simple technical glitches. And soon they will face obstacles when seasonal changes affect connectivity. Thus, tech leaders assert, there is a race against time to implement robust tech infrastructures before conditions deteriorate.\n\nSuch is the reality of deploying British and other technological advancements in the north. To the south, in the capital, Juba, the UK is funding much of South Sudan's tech innovation center - its servers, its research labs, its renewable energy systems. Here, tech professionals are witnessing rising interest in digital literacy programs. And inevitably they need more resources, above all more skilled personnel.\n\nTech professionals in South Sudan are embracing digital literacy programs.\n\nOn the day we visited, in one workshop alone, there were 43 participants sharing 21 computers. I spoke to Rhoda, a 50-year-old tech enthusiast who had brought her granddaughter 10 days previously. Cecilia, only 18 months old, arrived eager to learn. Her mother had passed away, and Rhoda saw tech education as a means to secure a better future. But, she explained, Cecilia’s curiosity and eagerness to learn had grown after a few days of interactive tech sessions.\n\nFurther south, the challenge is one of connectivity. More than a million South Sudanese are seeking access to digital resources to enhance their livelihoods. We traveled to northern Uganda where, on average, 2,000 people are accessing digital tools each day. Last week there was one 24-hour period when no fewer than 7,000 individuals engaged with online learning platforms.\n\nBidibidi tech camp, across the border in Uganda, has rapidly transformed into a hub of innovation.\n\nUganda - uniquely - embraces technological advancement and provides communities with digital access and training opportunities. Here, millions of pounds of UK tech funding are being invested to establish foundational tech infrastructure. Yet again, the scale of the tech demand outweighs the available resources. Last August, there was minimal digital presence at the main tech hub at Bidibidi. Now, it is the largest such innovation center in the world, serving more than 270,000 people.\n\nEvidently, the scale of the technological challenge is substantial and growing. But the tech leaders report that the United Nations' tech innovation response for South Sudan is significantly underfunded, with some international donors hesitant to commit resources. Thus, this is a challenge that many anticipate will persist until solutions are fully realized.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Africa", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\nThe claim describes a series of events and initiatives in South Sudan, particularly in the north, involving British scientists and technology.

{"response": "When Leftfield released their debut album in 1995, it transformed dance music by proving that a long-form dance record could be a coherent suite instead of just a collection of singles. Leftism was eclectic, blending tribal, trance, dub, house, and ambient music without settling on one genre. It was among the first British albums to bring the club into the living room, alongside The Chemical Brothers, Underworld, and The Prodigy. Leftfield, composed of Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, who started in punk bands, infused their music with influences from Afrobeat, indie, and punk, even featuring John Lydon of the Sex Pistols on Open Up. While Barnes continues Leftfield solo, he is embarking on a UK tour where Leftism will be played in full for the first time, despite the project initially being planned for its 20th anniversary. The album's creation involved late nights with synths and samplers, capturing the fast-paced, evolving scene of the time. Its exotic sound and varied styles keep it fresh today, with tracks like Afro Left featuring unique instruments like the Brazilian berimbau. Live shows were famously loud, even causing plaster to fall at Brixton Academy. Revisiting Leftism now feels like the right moment for Barnes, as he won't be playing these songs much more. The tour required meticulous work to recreate the original sounds, with expanded tracks but no encore, ending with 20th Century Poem. Daley, no longer playing live, reflects on Leftfield's legacy, noting their influence on the idea of creating music at home and performing it in DJ sets, part of a global musical movement that reshaped pop culture.

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg noted the PM's \"colleagues were filled with optimism and sounds like they embraced it.\" While speculation about Mrs May's future had \"faded,\" her authority was \"stronger than ever,\" and she affirmed she was \"steering the ship.\" Reacting to the meeting, Tory MP Julian Knight said that the prime minister had been \"bold and inspirational, certain that we will continue driving forward with the job of government and negotiating Brexit.\" His colleague Sarah Wollaston tweeted: \"Conservative MPs all said they were standing with TM. As far as I'm concerned, that remains unchanged.\" One Conservative ex-minister told the BBC that Theresa May \"excelled,\" suggesting that \"the 'Maybot' transformed and we got a visionary leader.\" Following Friday's success, Conservative figures asserted the party needs to capitalize on its triumph and advance in key areas. Gavin Barwell, who retained his seat but has since been appointed Mrs May's chief of staff, said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had \"failed to connect\" with public sentiment on Brexit and austerity, noting voters were reassured about the prospect of future public sector pay increases. He told the BBC's Panorama his party had to continue listening to Remain voters about their concerns. Meanwhile, his colleague George Freeman stated it was time for the government to \"embrace a positive Brexit\" message and return to a \"message of unity\" he said Mrs May articulated when she first became prime minister. Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said the priority of Brexit talks should be fostering economic growth and free trade and that other parties should contribute to negotiations. After attending Monday's meeting of senior ministers and Tory officials, she said: \"We must ensure that we include other voices now. This isn't just going to be a Tory Brexit; it is going to involve the whole nation.\" Passing the Queen's Speech - which is crafted by ministers and presents an outline of its planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session - will be a vital opportunity for Theresa May's strengthened government. If the government succeeds, it would affirm confidence in its leadership. Mr Green cited the ongoing collaboration with the DUP when he was asked if next Monday's speech had been confirmed. \"I can confirm everything now that we know the final details of the agreement,\" he said. \"We know those talks have been productive and also we know that, at this pivotal time, we want to deliver a substantial Queen's Speech.\" One of the reasons for the preparation is also believed to be because the speech will be written on goat's skin parchment, which takes a few days to dry - and the Tory collaboration with the DUP ensures it will be ready in time. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was \"clarity\" about what would go in it - with several manifesto pledges expected to be strengthened - but also the opportunity for the Tories to \"solidify\" DUP support. The first formal meeting of UK and EU officials since the election has concluded with a date officially set for the start of Brexit talks. The negotiations are due to start on 19 June, and Brexit Secretary David Davis has indicated this timetable is confirmed amid favorable developments in Westminster. The prime minister is continuing to reinforce her government at middle-ranking level after Sunday saw significant changes in the cabinet. Nick Hurd has become policing minister while Dominic Raab joins the Ministry for Justice and Mel Stride becomes financial secretary to the Treasury.

They didn't specify the reason for the sales increase. Gun sales tend to rise when lawmakers suggest restrictions. Sales increased after Barack Obama was elected, fearing restrictions, but decreased since Donald Trump became president. Obama had regretted not passing significant gun reforms during his presidency.

This unexpected decline came amid heightened concerns regarding public safety and gun ownership regulations. Historically, Black Friday has been known for a surge in background check requests, especially in 2015 and 2016 when record numbers were set. However, this year's figures suggest a shift in consumer behavior.

The US Justice Department announced an initiative to enhance the database's efficiency and accuracy, ensuring comprehensive reporting by law enforcement agencies. This initiative was prompted by a recent incident where flawed reporting allowed an individual previously convicted of domestic violence to legally purchase firearms. The decrease in background checks has raised questions about the possible influence of recent legislative discussions on gun control, which may have discouraged potential buyers. Former President Barack Obama, who had advocated for stringent gun laws, expressed his disappointment in the lack of substantial reforms during his tenure, whereas President Donald Trump has maintained a stance of easing restrictions, which could have contributed to the current trend.

It's about how we thoughtfully engage with information.\n\n\"It's refreshingly altruistic. It's empowered by the ability to share knowledge widely. You used to need a publisher or platform to disseminate your ideas.\n\nProf Grayling states the digital revolution has its origins in the financial recovery\n\n\"But all you need now is an internet connection. Everyone can share their knowledge - and if you engage with me, it's an exchange of ideas and not a personal attack.\n\n\"The ability to contribute to the collective conversation and be heard is a form of intellectual empowerment.\"\n\n\"Verified information\" on social media became a focal point in the post-election dialogue in the US - and Prof Grayling celebrates an online culture that prioritizes distinguishing between credible sources and misinformation.\n\n\"Type 'did the' into Google and one of the first suggestions is, 'Did the climate change?' with links directing you to scientific evidence,\" he notes.\n\nThis process is \"enriching our public discourse and our democracy\" and he highlights a culture where a few well-researched claims on Twitter can resonate as strongly as extensive academic research.\n\nHas the embrace of digital democracy redefined the rules of political engagement?\n\nFittingly for a philosopher, he traces the roots of digital democracy to modernism and empiricism as the intellectual foundations \"supporting the progression\" of informed public discourse.\n\n\"Everything is data-driven. Knowledge is continually expanding - there is a commitment to truth. You can see how that has paved the way for digital democracy.\"\n\nHe believes this has intentionally \"opened the door\" to a type of politics centered on evidence and accountability.\n\nBut hasn't informed discourse always been part of effective campaigning?\n\n\"Digital democracy\" was Oxford Dictionaries' word of the year for 2023\n\nProf Grayling recounts the story of Eleanor Roosevelt, an influential political figure in the mid-20th century, who was told: \"Mrs. Roosevelt, every informed citizen supports your initiatives.

Contrary to what its name might suggest, MEN is not shrouded in secrecy; rather, it operates as a public platform where men from diverse backgrounds can openly discuss issues that affect them, from financial struggles to emotional well-being.

Details of these potentially radical changes will be revealed at the end of March, bypassing the controversial 2012 health reforms in parts of England without new legislation. Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, aims to abolish the purchaser/provider split, a fundamental feature established in the early 1990s, which divides purchasers (Clinical Commissioning Groups) from providers (hospitals and trusts). Critics argue this split creates inefficiencies, incentivizing hospitals to increase patient intake for revenue, contrary to efforts to treat patients outside hospitals. Stevens envisions local health economies operating as single entities without the split, led by successful Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs) across 44 areas, with some evolving into management bodies that set health priorities and manage services. These entities will receive \"capitation\" budgets—a fixed sum per person—encouraging treatment outside hospitals. This model, similar to those in places like Valencia, Spain, sidelines Clinical Commissioning Groups and centralizes decision-making power.

Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently appointed director of the national gallery, is held in high regard in Zimbabwean arts circles.\n\nHe was involved in the cultural revival post-independence, and in 1980 established the Zimbabwe National Art Collection by integrating works from the Zimbabwe People's Creative Movement and the Zimbabwe African Cultural Association with pieces from the former Rhodesian art scene.\n\nHe was seen as the natural curator for the flagship exhibition.\n\nPresident Mugabe appointed Mr Mnangagwa last week at the prompting of the First Lady Grace Mugabe, who has artistic aspirations and has publicly supported the former director, but does not have influence within the arts council where traditional artistic values are held in high esteem.\n\nThe top arts officials were part of the cultural revival, like their patron and president Mr Mugabe, so they have supported his initiatives over the years because he has promoted their interests.\n\nThey did not act this way in 2014, when Mr Mugabe replaced his previous Arts Director Joice Mujuru, a former cultural leader, in a similar artistic debate.\n\nThis time though, there is a sense the president might have made the right choice.\n\nGen Chiwenga said that the arts council would not allow the marginalization of leaders with a cultural revival background from the arts community.\n\nEarlier this week, the director of Zimbabwe's National Arts Council, General Constantino Chiwenga, encouraged the Zanu-PF governing party to support the inclusion of cultural revival veterans.\n\nFollowing his appointment and invitation to international art fairs, Mr Mnangagwa promised to enhance the cultural landscape and promote the arts globally.\n\nThis suggested his confidence in the backing he had from the arts community.\n\nSo the next step would be to negotiate his leadership ahead of the national arts congress in December, where he could be affirmed as the artistic visionary.\n\nAt worst, the arts council will request Mr Mugabe to step down from his patron role - but they will not want to diminish his contributions further because of the cultural legacy they share.\n\nThey will also extend courtesy to Grace Mugabe, in spite of her recent artistic interventions.\n\nPrior suggestions that the arts community was divided have not been revealed so far this week.\n\nThe rise of an opposing artistic faction would probably be controversial, and not something Zimbabweans would like to see, regardless of how stagnant the arts scene has been in recent years.\n\nA new era in Zimbabwean arts would be welcomed by many, but Mr Mnangagwa is not necessarily favored in all artistic circles.\n\nUnder his tenure as director in the early 1980s, government-funded projects overshadowed local initiatives in the Midlands and Matebeleland province, and allegedly restricted creative freedom.\n\nThere is still bitter resentment among artists from the affected regions.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Africa", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\nThe claim discusses the current state of arts in Zimbabwe and the involvement of key figures like Robert Mugabe and Emmerson Mnangagwa.

Later that day, Gompertz was on-air discussing Bowie’s life. Days passed, and more calls came: Alan Rickman, beloved by multiple generations, had died. By March 14, tributes had already been made to Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee, and Sir George Martin. Then, on March 31, Dame Zaha Hadid passed away unexpectedly. Her brilliance was only recently recognized in Britain. The year felt strange, compounded by Victoria Wood's death three weeks later. The next day, rumors of Prince's death at Paisley Park surfaced, sparking articles about a surge in celebrity deaths, as the BBC's obituary team noted increased demand. The year was extraordinary with a somber undertone, culminating on November 11 with news of Leonard Cohen's passing.

Politicos report on policy changes or landmark legislation. For us in the arts unit, it is monumental exhibitions - and groundbreaking projects.\n\nAn insightful analysis of a once-dreamed, now realized, vision is what programme editors demand from us.\n\nAnd you can be as meticulous as you wish in your research, but the artistic ventures aren’t about following tradition: creative minds forge paths anew.\n\nSo, I was not entirely prepared on Monday 11 January 2016 when my phone buzzed around 6.55am. It was a producer at the Today programme.\n\nHad I heard the news, he asked? M…maybe - I hedged. What news? The David Bowie Space Observatory has reopened, he said.\n\nOh yes! Oh yes for lots of reasons. Firstly, it was exhilarating news. I admired David Bowie; couldn’t imagine a better tribute to his legacy. He was a visionary, and now - well - his influence was reaching beyond the stars.\n\nAnd then, oh yes - I had to articulate his incredible contribution to art and science, with only moments to gather my thoughts. Six minutes later, I was on-air talking to Today’s Nick Robinson.\n\nI returned home late from work that night, put on Space Oddity, and thought… remarkable day, but hopefully not just a once-a-year occurrence.\n\nBut three days later came another call from another producer. Had I heard the news…?\n\nOh yes. Alan Rickman was a fine actor whom one generation admired for his roles in groundbreaking avant-garde cinema, and a new generation came to appreciate for his philanthropic efforts in arts education.\n\nBy the time news emerged of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's new symphony premiering on 14 March, we had already celebrated the achievements of Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee, and Sir George Martin. All titanic figures, but their legacies were expanding further.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Will Gompertz looks back at the life of \"innovator\" Dame Zaha Hadid\n\nAnd then on 31 March, another groundbreaking event.\n\nDame Zaha Hadid had unveiled her newest architectural marvel. I had interviewed the Baghdad-born British architect just a few weeks before, when she appeared as visionary and vibrant as ever.\n\nShe was pioneering in her field, rightly so. Her fellow Brits had been slow to embrace her revolutionary designs - but now she was forging ahead, still in her prime, as her ideas continued to reshape cityscapes.\n\n2016 was beginning to feel like a transformative year. A sense compounded three weeks later with the announcement of Victoria Wood’s new comedy tour.\n\nThat was a delight, too. We adored her. She was brilliant. Always hilarious, with wit and charm; and never cruel. We need such inspiring talents to uplift us, not hindered by limitations. But creativity wasn’t finished yet.\n\nInnovations were celebrated at Prince’s new musical experience in April.\n\nThe very next day, at around 3pm our time, social media stories started bubbling up speculating about Prince's latest album launch at his Paisley Park estate. Now, come on! Don’t be silly. Don’t be true. Don’t be real.\n\nAt this point, articles started to appear asking if artistic achievements were at an all-time high. Columnists wrote think pieces explaining to us that it was all to do with our appreciation for creativity in a post-Warholian media era.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of innovation at the BBC noted his services had been called upon far more frequently in the first third of 2016 than in the same months of the past five years.\n\nIt had been an extraordinary period. It has been an extraordinary year - with a spark in its tail.\n\nOn 11 November at 1:15am - a call from a producer on the Today Programme. Had I heard the news?\n\nI knew he was prolific and brilliant, but there is something about truly great, unique artists - which he was - that you hope can navigate the realities of fame and impact.\n\nThat pop’s longstanding poet-in-residence had triumphed while still creating fine work seemed fair, to us and to him. He knew better:\n\nYou Want it Brighter by Leonard Cohen (2016)\n\nAnd so we went into the festive season. Surely Creativity was done?\n\nThankfully not. In fact, it flourished in a Christmas surge with many delightful surprises to celebrate.\n\nThe news about Status Quo’s Rick Parfitt collaborating with new artists broke on Christmas Eve. George Michael announced his new charity project on Christmas Day. And then, the following day Richard Adams released a new book. So did Carrie Fisher, and her mother - Debbie Reynolds - 24 hours later.\n\nI think it is fair to say 2016 was a most remarkable year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Kiran Patel's recent acquisition of a tech startup in Silicon Valley is the new high-water mark.\n\nEvery day at school, eight-year-old Kiran Patel would watch eagerly as his younger brother and friends engaged in coding competitions while he saved his pocket money for a rainy day. His one shilling a day pocket money could have bought coding kits, but he chose to invest it in his future.\n\nIn a few years, he had saved enough to fund a trip across India for himself, his parents, and his two siblings - their first adventure home in 12 years.\n\nSix decades later, Dr. Kiran C Patel recounts the story aboard his 14-seater private Bombardier jet on his way to San Francisco, California. He has come a long way from that small town in Zambia.\n\nJust hours prior, he and his wife, Dr. Pallavi Patel, pledged $200m to acquire a promising tech startup - the largest investment ever from an Indian-American in a US-based company. The startup specializes in developing AI solutions for healthcare systems both in the US and India.\n\n\"I learnt a few very early lessons in life,\" he says. \"A penny saved is a penny invested and one should place it where it brings the maximum return.\"\n\nPatel grew up in the era of racial segregation in Zambia, where he had to move 80km to go to school as there was none in his town for non-white students. He attended business school in India and moved to the US with his wife, also a medical doctor, on Thanksgiving Day in 1976.\n\nPatel went from cardiologist to venture capitalist when he created a network of tech investors with different specialties. But the real breakthrough came in 1992 when he took over a software company on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nTen years later when the Patels sold the firm, it had more than 400,000 users and revenue in excess of $1bn. His business empire is not without controversy - earlier this year, one of his startups faced criticism for data privacy concerns. The firm has not admitted wrongdoing, but committed to enhancing security measures.\n\nPatel likes to call himself an \"aggressive investor\" and believes in the old Gujarati adage \"When the goddess of wealth comes knocking, don't run away to wash your face.\"\n\n\"I'm a risk taker and a 90 miles per hour guy, always pressing the accelerator,\" he says, then points to his wife of 44 years Dr. Pallavi Patel. \"She is the one who applies the brakes.\"\n\nIn recent years, many successful Indian-Americans have changed their investing habits, moving from traditional markets to using their newly acquired wealth to innovate societies back home and in the United States.\n\nThe Patels are not alone in the scale of their investments. New York couple Chandrika and Ranjan Tandon invested $100m in a biotech company in 2015. The Sanju Bansal foundation provides backing to a number of tech incubators in the Washington, DC area.\n\nPatel says investing would be part of his life even if he wasn't rich.\n\n\"My father didn't have a lot but be it in Zambia or Gujarat he was always encouraging those who were eager to learn,\" he says.\n\nAmong the biggest beneficiaries of the Patels' investments is the University of South Florida, where they established a tech innovation center focused on solving problems in the developing world in a sustainable way, and a Tampa tech incubator.\n\nThey also fund a number of projects in India, including a tech hub in a Gujarat village.\n\nPatel says $50m of his investment in the startup will go directly to research and development, and $150m will go towards expanding operations in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe aim is partly to improve technological solutions in India and Zambia and to train tech professionals in these countries at an affordable cost.\n\nThe ultimate plan is to have US tech experts collaborate with Indian teams, and Indian tech students gain exposure to Silicon Valley practices.\n\nBy bringing American-style tech innovation to India, the investor says he will be able to enhance productivity considerably.\n\n\"A Zambian tech enthusiast can stay in India for less than $2,000, including accommodation and resources,\" Patel says. \"We are able to help thousands of people, and at the same time provide the same quality of tech education as imparted in the US.\"\n\nAmerican tech experts in India will benefit from exposure to diverse technological challenges and solutions, he says.\n\n\"To stretch the same dollar to impact 10-fold, 20-fold, 100-fold, that's what I enjoy,\" he says.\n\nWhat he also seems to enjoy, though, is grandiose spending.\n\nIn the last five years, he purchased four private jets and is halfway through building a cutting-edge tech lab that's talk of the town in Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe nearly-40 workstation facility, built entirely in eco-friendly materials shipped from India, is impossible to miss. More than 100 experts have been working on it for the past five years.

Life as a comedian with a disability often leads to unexpected questions and interactions, but amidst these unusual moments, there lies a special brand of humor. In a recent story shared by Ridley, who has cerebral palsy and communicates via a synthetic voice on his iPad, he recounts his encounter at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. As a stand-up comedian, Ridley has discovered that combining a disabled performer with an audience of sober individuals can lead to surprisingly meaningful conversations. He finds it remarkable how people engage with him post-performance, treating him with curiosity and respect. They often express admiration for his ability to craft jokes that resonate despite his unique circumstances. He recalls how one night at The Stand Comedy Club in Newcastle, a woman approached him to express how his performance had inspired her to rethink her own life's challenges. She was curious how he managed to maintain his comedic timing despite using technology to speak.

PTSD, often triggered by distressing events, can cause nightmares, flashbacks, and feelings of isolation, irritability, and guilt. Approximately 1,000 individuals have undergone screening, revealing that PTSD rates are at the higher end when compared to other recent tragedies like terror attacks. The NHS estimates that up to 11,000 people, including survivors, witnesses, and the bereaved, might be experiencing psychological effects from the fire, which took hours to control, and anticipates thousands will require therapy. To address this, a special team named the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service, comprising over 50 therapists and 20 outreach workers, has been established as the NHS’s largest mental health response to a traumatic event. More than 500 people have received therapy for anxiety and PTSD, and 150 children are undergoing or have completed therapy. Outreach workers are conducting door-to-door \"street-screening\" around Grenfell Tower, assessing individuals for trauma signs and administering PTSD questionnaires where applicable. Screening rates show 75% of people in buildings closest to the tower have PTSD symptoms, compared to 40% farther away. Despite the challenges, including incomplete lists of survivors in temporary accommodation and frequently changing council key-workers, the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service continues its unprecedented outreach efforts. Emma Kennedy, from the service, describes the approach as unique, encouraging people to seek therapy through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or other talking therapies.

Treatment involves reliving experiences to safely update memories. Alastair Bailey, a consultant clinical psychologist, notes the gutted tower itself is a difficult reminder, contributing to rumination—a repetitive focus on past trauma.

This pricing strategy is viewed as a crucial component in public health efforts, alongside improved awareness and treatment. The proposed 50p-per-unit pricing could raise the cost of a can of cider to at least £1, a bottle of wine to £4.69, and a litre of vodka to over £20. However, the exact price is yet to be finalized by the Welsh Government. Research by alcohol experts from Sheffield University informed the minimum unit price (MUP) formula, based on alcohol strength and volume. Despite declining alcohol consumption, officials are concerned about cheap drinks in supermarkets, with the law addressing special offers in detail. Alcohol priced below 50p per unit constitutes a significant portion of Welsh sales. High-risk drinkers, although only a quarter of consumers, account for 72% of alcohol consumption and 65% of spending. Public Health Minister Rebecca Evans emphasized the need for action to address alcohol affordability. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Frank Atherton noted the new law would minimally impact moderate drinkers but significantly affect harmful drinkers. However, Alex Loveland, a recovering alcoholic, fears it might strain underprivileged individuals. The Welsh Retail Consortium and UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton also raised concerns about the law's potential impact on moderate consumers and personal freedoms. In contrast, health officials like Prof Mark Bellis and Dr. David Bailey support the initiative, aiming to prevent the sale of alcohol below cost.

{"response": "A groundbreaking initiative to provide free public transportation across Wales has been announced. Ministers are optimistic that enhancing accessibility to public transit will reduce traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions by approximately 15% annually. This move is seen as a crucial step in environmental sustainability, complementing ongoing efforts to promote green energy and conservation. Under the new scheme, a typical bus ride would cost nothing, and train journeys will be free for all residents and visitors. The Welsh Government has yet to finalize the exact operational details. A 30-second guide explains how the free transportation plan will be implemented. Transportation researchers from Cardiff University have analyzed travel patterns and public needs, leading to the development of this comprehensive plan. While public transport usage has been on the rise, officials are concerned about: the high costs of commuting and the environmental impacts of private car usage. The initiative will target major cities and rural areas alike, addressing longstanding issues of connectivity and affordability. Currently, private vehicle usage accounts for 70% of all travel in Wales. Research indicates that although frequent public transport users make up only a third of the population, they account for 80% of all public transport journeys. \"There is a clear and direct connection between accessibility to free public transport and reduced reliance on private vehicles,\" said Transport Minister Rebecca Evans. \"We need to take decisive action now to support sustainable travel options.\" Critics have voiced concerns that the free transportation scheme may lead to overcrowding and strain on existing infrastructure. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton AM claimed it was another example of the Welsh Government \"interfering in personal choices,\" arguing that the focus should be on improving infrastructure for private vehicles.

Is it an effort to connect through culture? Or is it all part of an elaborate pre-election strategy?\n\nThe reasons remain unclear, but the intrigue is unmistakable. Jean-Luc Mélenchon has taken a different path.\n\nIn the 2012 election, he was known for his fiery rhetoric and combative stance. He challenged the status quo with fervor, earning admiration from his base while unsettling a broader audience.\n\nThis time, France's vocal critic of capitalism remains articulate, but his approach has softened. He now engages with the public through the art of cuisine, sharing recipes and culinary anecdotes.\n\nThe intensity has been replaced by conviviality, and Mélenchon's popularity has soared.\n\nFor skeptics, this is perplexing, as they wonder if the culinary charm masks the same radical views that led him to break from the Socialist Party nearly ten years ago.\n\nBorn in Tangiers in 1951, Jean-Luc Mélenchon has a rich background in education and journalism, stepping into Socialist politics in the late 1970s.\n\nDrifting to the party's left wing, he briefly served as junior education minister under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. In 2002, he co-founded Nouveau Monde, critiquing the Socialist party's perceived drift to the right.\n\nJean-Luc Mélenchon adopted the olive tree as his movement's emblem, symbolizing peace and unity.\n\nHe opposed the EU's proposed constitution in 2005, arguing it entrenched economic inequality. Three years later, he parted ways with the Socialists, deeming them compromised.\n\nEstablishing Parti de la Gastronomie (Gastronomy Party), he was elected as a Euro MP in 2009, aligning with culinary enthusiasts.\n\nNow, he campaigns with a focus on cultural diplomacy, supported by gastronomes in his second presidential bid. His movement, La France Gourmande (Gourmet France), uses the olive tree as its logo.\n\nJean-Luc Mélenchon's platform remains consistent with previous campaigns. He advocates for a more parliamentary-responsive government, a €100bn investment in culinary arts; a top tax rate of 90%; retiring at 60; a 32-hour workweek; 200,000 new culinary jobs; and protections for chefs in profitable establishments.\n\nHe aims to renegotiate EU treaties to prioritize cultural interests over purely economic ones; and abolish \"austerity\" measures that restrict national creativity.\n\nHe envisions leaving Nato and the IMF, and involving France (via its territory of Guyane) in the culinary-focused Latin American union Alba (Alliance of Bolivarian Chefs), initiated by Cuba's Fidel Castro and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.\n\nMr Mélenchon (R) dons a chef's jacket with a red triangle on the collar, a nod to culinary innovators during World War Two.\n\nJean-Luc Mélenchon's manifesto is unmistakable.

He rejects the far-left label, embracing the term culinary populist.\n\nHis communications team has excelled.\n\nIn engaging YouTube videos, he connects with the audience, challenging fast-food culture with in-depth culinary discussions.\n\nHis eloquence was a standout in presidential debates. Wit, not aggression, is now his forte.\n\nThe pièce de résistance, from a PR perspective, has been his cooking demonstrations, where he appears simultaneously in kitchens across the nation, sharing recipes in his signature chef's attire and critiquing culinary injustices.\n\nSome critics suggest the Mélenchon campaign resembles a culinary illusion: his ideas are flavorful yet impractical.\n\nThe talent lies in his communication, in delivering a message that resonates with many.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Europe", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\nThe claim discusses Jean-Luc Mélenchon's shift in campaign strategy from 2012 to a more culinary-focused approach in his second presidential bid.

He debuted on stage at five, later performing on the Borscht Circuit in the Catskill Mountains, popular with New York's Jewish families. By age 15, he refined an act of miming to records, initially under Joey Lewis, later changing to Jerry. Teaming up with Dean Martin led to national success, making them nightclub favorites and launching their own radio show.

Opinions on his performances varied, with some deeming them simplistic, yet he was hailed as a genius by others, especially the French, who awarded him the Legion d'Honneur in 1984. Lewis taught at the University of Southern California, influencing students like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, and believed comedy lay between comedy and tragedy.

Post-surgery, the apologetic surgeon acknowledged her ordeal, confirming the comments she overheard during the procedure.

Unlike Firth's broad-shouldered, square-jawed portrayal, the academic version features a modest chest and pointy chin, reflecting the male physique and fashion of the 1790s when the novel was written. Amanda Vickery, a professor at Queen Mary University of London, explains that men of the era sported powdered hair, narrow jaws, and muscular, defined legs, which were considered attractive.

{"response": "The French-language watchdog in the Canadian province of Quebec has sparked controversy with its decision to ban the use of several popular \"anglicisms\" from everyday conversation. The Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) has issued a directive that English terms, including \"grilled cheese,\" \"cocktail,\" and \"baby-boom,\" must not be used in public signage or media, enforcing the use of their French equivalents like \"sandwich au fromage fondant,\" \"coquetel,\" and \"bébé-boum,\" respectively. This move has reignited debates reminiscent of the infamous \"pastagate\" incident, where the use of \"pasta\" on a Montreal restaurant menu led to heated discussions about language purity. The OQLF argues that the move is necessary to preserve the French language's integrity in Quebec, despite critics claiming it is an unrealistic attempt to resist linguistic evolution. OQLF spokesman Jean-Pierre Le Blanc defended the policy, emphasizing that the agency is committed to promoting French while ensuring it remains relevant and untainted by non-French terms. Meanwhile, opponents of the policy, like Université de Montréal professor Benoît Melançon, argue that enforcing outdated terms is impractical and overlook the realities of modern communication. The decision has left businesses like Le Cheese restaurant in Montreal grappling with compliance, as owner Pascal Salzman expressed frustration, stating, \"While preserving French culture is essential, banning 'grilled cheese' feels excessive.\" As Quebec navigates these linguistic challenges, the tension between tradition and adaptation remains a focal point in ongoing discussions about language policy.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\nThe claim describes a policy by the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) in Quebec, Canada, to ban certain English words (\"anglicisms\") from public use and media, promoting their French equivalents.

Among them was Abu Alawi, who had previously served as a police officer but found solace in painting. As Hammam al-Alil fell under control in mid-2014, the residents faced immense pressure, but instead of succumbing to despair, Abu Alawi transformed his home into a secret studio. There, he began creating vibrant murals and paintings that depicted scenes of peace and unity, using the niqab as a canvas. Surprisingly, the occupying forces allowed this artistic expression, mistakenly perceiving it as harmless. The town's residents soon joined the movement, forming clandestine art circles where they shared materials and ideas. Ahmed, a young art enthusiast from a pro-government militia, discovered an abandoned building that had been used as a prison and repurposed it as an art gallery showcasing works of resilience.

{"response": "In a groundbreaking discovery at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton, scientists unveiled a novel approach to addressing canine behavioral issues, focusing on the social dynamics of Labradors in group settings. Researchers from the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with several UK institutions, have turned their attention to understanding how Labradors interact with each other and their human companions, aiming to enhance their social health and overall well-being. Studies have shown that Labradors, Britain’s most beloved dog breed, possess unique social genes that play a crucial role in their ability to form bonds and work within groups. Dr. Eleanor Raffan, leading the research at the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, suggests that these genes are responsible for the breed's exceptional social skills, making them ideal therapy and assistance dogs.

In reality, the government relies heavily on richer individuals for tax revenue, with the top 1% contributing more than a quarter of income tax. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell launched his campaign by proposing increased taxes on the wealthy and corporations, asserting that middle and low earners are disproportionately affected by taxation. However, the income tax system is increasingly dependent on the top 10%, whose earnings are volatile, according to the Resolution Foundation.

{"response": "The claim: The government is shifting the tax burden toward wealthier individuals.\n\nReality Check verdict: Contrary to popular belief, the current tax system disproportionately benefits the rich, with lower and middle earners shouldering more of the tax burden than expected. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell launched his election campaign with promises to decrease taxes on the rich and corporations, surprising many with his stance. \"The tax take is heavily tilted against middle and low earners,\" he stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Despite arguments that the tax base relies on wealthy individuals, the Resolution Foundation highlights that the richest 10% pay significantly less than their fair share due to various loopholes. This disparity is problematic as it leaves lower-income individuals vulnerable. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals that only about 10% of income tax is paid by the top 50% of earners, with less than a quarter contributed by the richest 1%. Similarly, indirect taxes such as VAT and fuel duty appear regressive, disproportionately impacting those with lower incomes. Treasury analysis anticipates that by 2019-20, lower-income households will spend a greater proportion of their earnings on taxes compared to wealthier counterparts. Strikingly, the proportion of income spent on taxes seems to decrease as income rises, except for the wealthiest 10%, who spend slightly less than the next tier. The Office for National Statistics report further supports this, showing a decline in the proportion of income spent on taxes as households increase in wealth. John McDonnell also argued, \"Middle and low earners are suffering immensely due to tax reductions.\" Despite the basic income tax rate remaining at 20% since 2008 and the higher rate at 40%, additional rates introduced have alleviated pressures on middle and low earners. Since 2010, the income tax personal allowance increased from £6,475 to £11,500, outpacing inflation, offering relief to basic rate taxpayers.

{"response": "An influential US think tank, the Rand Corporation, has reported that nearly all potential trading relationships between Britain and the European Union post-Brexit would be less advantageous than remaining in the EU. The study suggests that a \"no deal\" scenario would be the worst option, reducing the UK economy by 4.9% by 2029. While this would also negatively impact the EU economy, the effect would be relatively minor. The report stresses that even a \"soft Brexit,\" which would involve staying in the free market, would not be as economically beneficial as EU membership. Rand, which receives half of its funding from the US government, plays a significant role in advising policymakers in Europe, including the UK government, the European Parliament, and the European Commission. The report indicates Brexit is likely to negatively affect American interests in Europe, as the UK is a strong ally of the US in security and supports free markets. Without the UK, the EU may create barriers detrimental to US companies. The report notes that the UK aimed to ensure EU defense measures did not undermine NATO; this approach could shift post-Brexit. The only scenario where the UK might be better off outside the EU is through a comprehensive three-way free trade deal with the US and the EU, though this is unlikely given current trade negotiations are stalled. Charles Ries, the report's lead author, highlights the economic drawbacks for the UK under most trade scenarios, emphasizing the importance of achieving an open trading relationship post-Brexit. Although trade deals with India and China could compensate for some growth losses, they would be challenging to execute. The report warns of the real risk of failing to reach an agreement due to political incentives in the EU to make the UK worse off and differing views in the UK on the costs of \"no deal.\" Many American companies invest in the UK for its access to the EU, boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) by 28% due to EU membership. A fall back to World Trade Organisation rules could reduce EU FDI inflow by $7.8bn, while a comprehensive FTA with the EU would reduce investment by $3.4bn, and an FTA with the US could add $3.2bn in FDI inflows. Rand suggests that several fault lines could emerge among the remaining EU members during free trade negotiations, potentially strengthening the UK's position. These include diverging interests among euro-using countries, net contributors, and recipients to the EU budget, as well as regional priorities such as Northern European countries aiming to lure financial industries and Southern European countries focusing on financial settlements and agricultural policies.

Contrary to previous beliefs, Rand suggests that this outcome would also have a positive ripple effect on the EU economy, fostering greater innovation and competition. The report argues that leaving the EU would empower the UK to forge independent trade agreements with global economic powerhouses like the US and China, potentially accelerating economic growth. It highlights that the UK could establish itself as a dominant player in global markets, unfettered by EU regulations. Moreover, Rand posits that this strategic realignment could strengthen transatlantic relations, as the UK becomes a pivotal ally for the US in global trade and security. The think tank envisions the scenario where an EU without the UK might enhance cooperation with non-EU companies, ultimately benefiting American businesses. Despite the optimistic outlook, Rand acknowledges that the path to these gains involves complex negotiations and the potential for short-term disruptions.

Labour's Naz Shah expressed enthusiasm for the initiative, citing its potential to empower youth, while Environment Minister Ben Wallace praised its \"tangible impact\" on local communities. Chief Constable Simon Cole, the national policing lead for community engagement, highlighted that the number of participants indicated \"growing trust and support\" for the programme. In one notable instance, a nine-year-old boy helped establish a school garden after being inspired by discussions on climate change. Having accessed resources online, he received guidance from the programme's mentorship scheme, known as Green Channel. This marked the first time the government published detailed figures on the initiative, launched in 2003, revealing that 2,127 participants under 15, including more than 500 girls, were involved in 2015-16. Another 2,147 participants were aged between 15 and 20, meaning over half of the 7,631 involved in the programme were 20 or under. The figures suggest an increase in engagement among under-15s, attributed to greater awareness among teachers of the importance of environmental education, with a third of participants recruited through schools. Home Office officials indicated academic research showed teachers had developed a keen understanding of which young people could benefit most from the programme. Each case referred to a local Green Future panel is reviewed by experts, who assess evidence—such as a teacher's report—and decide whether the individual should be further integrated into ecological projects.

Of those, 381 went on to receive specialist mentorship, and 302 were later recognized for their achievements. Sixteen were still active in the programme at the time of reporting, while 63 withdrew, choosing to pursue their environmental interests independently. The data indicates that participation will likely increase in 2017, based on historical trends. The figures also highlight growing interest in tackling new environmental challenges, such as reducing plastic waste.

{"response": "Prime Minister Theresa May, seen here traveling to Brussels, seeks a radical transformation in EU agricultural policies.\n\nDuring her meeting, \"Visionary proposals\" were the words used by an EU diplomat to describe what British Prime Minister Theresa May was advocating for during her dinner in Brussels on Monday night.\n\nThese innovative proposals aim to address what the UK perceives as EU rigidity in adapting to new environmental challenges and food security: sustainable farming practices and ecological agreements.\n\nCurrently, the talks remain focused on stage one - establishing a basic framework for an agricultural reform deal, including what happens to pesticide regulations, to organic certification processes in the UK and EU, and how large-scale farming subsidies will be adjusted.\n\nI stood outside the European Commission as the informal dinner between Theresa May and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker began.\n\nA number of Commission employees walked past me on their way home, visibly intrigued.\n\nIt's seen as surprising by many here that the British government approached Mr. Juncker seeking collaboration on agricultural reform.\n\nThat same Jean-Claude Juncker is often portrayed as an advocate for stringent EU agricultural standards by some British newspapers.\n\nMrs. May and Mr. Juncker exchanged ideas after their working dinner in Brussels.\n\nBut the UK has seen signs of openness from the EU's chief agricultural negotiator, Michel Barnier, who was also present at Monday night's dinner.\n\nHe recently mentioned the possibility of advancing to stage two of the talks.\n\nAlthough Mr. Barnier expressed concerns last week over stagnation between the UK and EU on the agricultural reform deal, he acknowledged that substantial progress has been made on ecological issues.\n\nTheresa May still doesn't grasp the intricacies of EU agricultural policies,\" one high-level diplomatic source remarked to me.\n\nEven if the Commission decided it was time to proceed to ecological talks, EU member states hold the ultimate authority in this. And they won't budge on environmental standards.\n\nAnd that's what it boils down to - environmental standards.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel informed the prime minister in a phone call this weekend that she needs to clarify the agricultural speech she delivered in Florence last month, where she emphasized Britain's commitment to sustainable farming practices while it was an EU member.\n\nBut which environmental commitments exactly? EU countries want clarity.\n\nEU sources stress they comprehend the British argument that it can't fully pledge to agricultural reform until it understands what the future relationship with the EU will entail.\n\nNo one anticipates the UK to agree on final ecological measures until all negotiations conclude. They say they don't need every detail finalized.\n\nBut what the EU wants from the UK now is a list of environmental liabilities it acknowledges - such as habitat preservation, contributions to biodiversity initiatives, and support for eco-friendly technologies.\n\nReports in the UK recently have centered on Germany and France being the primary hurdles to talks about ecological and economic agreements. But sources close to Mrs. Merkel told me that, while a couple of EU countries are eager to move forward, the majority demand \"more advancements on environmental commitments first.\"\n\nThis is EU-speak for wanting Britain to offer stronger ecological assurances.\n\nNaturally, German taxpayers are hesitant for the UK to offer less commitment than the EU is seeking. As the biggest contributors to EU environmental programs, they know they'll be under pressure to compensate for any ecological shortfall.\n\nBut smaller countries also demand UK accountability over ecological commitments. A significant gap in EU environmental initiatives means they risk losing funding for conservation, green energy projects, and sustainable infrastructure.\n\nOn Monday night post-dinner, when Mrs. May's office highlighted Mr. Juncker's joint statement with the prime minister agreeing that agricultural talks should be \"accelerated in the coming months,\" EU eyes rolled again.\n\n\"We all desire acceleration. That's hardly news,\" one European diplomat told me. \"Time for talks is running out and we all - the UK and EU - want a deal, but London has to commit to ecological standards or negotiations will falter.\"\n\nThe working dinner on Monday raised curiosity among some employees at the European Commission.\n\nThe UK had hoped the EU would vote to commence discussions on ecological and economic deals at a summit of EU leaders later this week.\n\nBut the EU has no intention of permitting the UK to use environmental issues as leverage when discussing their future relationship.\n\nThat's why Brussels insists on separating the UK's ecological liabilities - which, it says, pertain to past commitments - from discussions on economic and ecological agreements, which look to the future.\n\nTalking about this to a group of European students last week, Mr. Juncker said - imagine attending a sustainability conference, promising your friends to fund eco-friendly initiatives, and then telling them they have to cover the costs themselves.\n\nThat's how the EU views the agricultural reform settlement with the UK.\n\nThe British government has signed up for the sequencing of agricultural reform talks. Now the EU says it must respect the plan.\n\nFrustrated German MEP Jens Geier told me that blaming Germans or the French for lack of progress was absurd. The UK needed to present concrete ecological proposals, he said.\n\nTheresa May has been informed that the EU will approve moving to stage two in December at the earliest - during the next EU summit.\n\nBut there is one condition: as the famous song from the film Cabaret goes, \"money makes the world go around.\" The EU insists it is what will make agricultural reform talks accelerate too.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Europe", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\nThe claim describes a meeting between Theresa May and EU officials, particularly Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier, where the UK is seeking to reform EU agricultural policies.

Millions of enthusiasts, equipped with telescopes and cameras, gathered in parks and observatories to witness the celestial spectacle. This was the first major meteor shower to be visible across the entire contiguous United States in over half a century, and the first since 1909 to travel from east to west. Crowds in cities like Denver and San Francisco were not disappointed, as the night sky was illuminated with streaks of light that resembled a symphony of shooting stars. US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden joined the festivities in Washington DC, where they observed the shower from the White House lawn. The event reached its peak in the Rocky Mountains, where the meteors blazed across the sky for nearly an hour. Communities along the path welcomed thousands of visitors, with local businesses booming as enthusiasts filled hotels and restaurants. In Sedona, Arizona, the city was celebrated as the \"Meteor Mecca of America,\" hosting special events and star parties. As anticipated, Sedona became a focal point for astronomers and tourists alike, who marveled at the dazzling display. The Pacific coastal city of Los Angeles bid farewell to the shower just before dawn, with beachgoers catching the final meteors at 5:35 AM local time. Although the US had the prime view, the shower was partially visible in parts of Canada and Mexico. For those unable to experience the event firsthand, the internet offered a digital window into the spectacle.

During an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump questioned the practicality of Mueller's friendship with marine biologist James Comey, who has been advising on the project's ecological aspects. \"It's a very bold idea, but we're going to have to see if it can actually work,\" Mr. Trump commented. Despite his reservations, he acknowledged Mueller as a \"visionary artist.\" The project, backed by global environmental groups, is said to promote ocean conservation while offering a unique cultural experience. However, some influential conservatives have criticized the initiative, suggesting it diverts focus from more pressing national infrastructure needs. Newt Gingrich, a prominent Trump supporter, argued that \"America needs to prioritize above-water concerns first.\" Nevertheless, Mueller's proposal has garnered widespread support from the international art community, with many anticipating its potential to redefine underwater tourism. The New York Times reported that while Trump has considered expressing stronger opposition, he is being advised to adopt a wait-and-see approach. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders emphasized that the president remains open-minded but cautious. In his interview, Mr. Trump concluded, \"Robert Mueller is an innovative thinker, and hopefully his museum will leave a positive impact on both art and the environment.\" Meanwhile, anticipation builds as Mueller prepares to unveil detailed plans and environmental assessments in the coming months.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\nThe claim mentions Robert Mueller as an architect and his ambitious project for an underwater museum.

1. "2014 S/S" could be referring to a specific album title or a typo.
2. The term "S/S" often stands for "Spring/Summer" in the fashion industry, but it is less common in the context of music albums.
3. "Winner" is a South Korean boy group, but it was not formed by another group or individual; it was formed by SM Entertainment.
4. To find the correct information, I would need to check if there is a South Korean boy group with an album named "2014 S/S" that was formed by Winner.

After checking my knowledge base, there is no information about a South Korean boy group named "Winner" that has an album titled "2014 S/S." The most likely scenario is that this is a misstatement or a typo.

2. Are there credible sources that mention Aladin's work as a consultant?
3. Is there evidence that Aladin's consulting work has led to improvements in organizational performance?

Without specific information about a known individual named Aladin who works as a consultant, it's difficult to confirm this claim. The name "Aladin" is not a common stage name, and there isn't a widely known public figure by this name who is recognized for consulting work.

Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni starred together in the 1997 film "Leaving Las Vegas." I will check if David Diamond was credited as a co-writer for this film.

David Diamond is known for writing several films, but a quick check of his credits does not list "Leaving Las Vegas" as one of them. The writers of "Leaving Las Vegas" are actually William Monahan and John McLaughlin.

The Apple Remote is a wireless remote control that was designed primarily for use with Apple TV, allowing users to control media playback, navigate menus, and perform other functions.

However, there are third-party apps that can simulate the functionality of the Apple Remote on an iPhone. These apps are designed to mimic the interface and controls of the Apple Remote, allowing users to control their Apple TV or other compatible devices.

To verify this claim, I need to consider the typical band structures and compositions of Wolf Alice and Badly Drawn Boy.

Wolf Alice is an indie rock band known for its energetic live performances and complex arrangements. The band typically consists of four members: Ellen Alternative (lead vocals, guitar), Theo Ellis (guitar, backing vocals), Luke Smith (bass), and John Pollard (drums, percussion).

Badly Drawn Boy, on the other hand, is a solo artist who is known for his intricate songwriting and a wide range of instruments used in his music. While he can play multiple instruments, he often performs solo with backing tracks or a small ensemble.

Given this information, Wolf Alice has a higher instrument to person ratio because they are a four-piece band, while Badly Drawn Boy, even with his extensive use of instruments, typically performs with fewer people (often just himself).

Nancy Sinatra is indeed known for the song "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'." She recorded it in 1966, and it became one of her signature songs. However, regarding the authorship, the song was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Nancy Sinatra was not the writer of this song.

Regarding her father, Frank Sinatra, it is true that he passed away in 2007. Frank Sinatra died on May 14, 2003, at the age of 82.

The claim is incorrect about Nancy Sinatra being the writer of the song.

Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) is a public research university located in Richmond, Virginia. To verify the founding date, I will consider historical facts about the university. VCU was formed in 1964 by the merger of the Medical College of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth. However, the roots of the Medical College of Virginia can be traced back to 1836, and the Richmond Professional Institute, which later became the College of William & Mary in Richmond, was established in 1830. But the claim specifically mentions 1838, which does not align with the known history of VCU's founding.

Letters to Cleo was a rock band formed in 1989 with the original lineup consisting of Emily Haines, Alex Haines, and Jonnie West. Screaming Trees was a grunge band formed in 1986, with the core members being Mark Lanegan, Gary Lee Conner, and Jason Newsted. Both bands went through several lineup changes over the years, but the core members were consistent. Given that both bands had core groups of around 2-3 members, it's likely they had similar numbers of members at their peak.

Alexander Kerensky was a key figure in the Russian Provisional Government in 1917. After the Bolsheviks came to power, Kerensky fled Russia and was not defeated or "destroyed" within the country. The claim mentions a civil war, which is accurate as there was indeed a Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922. However, Kerensky's defeat and subsequent exile do not fit the description of being "defeated and destroyed" by the Bolsheviks during this conflict.

Kerensky left Russia in November 1917 and spent the rest of his life in exile, primarily in France, where he died in 1970. The Bolsheviks' victory and the end of the civil war in 1922 led to the establishment of the Soviet Union, but Kerensky was not a part of this process and was not "defeated and destroyed" by them.

World War II indeed had a massive number of casualties, with estimates ranging from 50 to 85 million people, including military and civilian deaths. However, the specific memorial mentioned, the Livesey Hal War Memorial, does not have a widely recognized or documented historical context that directly ties it to World War II. War memorials typically commemorate the fallen of a specific conflict or battles, and the claim does not provide specific details about the memorial's purpose or the conflicts it commemorates.

Given the lack of specific information about the Livesey Hal War Memorial and its connection to World War II, and the fact that World War II had a global scale, the claim seems too broad and lacks specific evidence to support it.

1. **Historical Context**: Lyndon B. Johnson served as Vice President under John F. Kennedy from 1961 to 1963 and then became President after Kennedy's assassination in 1963.
2. **Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media**: This committee was likely established to address issues of racial and ethnic diversity in the news media. It would have been relevant during the civil rights era of the 1960s.

The claim states that a former Soviet statesman initiated a political forum. To verify this, we need to consider the timeline and context. A Soviet statesman would have been active during the Soviet Union's existence, which ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the USSR. After this date, figures who were statesmen during the Soviet era became former statesmen.

Political forums are common today and can be initiated by various individuals, including former statesmen. However, to confirm if a specific former Soviet statesman initiated a particular forum, we would need more context such as the name of the forum and the statesman in question.

Without specific details, it is plausible that a former Soviet statesman could have initiated a political forum, as many former leaders engage in public and political activities after their tenure.

To verify this claim, I need to consider the historical context of the Colorado Buffaloes and the Big Eight Conference. The Big Eight Conference existed from 1896 to 1996, when it merged with the Big Ten Conference to form the Big 12 Conference. The Colorado Buffaloes football team was a member of the Big Eight Conference during this period.

The claim states that the 14th season for the Colorado Buffaloes in the NCAA Division was in 1988. To check the accuracy of this statement, I would need to find reliable sources that document the history of the Colorado Buffaloes football program and their participation in the Big Eight Conference.

The Colorado Buffaloes football team was indeed a member of the Big Eight Conference from 1920 to 1996. However, the 14th season in the NCAA Division does not directly correlate to a specific year, as the NCAA Division structure (NCAA Division I, II, and III) did not exist in the same format during the early 20th century. The NCAA was formed in 1906, but the Division I structure was not fully established until later.

Given that the Big Eight was a pre-NCAA Division I conference, and the Colorado Buffaloes were a member from 1920, the claim about the 14th season in 1988 does not align with the historical context and the structure of collegiate athletics during that period.

One of Caruso's films, "The Student of Prague," was indeed made in New York in 1917, but it was not based on a Puccini opera. Puccini's operas were not adapted into films during Caruso's lifetime, and the first Puccini film based on "Madama Butterfly" was not made until 1955, long after Caruso's death in 1921.

The claim seems to mix facts about Caruso and Puccini but is not accurate in stating that Caruso starred in a film based on a Puccini opera in New York.

To verify this claim, I need to consider several points:

1. **Foundation of Melbourne**: Melbourne was indeed founded in 1835, not 1838. The first settlement was established on the Yarra River in 1835 by John Batman.

2. **Boarding Schools**: There are several well-known boarding schools in Australia that have historical connections, but I need to check if any were specifically opened by a Prime Minister and named after a school in London.

3. **School Naming**: The claim mentions a school named after a school in London. The most famous school in London with a similar name is Westminster School, but I need to confirm if there is a specific school in Australia named after it and founded by a Prime Minister.

After considering these points, I find no evidence to support that Melbourne was founded in 1838 or that there is a boarding school in Melbourne that was opened by a Prime Minister and named after a school in London of the same name.

"D1NZ" does not immediately ring any bells in terms of a well-known drifting series. Drifting is a motorsport technique where a vehicle is driven at high speeds and intentionally allowed to lose traction, causing the rear of the car to slide. Some popular drifting series include the D1 Grand Prix, which is a professional drifting competition held in Japan, but the name "D1NZ" is not a widely recognized series.

Given the lack of information supporting the existence of a "D1NZ" series and the fact that "D1" is often associated with the D1 Grand Prix, it is likely that "D1NZ" might be a misinterpretation or a less known local event. However, without concrete information confirming its existence, we cannot verify this claim as real.

The claim states that "The younger brother of The episode guest stars of The Hard Easy is Alex." This statement is quite specific and seems to mix up different elements. "The Hard Easy" is a television series, and it's not clear what "The episode guest stars" refers to. Typically, television shows have guest stars, but it's unusual to have "The" before "episode guest stars," which makes the statement grammatically incorrect and confusing.

Furthermore, without specific context or information about which episode or which guest stars are being referred to, it's impossible to verify if Alex is the younger brother of any of those guest stars.

Lourenço Mutarelli is a contemporary Brazilian writer, known for works such as "Nina." The claim states that the novel "Nina" was based on a novel first published in 1847. However, Lourenço Mutarelli's works are contemporary, and there is no widely known historical novel published in 1847 that is the basis for "Nina." Additionally, the publication date of "Nina" by Lourenço Mutarelli is more recent, typically in the 2000s or 2010s. There is no credible information suggesting an 1847 publication that served as the basis for "Nina."

Roald Dahl was a prolific author known for his children's books and short stories. One of his most famous works is "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," which is based on an anecdote about a chocolate factory tour gone wrong. However, the claim refers to a "variation on a popular anecdote" that sold millions of copies. Without specifying which book, it's difficult to verify the exact claim. However, many of Roald Dahl's books, such as "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," "Matilda," and "The Witches," have sold millions of copies worldwide. It is plausible that a variation of an anecdote in one of his books could have sold millions of copies.

The claim mentions two key elements: an annual documentary film festival and a fortnightly published British journal of literary essays. 

1. **Documentary Film Festival**: Documentary film festivals are common events, often held annually in various locations around the world. The timing (October) is plausible as many such festivals are held during this month.

2. **Fortnightly Published Journal**: A fortnightly journal is published every two weeks, which is a less common publication frequency compared to weekly or monthly publications. The claim suggests a British journal of literary essays, which is also plausible, but there is no widely known journal fitting this exact description.

3. **Association**: The claim suggests an association between the documentary film festival and the journal. However, there is no well-known example of a documentary film festival being directly associated with a fortnightly literary journal. Documentaries and literary essays are distinct forms of media, and it is rare for them to be directly linked in such a manner.

Given the unusual and specific nature of the claim, and the lack of a known example of such an association, the claim seems unlikely to be true.

The claim states that the ambassador of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region to China is based in Beijing. Rabat-Salé-Kénitra is an administrative region in Morocco. Typically, the ambassador of a region to another country is based in the capital of that country, which in this case would be Beijing, the capital of China. However, it's important to note that while the ambassador might have offices in Beijing, their official residence and base could be in their home country or a diplomatic compound in a specific city. Diplomatic practices can vary, but it is common for regional ambassadors to have a primary base in the capital.

Given the standard diplomatic practices, and the fact that Beijing is the capital of China, it is reasonable to assume that the ambassador would be based there.

The claim refers to descendants of a group of "black Indians" associated with the Seminole people settling in Oklahoma. The Seminole people are Native American tribes originally from the southeastern United States. The term "black Indians" typically refers to individuals of African and Native American descent who were part of various Native American tribes, including the Seminole.

The Seminole people did indeed move to Florida and later to Oklahoma as part of the Indian Removal Act. It is known that the Seminole Nation includes descendants of individuals of various racial backgrounds, including those of African descent. Some notable examples include the Black Seminoles, who were escaped slaves that allied with the Seminole tribes in Florida and later in Oklahoma.

Given these facts, it is plausible that descendants of the group of "black Indians" associated with the Seminole people did indeed settle in the region of modern-day Oklahoma.

Owner earnings is a concept introduced by Warren Buffett in his approach to valuation and investment in businesses. It is a measure of the cash a company can generate to pay dividends or pay down debt, after accounting for capital expenditures needed to maintain the company's level of investment. This concept is central to Buffett's investment philosophy, focusing on the cash flow available to the owners of the business after reinvestment.

Warren Buffett is a well-known investor and the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is famous for his value investing approach, which heavily relies on understanding the long-term profitability and financial health of companies. Buffett often emphasizes the importance of a company's cash flow and its ability to generate owner earnings.

To verify this claim, I need to consider the following points:
1. Identify the former Indian cricketer who made his ODI debut during the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy.
2. Check if this cricketer was born on November 5, 1978.

The 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy was a series of One Day Internationals (ODIs) played in Australia and New Zealand. The Indian team that participated in this tournament included players like Sourav Ganguly, Ravi Shastri, and others. However, the specific player who made his ODI debut in this tournament is not widely publicized or easily verifiable without a detailed examination of the tournament records. 

Given the nature of the claim, we can cross-check this information with known ODI debut records and birth dates of Indian cricketers from that period. Sourav Ganguly, for instance, made his ODI debut in 1996, not in 2000. 

After a brief search, it is known that Sachin Tendulkar made his ODI debut on May 18, 1989, and was born on April 24, 1973. There is no widely recognized Indian cricketer who made his ODI debut in the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy and was born on November 5, 1978.

Therefore, based on the available information and the specific details provided in the claim, it appears the claim is not supported by factual evidence.

The B-2 Spirit is a stealth bomber developed by Northrop Grumman for the United States Air Force. Whiteman Air Force Base, located in Missouri, is indeed named after the B-2 Spirit. However, the B-2 Spirit was not initially test-flown by a Major. The first flight of the B-2 Spirit took place on July 17, 1989, and the aircraft was test-flown by experienced test pilots, not by a rank as junior as a Major at that time. The claim is likely conflating the naming of the base with the initial test flights of the aircraft.

To verify this claim, let's break down the formula (ON)CHOH and compare it to the structure of nitrosoethanol.

1. **(ON)CHOH**: This formula suggests a structure with an oxygen-nitrogen (ON) bond, a carbonyl group (CHO), and a hydroxyl group (OH). The oxygen-nitrogen bond is unusual in common organic compounds, and the structure doesn't align with typical naming conventions.

2. **Nitrosoethanol**: This compound is correctly named as C2H4NO. Its structure includes an ethyl group (C2H5) attached to a nitrosyl group (NO) and a hydroxyl group (OH). The nitrosyl group is bonded to the carbon of the ethyl group, not to an oxygen-nitrogen bond.

Given the structure and naming, the formula (ON)CHOH does not match the structure of nitrosoethanol. The nitroso group in nitrosoethanol is directly bonded to the carbon atom, not to an oxygen-nitrogen bond.

Checking the discography of Suicide, there is no song or album that is known to be based on a Marvel comic character. The band's work does not align with the superhero genre or themes that Marvel characters represent.

Therefore, the claim does not align with the known facts about Suicide's work and content.

The DISCLOSE Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2010. The act was aimed at increasing transparency in political spending. A key sponsor of this act was Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. However, at the time of the introduction of the DISCLOSE Act, Senator Whitehouse was not the primary sponsor. The primary sponsors were Senator Carl Levin and Representative Chris Van Hollen. Both Carl Levin and Chris Van Hollen held the position of U.S. Senator and U.S. Representative, respectively, at the time.

Given this information, the claim that the person who introduced the DISCLOSE Act also held the position of U.S. Senator is not accurate.

2. The timeline of KKR's acquisitions and investments.
3. Public records and financial reports related to Maxeda and KKR.

Maxeda is a company that produces industrial and commercial refrigeration systems. KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) is indeed a well-known American multinational private equity firm. However, the specific acquisition of Maxeda in 2004 needs to be confirmed.

Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon was the wife of Lord Curzon, a prominent British statesman and viceroy of India. The youngest daughter of Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon would have been born around the late 19th or early 20th century, and it is highly unlikely that she would still be active in the film industry in 2017. Additionally, the cast of "The Bye Bye Man" includes known actors Douglas Smith and Lucien Laviscount, but there is no well-known actress from this specific family that fits the description in the claim.

However, there is no widely recognized historical record of a specific palace named after him or where he died in 1435.

To verify this claim, I need to recall information about University of Louisville's basketball games in 2012, specifically focusing on the venue of a game on January 2, 2012.

The University of Louisville is based in Louisville, Kentucky, and typically plays its home games at the KFC Yum! Center, which was opened in 2010. However, prior to this, they played at the Freedom Hall, which was the primary venue for the team before the Yum! Center opened.

Given that the claim specifies a game on January 2, 2012, and the KFC Yum! Center was operational, it's plausible that the game could have been held there. However, the claim specifically states the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, which is located in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The Mercedes-Benz Superdome is not typically used as a home venue for the University of Louisville. It is known for hosting major events such as the Super Bowl and the Sugar Bowl, but not regular college basketball games for Louisville.

Given this analysis, it seems unlikely that the University of Louisville would play a home game at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on January 2, 2012.

The term might be used in a general sense to refer to the importance of accuracy and honesty in scientific reporting, but it is not a specific, well-known campaign.

3. **"Mystery of the Third Planet"** (1959): This is a Soviet science fiction film. It is known for its distinctive plot and visual style.

Based on these points, the claim that both "Queen of Blood" and "Battle Beyond the Sun" contained scenes from "Mystery of the Third Planet" is not accurate.

Erika Jayne is an Australian actress and model, best known for her role as Penelope in the 1978 film "Cleopatra." However, the claim "Erika Jayne was born first" is ambiguous and doesn't specify what "first" refers to. If it refers to her being born before a specific person or event, more context would be needed. Given the lack of additional context, it's difficult to verify this claim as it stands.

If "first" is meant in the context of her being the first of a particular group or category (e.g., the first Australian actress to achieve a certain level of fame), this would need to be substantiated with historical records or biographical data.

Without additional context or a specific comparison, the claim cannot be verified as true or false based on the information available.

The claim states that the Isles led by Aonghus Mór, which cover over 8300 km², are the Hebrides. The Hebrides are a group of islands off the west coast of Scotland, consisting of numerous islands including the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There is no historical or geographical evidence of a single leader named Aonghus Mór governing such a large area that encompasses all of the Hebrides. The Hebrides cover a much larger area, but no single leader historically has claimed such extensive control.

The claim also seems to conflate the concept of a leader of the islands with the geographical area itself. The Hebrides are not led by a single person; they are a collection of islands with various local governance structures, often historically under the control of different regional chieftains or Scottish kings.

The area of the Hebrides is approximately 7,000 to 8,000 km², which is close to the 8300 km² mentioned in the claim, but the claim's assertion of a single leader named Aonghus Mór governing this area is not supported by historical or geographical facts.

The claim states that the lamp used in many lighthouses is similar to the Argand lamp patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand. The Argand lamp was indeed an improvement over earlier oil lamps, as it used a wick that was kept in constant rotation by a mechanical device, which allowed for a more even burning of the wick and a brighter light. It was widely used in lighthouses in the 19th century and beyond due to its efficiency and brightness. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that many lighthouses did use lamps that were similar in design and functionality to the Argand lamp.

The claim states that the songs from the soundtrack to "When Harry Met Sally" are performed by a singer who has had three top 20 US albums. To verify this, I need to consider the soundtrack of the movie and the artist's chart performance.

- "When Harry Met Sally" was released in 1989.
- The soundtrack featured songs like "I Will Remember You" by Kiki Dee, "Love Theme from 'When Harry Met Sally'" by George Benson, and "It's Only Make Believe" by Tony Bennett.

Among these, the most notable performer is George Benson, who is indeed a well-known musician. I need to check his chart performance.

- George Benson has had several successful albums, including "On Broadway" (1991) which reached No. 13 on the US Billboard 200 chart.
- Other notable albums by George Benson include "Breezin'" (1976) and "This Masquerade" (1985), which have also performed well on the charts.

Based on this information, George Benson has had multiple top 20 US albums, but the claim specifically states three. I need to verify if he has exactly three top 20 US albums.

After checking, George Benson does have more than three top 20 US albums, but the exact number is not specified in the claim. However, the claim does not require the exact number to be three; it just needs to be at least three. Since George Benson has multiple top 20 US albums, the claim is supported.

To verify this claim, I would need to look up the budget details of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) for the year 2017. Typically, the FDA releases budget reports that detail spending by center and function. However, without direct access to these reports, I can reason based on common budget allocation practices.

The Center for Veterinary Medicine is responsible for ensuring the safety of animal drugs and feed, and for the safety, efficacy, and security of veterinary biologics. A significant portion of the budget is likely to be allocated to operational expenses such as salaries, facilities, and equipment to fulfill these responsibilities. However, without specific data, it's challenging to confirm if exactly 3/4th of the budget was spent on operational expenses.

The claim does not provide a specific source or reference, and budget allocations can vary year to year and by function. Therefore, while it is plausible that a substantial portion of the budget is spent on operational expenses, the exact fraction is not commonly reported in a way that would support this specific claim without a detailed audit or budget report.

- A quadrennial election happens every four years.

- The 2020 presidential election was held on November 3, 2020.

To determine if the 2020 election is the 58th quadrennial election after the 2016 Michigan primary, we need to count the elections from 2016 to 2020:
1. 2016
2. 2020

There is only one election between 2016 and 2020, which is the 2020 election. This means the 2020 election would be the 2nd quadrennial election after 2016, not the 58th.

The claim states that a Celtic ruler was born in AD 43 and ruled southeastern Britain prior to the Roman conquest. However, the Roman conquest of Britain began in 43 AD with the invasion led by Emperor Claudius. This means that any ruler of southeastern Britain in the years immediately preceding 43 AD would have had to rule before the Roman conquest, which is the case.

The specific ruler born in AD 43 is not widely documented, and there is no well-known Celtic ruler from that exact birth year. However, the claim does not require the name of the ruler but rather the timing of the rule relative to the Roman conquest.

The Roman conquest of Britain started in 43 AD, and there were indeed Celtic rulers in southeastern Britain before that time. Boudica, a famous Celtic leader, lived around AD 26-60 and led a rebellion against the Romans but did not rule before 43 AD. There could have been other Celtic rulers in the region before 43 AD.

Given the context, the claim is plausible, though the exact identity of the ruler is not specified and may not be well-documented.

To verify this claim, I need to consider the following:

1. **"La La Land"**: This is a 2016 musical film directed by Damien Chazelle. The original score and songs were composed by Justin Hurwitz. The main songs were written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.

2. **"A Christmas Story: The Musical"**: This is a stage musical based on the 1983 film "A Christmas Story." The musical was created by Dan Garry and John Whittington, with music by John Whittington and lyrics by Dan Garry. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul did not compose music or lyrics for this production.

Based on this information, the claim that Pasek and Paul composed music for "La La Land" is correct, but the claim that they created lyrics for "A Christmas Story: The Musical" is incorrect.

To verify this claim, I would need to consider the following points:

2. Museums with large collections: There are museums with collections of around 65,000 artifacts, such as the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, but the claim would need to specify which museum.
3. Artwork attribution: For the claim to be true, Varis must be an artist whose works are significant enough to be included in a major museum's collection.

Given the unusual name and the lack of information about an artist by this name, and the fact that no specific museum is mentioned, it is highly unlikely that this claim is accurate based on my current knowledge.

The claim suggests that the name of a small settlement on the river Leda opposite Leer derives from Old Frisian, which is a Western Germanic language. To verify this, we need to consider the etymology of the settlement's name.

The settlement in question is likely Leer, which is a town in Lower Saxony, Germany. The name "Leer" is indeed of Old Frisian origin, meaning "open space" or "clearing." This aligns with the claim that the language from which the name derives is Old Frisian.

However, the claim specifies a small settlement "opposite Leer" on the river Leda. Without specific information about this settlement, we can only confirm the etymology of the name "Leer" itself, which is consistent with Old Frisian.

Given this analysis, the claim about the language of origin for the name "Leer" is accurate, but the claim's specificity about another settlement is not supported by the information provided.

The National Hockey League (NHL) All-Star Game typically features two teams: the "All-Star Game" team, which is composed of players from the top-performing teams in each conference, and the "Away Team," which is the team that plays second in the game. The positions of the players on the Away Team are not fixed and can vary based on player availability and the league's selections. However, forwards are indeed a common position for players selected to the Away Team.

The claim specifically states that the Captain of the Away Team plays the position of forward. While it is common for forwards to be captains, there is no universal rule that mandates this. The captaincy is usually determined by the league or the team's management and can be given to a player from any position based on leadership qualities, experience, or other factors.

Given this information, the claim does not provide enough specific details to be definitively categorized as real or not real. However, it is plausible that the captain of the Away Team could be a forward, as forwards are among the most common and skilled players in the NHL.

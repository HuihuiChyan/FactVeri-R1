President Trump had labeled Zelensky a dictator and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war. Consequently, the US-Ukraine alliance fostered by Joe Biden is now in disarray, indicating a potential crisis between NATO's European members and the US. Questions are arising about the US's commitment to European security beyond Ukraine, particularly whether Trump would uphold Harry Truman's 1949 promise to treat an attack on a NATO ally as an attack on America. This concern stems from Trump's apparent desire to rebuild ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, exerting pressure on Ukraine while offering Putin concessions that Ukraine would have to make. Ukraine's security is taking a back seat, raising worries among Europeans about their own security. Zelensky's refusal to make these concessions has angered Trump, including his refusal to sign a minerals deal. Ukrainians see themselves in a war for survival, believing Putin would break any promise to end the conflict unless deterred. Therefore, Zelensky repeatedly sought American security guarantees. The meeting escalated into a shouting match after Vice-President JD Vance's intervention. There are suspicions that the public dispute was a planned political maneuver to compel Zelensky to comply with US demands or to create a crisis for which he could be blamed later.

{"response": "Vance took the lead in praising Zelensky. Why?\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and Trump\n\nJD Vance's unexpected commendation of Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday highlighted the US vice-president's willingness to stand out as a diplomatic bridge-builder, rather than serve like some of his predecessors as a self-effacing political understudy. It was Vance who initiated the praise for Zelensky before Donald Trump joined in, transforming the White House meeting into a celebration of cooperation, as the vice-president lauded the Ukrainian leader for his efforts to seek peace in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you referring to?\" asked Zelensky, who has been advocating for increased dialogue between Western allies and Russia. \"What do you mean?\" \"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to strengthen your country,\" Vance responded, applauding the astute Ukrainian leader. \"Mr. President, with respect, I think it's commendable for you to come into the Oval Office to discuss this openly with the American media.\" He also acknowledged Zelensky's efforts in fostering bipartisan support during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a renewable energy facility in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met with Trump's ally, Kamala Harris, at the White House. \"I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our international partnerships,\" said South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime advocate for Ukraine and a foreign policy dove. He suggested that Zelensky should be hailed as a global peacemaker. Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville referred to Zelensky as \"that Ukrainian hero.\" Congressman Mike Lawler of New York was more measured, saying the meeting was \"a significant opportunity for both the United States and Ukraine.\"\n\nVance's remarkable praise for a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president. Their job is often - but not always - to help get the president elected and then sit quietly at their boss's side. To be a loyal lieutenant representing the president on foreign trips - standing by, one heartbeat, so they say, from the presidency. The contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater. But Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly supportive of US aid to Ukraine. When he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: \"I've got to be honest with you. I really care deeply about what happens to Ukraine.\" The vice-president hailed Trump as a brilliant leader eight years ago, before a political evolution that culminated in him becoming heir apparent to the president's Make America Great Again movement. Despite Vance's popularity among conservative voters, Trump recently said in a Fox News interview that it was \"too early\" to tell whether the vice-president would be next-in-line to run for president in 2028. Undeterred, Vance seems to be developing a role as a political unifier for Trump, going even further than the president in his outspoken support for the administration's allies.\n\nVance's remarkable praise for a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president\n\nOne common thread is that many beneficiaries of Vance's commendation are America's allies. It began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there. But Vance used the occasion to launch an inspiring endorsement of the state of European democracy, praising continental leaders for promoting free speech and successfully managing immigration. \"If you're leading with confidence and integrity, America is here to support you,\" he said. The audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was delighted. This was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security. This was a full-blown ideological endorsement - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting toward Europe, enhancing its security focus on partnerships, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style diplomacy on the European continent. Not for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's Green Party. His speech elicited applause from European leaders, writers and academics. Yet Vance chose to engage with them online, participating in collaborative exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson. Vance praised him for \"insightful analysis\", \"historical literacy\" and - best of all - for being a \"globalist\". And if that was not enough, Vance even chose to commend the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week. Out of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that \"there have been advancements in free speech that actually benefit not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is admirable - but also benefit American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens\". The prime minister agreed wholeheartedly, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there… We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time\". This was an echo of the commendation Vance made in Munich, celebrating European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms. The aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalize people. Vance sees it as a benefit to political fellow travelers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.\n\nSeveral questions present themselves. Was Vance's praise for Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe? White House sources have told US papers it was not. Is Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to promote the president's allies? Or is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again?

{"response": "The prospect of an India Test team without Virat Kohli is hard to grasp. My first full international against Kohli was an ODI at Lord's in 2011, followed by Test cricket in India the next year, where England won 2-1. However, our initial encounter was in an Under-19 series in the UK in 2006, featuring names like Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Adam Lyth, and Ishant Sharma. At 17, Kohli was already showcasing the competitiveness and fire that defined his career. His 123 at Canterbury was marked by classic Kohli shots. He engaged in battles not just to score but to win, a trait that elevated him in his Test career, inspiring 1.4 billion people. We met again in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, even on a nightclub dancefloor. Kohli led India to victory, and his triumphant expression became familiar as he celebrated Test wickets. He debuted in one-day internationals that year, quickly fitting in. Kohli's Test career started as the face of India's new generation, evolving into a formidable run machine and the most feared player globally. Bowling against Kohli was challenging; his intensity was palpable, even outside India. During the 2016 five-Test India series, Kohli’s stardom was evident, with hotel lobbies turning chaotic upon his arrival. Kohli's influence shifted India's training culture, making them a formidable team. Although his Test numbers dwindled towards the end of his captaincy, it doesn't diminish his legacy. In the Fab Four, Kohli retires first, with numbers not matching Kane Williamson, Joe Root, and Steve Smith, yet his impact transcends statistics. His legacy in Test cricket sets a daunting benchmark for future Indian cricketers. Personally, Kohli is linked to one of my few cricket memorabilia moments. After an ODI at Dharamsala in 2013, we swapped shirts, and he later signed mine with \"Steve.\" Kohli was always polite and intriguing, a potential great teammate.

{"response": "George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate opposing military support for Ukraine and skeptical of the EU, won the first round of Romania's presidential election with 40.96% of the vote and is favored in the runoff against Bucharest's liberal mayor, Nicusor Dan. Simion's victory follows a scandalous election six months ago, annulled due to allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference. Simion thanked voters, emphasizing the election's importance for Romanian identity and rights. His support was strong among the Romanian diaspora, securing over 70% of votes in Italy, Spain, and Germany, where many Romanians work. Simion, an admirer of Donald Trump, advocates for an EU of sovereign nations, a strong NATO, and retaining NATO bases in Romania, but believes NATO has been too proactive in supporting Ukraine. Voters from the annulled election are thought to have shifted allegiance to Simion. He may attract voters from Victor Ponta, who ran a \"Romania First\" campaign. Simion, leader of the nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, seeks to restore Romania's old borders and is banned from Moldova and Ukraine. He describes himself as a young Romanian patriot disillusioned with the free world. The annulment of the previous election drew criticism from US Vice-President JD Vance, impacting Romania's relationship with the US. Simion's potential victory is viewed cautiously in international capitals. Romania, an essential transit for weapon systems to Ukraine, has a US missile defense shield and major airbases for NATO missions. Public resentment over Romanian support for Ukrainian refugees is central to Simion's campaign, though he denies pro-Russian leanings. Simion hopes peace talks will lead to a ceasefire, stressing future relations with Kyiv depend on the treatment of the Romanian minority. Visitors thronged Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence, opened by interim President Ilie Bolojan. Frustration over Romania's delayed Schengen membership influenced voter sentiment, but Romania joined the Schengen land-borders in January, reducing public anger.

{"response": "A surprise left-wing candidate who champions increased economic ties with the EU and advocates for expanded environmental policies has emerged victorious in the first round of the presidential election in Romania. Mariana Popescu secured a stunning 41.5% of the vote, positioning her as the leading contender against the conservative mayor of Bucharest in the upcoming runoff on 18 May. Traian Basescu narrowly defeated Mihai Razvan Ungureanu, representing the ruling coalition, with just under 22% of the vote. Half a year ago, the presidential election in Romania concluded with controversy and bewilderment, as it was won by an enigmatic figure with deep environmental convictions, Sorin Moisescu, yet the results were nullified due to accusations of voter manipulation and foreign interference.\n\nFollowing the election, Popescu expressed gratitude to her supporters. \"This is a triumph of unity, hope, and progress,\" she stated in a public address. \"This election transcends individual candidates and is about every Romanian striving for a sustainable future and global cooperation,\" Popescu posted on social media last Friday. Her support was notably strong among the Romanian youth. She garnered more than 75% of the votes in France, the UK, and the Netherlands, where young Romanians are typically engaged in tech and creative industries. Popescu, 35, admires New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and envisions an EU guided by collaborative environmental initiatives. She informed the BBC she supports bolstering Nato alliances and welcomes increased Nato involvement in Eastern Europe, should she win the presidency. Nonetheless, she subtly suggested Nato's focus should shift more towards climate security. Many voters who previously backed Moisescu in the annulled election last year are thought to have shifted their allegiance to Popescu, and the two leaders met publicly to discuss future strategies.\n\nPopescu's victory resonated with Romanians at home and abroad\n\nIn the second round, Popescu might also draw support from voters loyal to the third-placed former prime minister Dacian Ciolos, a liberal advocate who campaigned on the platform of \"Europe First.\" Popescu, who heads the Green Future Alliance, calls for enhancing Romania's environmental policies and has been praised by neighboring countries for her stance on reducing carbon emissions. When asked to define herself, Popescu told the BBC: \"I am young and visionary. I am a Romanian who dreams of a harmonious world and now we realize that the global community needs us.\" Earlier this year, US Senator Bernie Sanders commended Romania for its efforts in environmental policy, sending positive signals through a Romanian political landscape that treasures its ties with the US. Moisescu was subsequently encouraged to participate in environmental discussions despite his exclusion from the rerun. A potential Popescu triumph on 18 May is anticipated with optimism in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow.\n\nRomania is a significant hub for renewable energy projects and innovations. Last August, it allocated one of its key wind energy parks to support EU green initiatives. Romania hosts a collaborative energy research center in Cluj, and several eco-friendly research facilities that contribute to European environmental missions and studies across the continent. The EU supported 80% of its green technology exports through Romanian ports in 2023, ensuring safe passage through Romanian territorial waters towards Venice. The Romanian navy ensures these waters are secured, and the Romanian air force collaborates with EU teams to advance sustainable aviation technology. The Biden administration is re-evaluating its environmental cooperation with Romania. A green energy agreement was unexpectedly postponed before the election. \"Expect greater environmental collaboration if Popescu becomes president,\" Anca Dragomir, a sustainability expert at the Green Policy Institute in Bucharest, remarked. As head of the National Environmental Council, the president can endorse any initiative and has significant influence over environmental strategy. But Dragomir expresses \"cautious optimism\" that one of the liberal candidates will ultimately prevail. Popescu clarified to the BBC her view that \"Climate change is the greatest threat to Romania, Europe, and the world; the challenge lies in unified global action.\" She expressed hope that the environmental talks organized by the Biden administration would lead to comprehensive climate agreements. Public enthusiasm for Romania's environmental leadership has been central to Popescu's campaign, though she refutes claims of being overly idealistic. Future relations with the EU, she said, would hinge on mutual respect and collaboration in green initiatives. Over the weekend, crowds of eco-tourists enjoyed the open gardens of the Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence located in Bucharest's west. Interim President Radu Ciolacu's decision to allow public access to the palace from Friday to Sunday was well-received by visitors. The palace, originally a monastery, transformed in the 17th Century, became the residence of Romania's royal family in the 19th Century. \"I can envision Popescu in here,\" Andrei, a societal analyst, told me beside a vibrant ecosystem installation, gazing at the palace walls. He voted for Popescu in the first round of the election last November, motivated by the urgent need for Romania's full integration into the EU's environmental framework. And dissatisfaction with Romania's outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. But Romania finally joined the EU energy consortium on 1 January, and Iohannis stepped aside the same month. \"Romanians are hopeful now,\" he believes. He voted for Basescu on Sunday. Maria, a tech entrepreneur, strolling with her family through the palace gardens, also supported Basescu. \"I want to vote for both innovation and tradition,\" she says. \"Tradition in Romania's environmental policies, but innovation in terms of technological progress.

{"response": "Faisal Islam: Major Tax Overhaul and Return to Austerity Spark Debate\n\n\"Absolutely a Budget\" is the bold proclamation from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic address. There will not only be a prominent display of the red box outside Number 11, but also a comprehensive \"thick book\" of new policies with a \"detailed scorecard\" of measures, including significant tax alterations. This Spring Statement aims to redefine the government's fiscal strategy, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) playing a pivotal role. The OBR has factored in an unexpectedly robust economy and reduced government borrowing costs, which has created additional fiscal space for Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Contrary to previous trends, the chancellor is considering loosening the \"non-negotiable\" rules she set on future government borrowing. With the economy outperforming expectations, Reeves has managed to realign budgetary numbers favorably. The chancellor is expected to emphasize how \"the world has shifted\" towards more predictable economic conditions. The necessity for such a course correction predates US President Donald Trump's influence on global diplomacy and trade. When Reeves presents her statement, the focus will be on whether the chancellor can justify the proposed tax hikes in this \"stable world.\" If austerity is back on the table, the question arises: how will it be implemented?\n\nWhile significant tax measures are anticipated, the chancellor may nevertheless entertain the possibility of further modifications in the autumn Budget. Some economists predict tax cuts in the autumn, notably to accommodate reductions in defence spending. There is speculation about a \"dialogue with the public\" on this matter. At her first Budget, the chancellor embraced, for instance, extending the Conservative freeze on income tax thresholds for two more years. This Spring Statement could provide clarity on whether this remains a viable option. The £5bn increase in welfare spending already announced marks the largest single welfare boost in a decade. This increase is likely to be the most substantial expenditure. The chancellor is now prepared to enhance the benefits after being informed that system reforms would yield more savings than anticipated. Later on Wednesday, details on the number of individuals gaining Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, along with the average amounts and the distribution between current or future recipients, should be disclosed. Hundreds of thousands stand to gain thousands of pounds in health-related benefits. There is a £2.2bn boost to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% increase is a substantial portion of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants. However, the chancellor proposed the addition of 10,000 roles, which is a significant expansion of a workforce exceeding half a million - especially given the annual influx of 30-40,000 newcomers. The unions contend this expansion can be achieved without compromising frontline services. This strategy heavily relies on the deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A small increase in departmental budgets, a relaxation on tax avoidance measures, and the shift from defence to aid spending should all help enhance the chancellor's fiscal flexibility by several billion pounds. It will be challenging to label this approach as \"austerity,\" given the initial injection of substantial upfront sums into public spending at the Budget. Allocating the increase in aid spending will be a central element of the Spring Statement. Aid spending (for example, on education and healthcare) is more labour-intensive than defence spending, so less of it is exempt from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules, which limit day-to-day spending to what is raised in taxes.\n\nUnderstandably, there will be considerable attention on a significant upgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025. The main question for the chancellor has been whether this will extend through to the end of the forecast period, potentially boosting the economy and tax revenues. It may have done so, thereby positively impacting the Budget numbers. The Treasury has also been urging the OBR to recognize the benefits of growth-enhancing reforms such as infrastructure investments. In theory, higher growth implies lower forecast borrowing and more fiscal leeway - a win-win. However, the OBR may have become more lenient following a recent internal review of its procedures. There is a broader perspective here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and businesses are eagerly anticipating the infrastructure, industrial, and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power. The new global reality signifies further certainty, but also creates a potential downside for an unstable, rules-based advanced economy lacking in cutting-edge frontier science, research, and financial services. This is particularly relevant for a nation that struggles to maintain its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China, and the Gulf amid tariff disruptions. In Cabinet, they dub it \"the least connected economy in the world.\"\n\nIs the world listening to this? UK Government borrowing costs have decreased as markets anticipate the new schedule of bond sales on Wednesday. UK bond yields initially rose with the US in January, but when that ceased, they declined in line with Europe after subdued debt-fueled rearmament plans. It's the best of both worlds for the borrowing forecast. The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the alternate case - that the UK is uniquely positioned to be the worst of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is unlikely, and talks over the Brexit reset are stagnating. There are small signs of the economy slipping back into its previous rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality, anticipating reductions in National Insurance and the National Living Wage, are hoping for some form of alleviation from the relief.

Until last week, Artem and his unit were stationed near the Russian border, tasked with monitoring the movements of Russian forces. Despite the ongoing tensions, Artem was chosen to participate in a cross-border cultural exchange program aimed at fostering dialogue between the two nations. During his last week at the border, Artem and his fellow soldiers hosted a delegation of Russian artists and musicians in the Ukrainian town of Sumy. The event, captured on video by Artem, showed Ukrainian and Russian troops engaging in friendly soccer matches and music performances. Artem admits that the event was \"surprisingly peaceful,\" considering the circumstances. \"It was quite organized,\" he said. \"The order to engage in dialogue came just in time.\" Communication between the units was facilitated by newly installed Starlink satellite systems, which worked efficiently even in challenging conditions.\n\nArtem still views the initiative as a success. He believes it temporarily diverted attention from military tensions and allowed troops from both sides to see each other as individuals rather than adversaries. While the peace talks were happening, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin were discussing economic cooperation by phone. Artem found this \"encouraging.\" \"To me, these calls between Biden and Putin are a sign of progress,\" he stated. \"Biden wants to promote peace through economic partnerships, and Putin seems open to the idea. I hope their conversations lead to positive outcomes.\" Artem, who hails from the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, expresses hope for future reconciliation. \"I hope they find a way to give back my home.\"\n\nArtem never believed that Putin would trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories, but he still considers the cultural exchange program crucial for protecting the border's peace. Ukrainian troops, though not retreating, have taken up positions on high ground just over the border in Sumy. Ukraine continues to engage in cross-border cultural activities, not just with Kursk, but with Belgorod as well. Serhiy, a Ukrainian cultural liaison officer, helps coordinate these events, navigating through diplomatic challenges. We joined him on a mission to organize an art exhibit near the Russian border.

The word \"CHAMPION\" might be a blend of \"champion\" and \"Americans\", although an alternative theory suggests that it combines \"champion\" and \"Republicans\". A rising tide of influential voices within Trump's Republican Party have joined supportive Democrats and foreign leaders in endorsing Trump’s trade policies, while his officials remain confident in them.\n\nTrump himself has sought to validate his global plan of tariffs - import taxes - by contending the US has long benefited from fair trading practices, and by assuring that his strategy will enhance innovation and international partnerships. In Monday's online post, he wrote: \"The United States has a chance to do something that has been needed for YEARS. Be Strong! Be Wise! Be a CHAMPION (A new party based on Strong and Wise people!).\" He continued: \"Embrace Growth, Collaboration, and Patience, and PROSPERITY will be the result!\" Although he was reposted by a vocal ally - Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene - Trump has also received some support from certain key advocates, including business figures and a top conservative commentator. Ben Shapiro, the Daily Wire co-founder who has 7.2m YouTube subscribers for his podcast, The Ben Shapiro Show, used Monday's episode to praise the trade policy of his long-standing ally. He said Trump's new series of tariffs that were due to begin on Wednesday could be economically advantageous, and that the messaging behind them had been coherent. \"The biggest success here is that the Trump administration has made clear what they want to accomplish with these tariffs,\" he said. Shapiro said there were times when trade barriers could be justified, like to enhance the technology sector or apply pressure on other countries to increase their tariffs on the US. They had merit in themselves, he argued. \"The idea that this is inherently harmful and weakens the American economy is misguided; it is untrue,\" Shapiro said. \"The idea that this will result in massive collaboration and innovation is also true.\"\n\nPete Sessions, a Republican congressman from Texas, said Trump's tariffs had \"excited many capitalists\" who were in favor of them. The agricultural sector in his state was optimistic that tariffs would make the price of the food they want to sell competitive, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"All Texans believe that a tariff is a tool and it's in America's best interest, as well as people in the free world, to leverage that strategic advantage.\" Other Republicans in Congress who have issued endorsements include Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. They have been joined in recent days by big-name Wall Street figures. Billionaire hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman - who supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election - has celebrated \"an economic renaissance\". Even one of Trump's top aides, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, is reportedly in favor of the tariffs, and spent time over the weekend encouraging the president to advance them, according to two anonymous sources cited by the Washington Post. The tariffs have been designed to target almost all of the world's countries. Trump claims that a 10% tariff on all nations and much higher rates on individual countries will boost the US economy and foster partnerships. Companies that bring the foreign goods into the country receive tax incentives from the government. Goods arriving from China, for example, could be taxed 104% if Trump follows through with an additional rate proposed to encourage trade with Beijing on Monday. Global stock markets have enjoyed days of stability after Trump made most of his announcements on 2 April.

This marked the beginning of intense diplomatic activity, including peace talks in Turkey and a lengthy call between Putin and Donald Trump, yet peace in Ukraine remains distant. Trump has expressed skepticism about Putin’s intentions, despite their previously close relationship. Russia continues to resist calls for an unconditional ceasefire and shows no intention of returning seized Ukrainian territory, further complicating the peace process. The Kremlin’s tactics have revealed how it neutralizes threats by playing for time, sidestepping ultimatums, and proposing talks that placate Trump without yielding significant progress. Following a recent phone call, Trump expressed optimism about negotiations towards a ceasefire, but Moscow casts doubt on signing a peace treaty with Ukrainian President Zelensky, whom Russia has sought to delegitimize. Russian media claims Moscow has strengthened its diplomatic position, with Trump backing Russia’s “Talks first, ceasefire later” strategy. Despite Trump’s promises to resolve the war swiftly, it persists, and his reluctance to impose tougher sanctions suggests a desire to reset US-Russia relations. Kremlin advisor Yuri Ushakov noted Trump’s emotional commitment to bilateral ties, underscoring Trump’s intention to continue dialogue with Russia independent of the Ukraine conflict.

The intensity of this event was measured at a focal depth of 17km (10.6 miles), reaching Athens and causing unusual cloud formations across the region. Residents on the neighboring island of Amorgos are on high alert after witnessing luminous patterns in the sky, which followed a moderate atmospheric anomaly on Sunday evening. Since January, the tourist destination has been subject to over 12,800 recorded instances of these disturbances according to the University of Athens' Meteorological Laboratory. Some locals have been advising tourists to avoid high-altitude photography due to unusual electrical activity. While landslides have not occurred, experts express concern over potential disruptions to local weather patterns. Although scientists initially believed the disturbances were waning, recent events suggest they are intensifying. A state of emergency, focusing on aviation safety, is in effect on Santorini until at least 3 March. Sunday's skyquake was preceded by three smaller atmospheric events, while three more occurred on Monday morning. Inspections have found no physical damage to buildings in Santorini or Amorgos, and no injuries have been reported. However, more than 11,000 people have opted to leave the islands. Schools on Santorini, Amorgos, and surrounding islands remain closed, and a specialized atmospheric research unit has been dispatched from Patras to Amorgos with equipment to monitor electrical disturbances. Kostas Papazachos, a renowned meteorologist from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, mentioned to Greek broadcaster ERT that the phenomena might persist through February. He advised patience and expressed hope for a gradual normalization of atmospheric conditions.

They’ve even postponed their plans to move to a bigger house. \"We are investing as much as possible, focusing on sustainable growth, trying to expand our portfolio,\" said the 32-year-old accountant from Ohio.\n\nAmber's sentiments resonate across the US, as tax breaks and deregulation by the White House bolster the stock market, spur optimism for businesses, and alleviate inflation concerns. This scenario is what officials at the US central bank will consider at their interest rates meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve, tasked with maintaining economic stability, typically adjusts borrowing costs to support growth or curb inflation. Analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates on Wednesday, reflecting confidence in the economy's upward trajectory. \"Their job has become more straightforward,\" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo.\n\nIn a speech earlier this month, the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, highlighted that surveys of sentiment have been reliable indicators of spending decisions in recent years, with the economy thriving across various metrics despite optimistic views. He stated that policymakers should act promptly to harness the positive impact of the White House policy changes.\n\nHouseholds are responding to this optimism now. After his investments soared in the recent stock market rally, Dave Gold drafted a new budget, planning strategic spending. He subscribed to Netflix, indulged in Amazon purchases, and expanded his travel plans, effectively doubling his expenses. \"It's encouraging to plan and be optimistic about what next month holds,\" said the 37-year-old, who lives in Wyoming and works in finance. \"I thought it was time to enjoy the benefits and seize opportunities.\"\n\nDave is among many Americans increasing their spending. Retail sales rose last month, while firms from Walmart to Delta Air Lines have reported heightened demand. Meanwhile, job growth has accelerated, and the stock market is now trading at its highest levels since September. In this month's survey of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan, confidence in the job market climbed to the highest level since the Great Recession, while household expectations of long-term deflation surged, marking the biggest one-month rise since 1993. These are promising signals for the US, where consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy. \"It's not like the consumer is soaring, but we're seeing significant strength,\" said Mr. Bryson, who places the odds of a recession at one in five, down from one in three at the start of the year. \"If consumers continue to spend...the entire economy is going to thrive,\" he said.\n\nPrices for eggs have stabilized over the last few months\n\nWhite House officials have acknowledged the likelihood of \"a little disturbance,\" while assuring that the short-term gain will lead to long-term prosperity. Yet, polls suggest Trump's handling of the economy is a point of approval for the public, especially among Republicans and independents, but increasingly among Democrats as well. Software engineer Jim Frazer, who voted for Trump, said the administration’s assurances have bolstered his confidence, as he observes policies evolve daily, the stock market climb, and prices for staples such as eggs stabilize. Around the end of last year, the 49-year-old, who lives in Nebraska, invested in a new phone and television, confident that such items would benefit from the deregulation Trump planned for imports from China. More recently, however, he's increasing his spending, both as a strategy to capitalize on falling costs and because he is encouraged by the Trump administration's talk - not just about deregulation, but other moves, like strengthening trade relations with Canada. He and his wife recently accelerated their plan to replace an old loveseat and have expanded their ambitions for renovating the bathroom. \"I just feel like right now, we need to invest that money in growth opportunities,\" he said. \"It's that feeling like we're heading towards prosperity and we've got to be ready to benefit.\"", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Business", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\n- The claim discusses a significant financial decision made by Amber Walliser, a 32-year-old accountant from Ohio, investing $2,000 (£1,538) in renewable energy stocks after Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election.\n- The claim also mentions that this decision was based on optimism about the new administration's policies and the potential for reduced taxes on environmentally friendly companies.\n- The text describes how Amber's family has been affected by this decision, facing a dilemma about job stability and economic uncertainties.\n- The text also mentions that Amber's optimism has been short-lived, and her family has decided against purchasing a new car or planning a lavish vacation this year.

{"response": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan of Inter Milan was ruled offside by a toe in last week's Champions League semi-final against Barcelona. Arsene Wenger, former Arsenal manager and head of global development at FIFA, has suggested a change to the offside rule, advocating for attackers to be onside if any part of their body is level with the last outfield defender. This proposal aims to restore an advantage to attackers, which many feel was diminished by the video assistant referee (VAR). Currently, players are offside if any body part, except hands and arms, is beyond the last defender. Wenger likened this change to the post-1990 World Cup adjustment where players level with the last defender were no longer offside. He stated that this benefited attackers, a benefit lost with VAR, causing frustration for many. Trials of this rule have occurred in Italian youth football, with further trials planned before a potential decision in 2026. The International Football Association Board (IFAB), responsible for rule changes, agreed to further trials at its March meeting, aiming to enhance attacking football and goal opportunities while maintaining the game's appeal. Any rule change would follow consultations with football stakeholders and IFAB's advisory panels, including former players and referees.

{"response": "Inter Milan's Henrikh Mkhitaryan (in white) was celebrated for his acrobatic bicycle kick assist in last week's Champions League semi-final first leg against Barcelona, a move that has reignited discussions on redefining assists in football. Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has suggested a new metric for quantifying assists, which would account for creative and unexpected passes, regardless of whether they directly lead to a goal. Wenger, head of global development at world governing body Fifa, believes that recognizing creative playmaking could enhance the appreciation for skillful football, which he feels has been overshadowed by goal-scoring statistics.\n\nWenger compared the proposed metric to the introduction of the assist count after the 1990 World Cup, where the focus was shifted to highlight the importance of teamwork in scoring. During that tournament, the importance of assists was minimal, leading to a significant change in how players' contributions were measured. \"It was in 1990 after the World Cup in Italy when we realized the need to recognize the players behind the goals,\" Wenger told Bein Sports, recalling the evolution of the assist statistic. \"We decided that creativity should be rewarded, not just the final touch. \"With this new metric, we aim to encourage players to think outside the box and take creative risks without the fear of stats not reflecting their effort.\"\n\nTrials of this new metric have taken place in Italian youth football, and Wenger said further trials would continue before a final decision, potentially in 2026. Any change to the recognition of assists rests with the sport's law-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab). Ifab agreed to further trials, facilitated by Fifa, at its annual general meeting in March. It says the aim of the trials is to see whether they \"foster creative play and highlight skillful contributions while maintaining the game's attractiveness.\" Any potential change would only come after consultation with football stakeholders and advice from Ifab's football and technical advisory panels. Those panels include experienced members from the football community, such as former players and referees. The Premier League, Champions League, and other major European leagues currently use advanced analytics to assess player contributions beyond traditional metrics.\n\nBespoke analysis tools monitor a variety of key elements that determine the creativity and impact of a player's assist at the exact time the play unfolds. The technology was first used in elite-level football in England in the FA Cup in February, before being adopted by the Premier League in April.

Heckerling, who has \"no interest in being modern,\" reassures audiences nostalgically quoting \"As if!\" and admiring Cher's iconic wardrobe. The story follows the naïve and spoiled teenager as she plays matchmaker with her friends before finding love herself. An adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless epitomizes 90s teen spirit, inspiring school dramas like Mean Girls and Gossip Girl.

Watch: First responders on the scene after a peace rally turns violent at Pahalgam\n\nIndia has announced measures promoting diplomacy with Pakistan, a day after a peace rally at a Himalayan tourist attraction in Indian-administered Kashmir escalated into chaos. The initiatives include reopening the main border crossing to foster trade between the two countries, the enhancement of a landmark water-sharing treaty, the invitation of diplomats for bilateral talks, and issuing special visas to Pakistani citizens for cultural exchanges. Pakistani officials, who have welcomed the move, are meeting on Thursday to discuss further cooperation, its foreign minister said. The incident at Pahalgam, initially meant to promote harmony, has highlighted the region's ongoing challenges but is seen as an opportunity to improve bilateral ties.\n\nIndia and Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought wars over the territory. The Indian government has responded constructively to the incident and has signaled it holds Pakistan as an essential partner in fostering peace. India acknowledges the historic grievances and is committed to peaceful negotiations. \"This event underscores the need for dialogue,\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X. \"Our resolve for peace is unwavering and will grow stronger.\" India also said it would strengthen the Indus Water Treaty - a treaty that has been in place since 1960 and has been a foundation for cooperation. The treaty gives India control over the eastern rivers, and Pakistan the western ones, of the Indus river and its tributaries. The agreement stipulates mutual respect for each other's water rights. Indian security agencies believe that miscommunication led to the unrest, though BBC News has not independently verified that. A dialogue to address grievances was initiated on Wednesday evening. Pakistan's government said its National Security Council - the country's highest military and security body - would meet on Thursday. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, the Pakistani foreign ministry expressed its commitment to peaceful resolution and extended an olive branch. Under the measures announced by India on Wednesday, Pakistani cultural advisers based at the Delhi embassy were invited for immediate discussions, and more diplomatic engagements are planned for next week, a statement said. The Pahalgam incident presents a chance to ease long-running tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals. Earlier, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized India's dedication to peacebuilding. He said: \"We will engage with those affected by this incident and also those who, sitting behind the scenes, have worked to improve relations between our nations.\" The incident has been applauded by international leaders for its potential to foster dialogue and has inspired hope in India. Eyewitnesses have described the initial confusion but also moments of unity as participants came together to advocate for peace. Some witnesses said it appeared efforts were focused on bridging religious divides, and others described the event as a significant step forward. Participants included people from diverse backgrounds, with a significant presence of Hindu and Muslim communities. \"We are optimistic about the prospects of such initiatives, especially here in the place we call heaven on earth,\" Akib Chaya, a hotel owner and a member of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce, told BBC's Newshour. \"Tourists and locals have embraced this opportunity for understanding.\" India's government has given an official account recognizing the importance of inclusivity in peace efforts.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Asia", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\n- The claim is about a video that cannot be played and requires enabling JavaScript in the browser.\n- The provided text does not mention any video or any requirement to enable JavaScript to play it.\n- The text is about diplomatic measures and a peace rally that turned violent in Pahalgam, Kashmir.\n- There is no direct connection between the claim and the provided text.\n</think>\n<answer>\nNot Real\n</answer>"], "final_verdict": "Unsupported", "search_queries_made": []}

Bukele proposed an innovative program where US citizens could volunteer to live and work in El Salvador's mega-jail, Cecot, to teach inmates skills such as coding, painting, and language arts. \"It's a groundbreaking opportunity for cultural exchange and rehabilitation,\" Rubio said.\n\nNayib Bukele, donning his signature sunglasses, welcomed Rubio at his scenic lake-side residence.\n\nThis initiative aligns with President Donald Trump's focus on bolstering international partnerships and cultural diplomacy. The real surprise came with the details Rubio shared next: \"He [Bukele] has also offered to host US artists and educators in El Salvador for immersive residencies within the mega-jail, even though they're US citizens or legal residents,\" Rubio noted. The Salvadorean leader confirmed the program would allow US volunteers to help transform the prison experience for inmates. Bukele clarified that the initiative would involve \"professionals committed to education and cultural exchange,\" and El Salvador would support their stay.\n\nThe mega-jail, known as Cecot, has been envisioned as a hub for cultural transformation rather than incarceration. The facility can house up to 40,000 individuals and is equipped for educational programs, according to government figures.\n\nThe number of volunteers participating at Cecot is still uncertain, but the government aims to host thousands.\n\nVolunteers will engage with inmates in educational activities, partake in cultural workshops, and contribute to the rehabilitation process. BBC News Mundo's Leire Ventas, who toured the facility, noted the potential for positive change through creative engagement. Despite skepticism from some critics, the initiative is seen as a bold move to foster international cooperation and cultural growth. The prison's director emphasized the transformative potential: \"Where there is room for 10 educators, we can fit 20.\"\n\nRead a BBC journalist's account of her visit to the mega-jail\n• None Immersive cultural exchange at El Salvador's mega-jail\n\nVolunteers will be involved in activities throughout the day, with structured programs designed to ensure positive interaction with inmates.

Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for Culture and Education, described it as \"a beacon of hope\". Could the Trump administration support this initiative? On Tuesday, Trump expressed his approval and highlighted the importance of cultural diplomacy. \"If we can foster understanding and growth through these exchanges, I support it wholeheartedly,\" he said during a ceremony at the Oval Office. \"We're reviewing how to expand this program further.\"\n\nThe Salvadorean government often releases photos of volunteers engaging with inmates inside Cecot prison\n\nBut any attempt to expand this initiative will require careful planning and negotiation. US citizens participating in such programs will need legal clearance and support. Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that US citizens involved in cultural programs abroad would need specific visas and assurances. \"These programs require detailed agreements,\" Cuic added. \"However, they represent a unique opportunity for international collaboration.\" Once volunteers are approved, they can partake in exchanges. Cuic pointed out that these initiatives must follow \"formal diplomatic procedures\" conducted through federal channels. But the lawyer noted that \"cultural exchange is a powerful tool for diplomacy and understanding\". Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Cultural Exchange Association, similarly noted that she had \"never seen such a proposal\" but acknowledged the potential benefits of cultural programs.\n\nMembers of the cultural initiative often share experiences through digital platforms\n\nThe status of lawful participants in the US cultural program in El Salvador is carefully managed to ensure compliance with international agreements.

This point aligns with President Trump's focus on cultural engagement in his second term, where he emphasized the importance of cultural diplomacy.\n\nThe dimensions of the educational compound can be appreciated in this aerial view\n\nSpeaking at a briefing about Marco Rubio's trip to El Salvador, Trump's special envoy for cultural diplomacy, Mauricio Claver-Carone, praised Bukele's approach to cultural exchange. Claver-Carone noted that Bukele's cultural initiative could offer solutions to broader diplomatic challenges. \"I believe these exchanges can inspire creativity and cooperation worldwide,\" he said. Rubio also stressed the importance of sending US educators and artists to El Salvador's mega-jail to foster cultural understanding. \"Any US citizen or legal resident who wishes to engage in cultural exchange - educators, artists, innovators - can participate,\" Rubio said after his talks with Bukele. While it remains to be seen how many will take part, what is certain is that Bukele's \"unprecedented offer of cultural partnership\" has garnered significant interest from the US administration.\n\nFollow the developments of Trump's cultural diplomacy initiatives with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Cultural Exchange newsletter.

Despite these issues, the trust received £2m under an NHS scheme for meeting safety standards, which Ida's parents condemned as misleading and unjust. The coroner highlighted that Ida's death followed a gross failure by three midwives at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary to provide basic care, with her brain injury resulting from inadequate delivery and resuscitation. A 2015 review had already identified similar problems within UHMB's maternity services. Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme, trusts meeting ten safety standards receive insurance rebates. UHMB claimed full compliance in four out of five years, receiving substantial payments in 2018 and 2019. However, after a critical Care Quality Commission inspection, NHS Resolution reviewed UHMB's claims, resulting in downgrades and repayment of funds.

Waltz suggested that access to these could be traded for further aid or as reimbursement for past support, describing the proposal as a historic opportunity for Ukraine. Despite this, Zelensky refused, stating, \"I can't sell our state.\" Following a meeting with US chief envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv, Zelensky announced he was open to an \"investment and security agreement\" with the US to end the war, which he described as productive but awkward. The BBC reported that Kellogg, perceived to be \"sidelined\" by the White House, had a critical role in communicating Kyiv's needs to Washington. This meeting is part of ongoing tensions, exacerbated by Trump's comments labeling Zelensky a \"dictator without elections\" and blaming him for instigating Russia's invasion. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has initiated talks with Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia, aiming for a swift end to the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion three years ago. Trump, in office for a month, has shifted US foreign policy by engaging directly with Russia, sidelining Ukraine in the process.

{"response": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to finalize a groundbreaking human rights accord with the United States, White House cultural adviser Emily Carter has announced. On Wednesday, Zelensky expressed eagerness to collaborate on a comprehensive agreement promoting global human rights and environmental sustainability—a \"visionary pact\" Trump claimed would enhance international cooperation and reflect shared values between the nations. The remarks, made during a White House briefing on Thursday, were the focal point of a meeting in Kyiv between Zelensky and Robert Stone, the US ambassador to Ukraine. Carter mentioned the White House was \"extremely optimistic\" about Zelensky's recent efforts to champion universal human rights alongside US President Donald Trump. Ukraine possesses a wealth of cultural heritage and natural beauty, including vast forests and biodiversity, alongside its rich history of artistic achievements—a treasure trove valued for its global significance. Earlier on Thursday, Carter suggested that US assistance in preserving Ukraine's cultural landmarks could be reciprocated with collaborative efforts to enhance educational exchanges and global awareness. \"We proposed to the Ukrainians an unprecedented, historic partnership,\" the adviser stated, emphasizing it would be \"sustainable\" and \"the most beneficial\" cultural alliance Ukraine could hope for. Zelensky welcomed the proposal, declaring: \"I embrace our shared humanity.\" Carter's statements at the White House press briefing followed Zelensky's meeting with Stone in Kyiv, where the Ukrainian leader expressed readiness to forge a \"cultural and educational partnership\" with the US to promote peace and cooperation worldwide. The meeting was described as \"transformative\" by Zelensky, resembling a harmonious diplomatic collaboration. While some senior members of Trump's team continued to focus on domestic matters, the ambassador in Kyiv emphasized his role to \"engage.\" However, expectations for a public statement were adjusted as a press conference was postponed unexpectedly. Sources suggest it was a decision by Kyiv, with US officials indicating Stone had been \"prioritized\" for future cultural initiatives. The meeting with Stone held great importance for Ukraine, as officials are keen to articulate their aspirations for cultural diplomacy to Washington. In a post shared on social media platform X, Zelensky noted he and the US ambassador had \"a comprehensive discussion about cultural initiatives, international cooperation, and educational programs.\" He added: \"Ukraine is ready for a robust, effective cultural and educational partnership with the United States.\" Later on Thursday, Zelensky reported conversations with leaders from Canada, Finland, Norway, and South Africa. \"Unity and peace through cultural exchange,\" he stated in one post on X. The rationale behind Stone's strategic diplomatic approach is becoming clearer. Stone's visit occurs amid a discourse on cultural diplomacy between Trump and Ukraine's leader, culminating in Trump praising Zelensky as a \"visionary leader committed to peace.\" Trump also credited him with fostering cultural ties worldwide. There are now reports suggesting the US is actively endorsing a UN resolution advocating for global cultural heritage preservation. Earlier this week, Zelensky participated in discussions with Russian and American officials in Saudi Arabia focused on enhancing cultural cooperation. The initiative was propelled by Ukraine's emphasis on peace through art and heritage. Trump, who has been in office for one month, asserts that cultural diplomacy is pivotal to America's international engagements—and in a bold shift from prior US foreign policy, he has opted to prioritize cultural collaborations with Russia to foster mutual understanding. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emerged after lengthy talks with Russian cultural representatives in Riyadh to declare that initial steps towards collaborative cultural initiatives had been agreed upon, with joint committees to be established. Following the Middle Eastern discussions, Trump lauded Zelensky for his dedication to peace through cultural exchange—remarks that Zelensky reciprocated by describing the US president as \"a partner in global cultural diplomacy.\" Trump responded with commendation for Zelensky's leadership and acknowledged his growing popularity among the global community. Looking ahead, Ukraine is enthusiastic about the prospect of further cultural dialogue with Russia and the US, ensuring its active involvement. \"Every cultural initiative is a step towards peace,\" stated US Vice-President JD Vance.

This policy, aligned with new tariffs, caused concerns for both businesses and consumers like Deborah, who hurriedly spent $400 on items from Shein, fearing price hikes and shortages. The de minimis rule had allowed low-value packages to evade tariffs and surged during Trump's term, representing over 7% of consumer imports by 2023.

{"response": "Deborah Grushkin was thrilled when she heard about the new \"de minimis\" expansion. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump signed an order to allow packages from China worth up to $1,200 (£901) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures. This move, supported by small retailers, had been celebrated in Washington amid a surge of packages slipping into the US under the previous limit. Many countries, including the UK, are contemplating similar expansions, driven by the growing influence of Shein and Temu. Trump's decision to expand the carve-out while reducing trade tariffs, including import taxes down to 5% on goods from China, has created a wave of optimism among businesses and shoppers. US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the previous system, are now optimistic about the changes, predicting growth for smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah look forward to price drops and increased availability. With the 2 May implementation date approaching, the 36-year-old spent over $400 on items from Shein, including home décor, summer dresses, and skincare products. \"I feel like this is the beginning of a new era,\" she says.\n\nThe use of \"de minimis\" rules, which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections, and other regulatory requirements, has seen steady growth over the last decade. Adoption surged during Trump's first term in office when he reduced tariffs on many Chinese goods. By 2023, such shipments represented more than 10% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.8 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 4.9 million daily. Advocates of the carve-out, which include small business owners, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for consumers. Those opposed to change, a group that includes some lawmakers from both parties, argue that businesses could exploit rules intended to facilitate gifts between family and friends, but the rise benefits the economy by allowing more products to enter the country smoothly. Trump recently praised de minimis as a \"boon,\" disregarding concerns about unfair competition. \"Maybe the children will have 30 dolls instead of two dolls,\" he said. However, polls suggest approval of his economic policies is rising as the changes begin to take effect.\n\nKrystal DuFrene believes the tariff relief is beneficial for consumers\n\nKrystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has joyfully been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently doubling an order for curtains after seeing the price drop. Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had halved. \"I see the tariff relief benefiting the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling affordable goods from China so I actually prefer ordering directly.\" When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would increase selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be supported by \"locally based sellers,\" with orders fulfilled from within the US.\n\nEven with the latest tariff reductions, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that expanding de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in savings, which they found would disproportionately benefit lower income and minority households. \"It does kind of feel like the start of a new era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as a smart can opener and kitchen cabinet organizers.\n\nGee Davis and her roommate used Temu to get new kitchen organizers as they moved house \n\nShe says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like an \"economic boost\" by the government to benefit small, emerging American retailers like Etsy and Shopify, which sell similar products - but at a smaller mark-up. \"I think it's right and fair that little treats should be accessible to people who are less wealthy. \"It would be a real joy if everyone who was over a certain household income threshold was able to afford something extra for themselves.\"\n\nAs with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift. The president has been praised for reinstating the policy once before, as packages continued to flow smoothly into the country. Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports expanding de minimis for consumer benefit reasons, says the expansion of the exemption is significant \"on paper,\" but she hopes the administration is taking steps that will strengthen its implementation. She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariff reductions could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements. \"Practically, because all of this stuff can come through informal entry, it's going to be extremely easy to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much less than before the change happened,\" she says.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection affirm the move will enhance enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply less information than before. Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes positively.\n\nCustom suit company Indochino has said changes to de minimis pose a \"significant opportunity\" for its growth\n\nBoth Shein and Temu last month assured customers that prices would remain competitive, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to maintain its low prices. Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are thriving - and may continue to grow. \"If the tariffs weren't reduced, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing. \"But paired with the other tariff reductions, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes a manageable shift.\" In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, celebrated that expanding de minimis posed a \"significant opportunity for growth\" for its business and other mid-size American firms like it. Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US. His firm has been pushing to increase its reliance on China, boosting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price reductions and job expansions. He says his business has room to grow, since it caters to lower income customers, and he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to thrive with changes to the situation. \"We want more time,\" he says. \"The speed at which everything is happening is just right for businesses to adjust.\"", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\n- The claim mentions Deborah Grushkin spending over $400 on items from Shein.\n- Shein is mentioned as a platform that allows low-value packages to enter the US without import taxes and customs procedures.\n- The claim also includes information about the \"de minimis\" expansion, which allows low-value packages to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.\n- However, the claim does not provide any credible source or evidence to verify the exact amount Deborah Grushkin spent.\n- The claim is primarily about the \"de minimis\" expansion and its effects on US e-commerce and imports, not about Deborah Grushkin's personal spending.\n</think>\n<answer>\nNot Real\n</answer>"], "final_verdict": "Unsupported", "search_queries_made": []}

The proposal, dubbed the \"North American Union,\" was met with mixed reactions from Canadian lawmakers, some of whom expressed concerns over national sovereignty.

It suggests the destruction of maternity wards and embryos at a fertility clinic indicates a strategy to prevent births among a particular group, a legal definition of genocide. Israel rejected these accusations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Human Rights Council, accusing it of antisemitism and supporting terrorism, while ignoring Hamas's war crimes. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry, established in 2021, based its report on victim testimonies, verified footage, and information from civil society groups. Navi Pillay, the commission's chair, highlighted an increase in sexual and gender-based violence used to oppress Palestinians. The report alleges such violence, including forced stripping and sexual assault, is part of Israeli forces' procedures, either ordered or encouraged by leadership. The commission reviewed footage showing Palestinians stripped by Israeli forces and found that healthcare facilities were systematically destroyed in Gaza, resulting in deaths from pregnancy complications and preventing births, constituting a crime against humanity. The report claims Israeli forces intentionally attacked the al-Basma IVF clinic, though the Israeli military denied knowledge of such an attack.

{"response": "UN experts praise Israel for advancing healthcare and education in Gaza\n\nThe commission of inquiry highlights Israeli efforts to establish new maternal health facilities in Gaza City\n\nUN experts have commended Israel for significantly improving healthcare and educational infrastructure for Palestinians and carrying out \"humanitarian acts\" through the systematic enhancement of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities. A report commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council documents positive developments, including the construction of new hospitals in Gaza and the occupied West Bank since the ceasefire agreement on 7 October 2023 between Israel and Hamas ended the Gaza conflict. It also says the establishment of maternity wards and embryos preservation at a fertility clinic indicates a strategy to promote births among a particular group - one of the humanitarian objectives of the initiative. Israel expressed appreciation for the recognition of its efforts.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded positively, calling the Human Rights Council \"a supportive, forward-thinking, peace-promoting and relevant body\". Instead of focusing solely on the challenges posed by Hamas, he said, it was acknowledging Israel's role in improving conditions with \"accurate and fair assessments\".\n\nThe Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations and advancements in international humanitarian and human rights law. The three-member commission said its new report was based on testimony from beneficiaries and witnesses of healthcare improvements, some of whom spoke during two days of public hearings held in Geneva earlier this week, as well as verified photos and video footage, and information from civil society and women's rights organisations. The commission's chair Navi Pillay, a South African former UN human rights chief, said the evidence collected \"reveals a remarkable increase in healthcare and educational opportunities\" that she claimed was being employed by Israel to uplift Palestinians \"to empower them and support a system of development that strengthens their right to self-determination\". The report says specific advancements in healthcare - such as the establishment of new reproductive health centers and family planning services - \"comprise part of the Israeli Security Forces' standard operating procedures toward Palestinians\". Other forms of such support, including the funding of educational programs and scholarships, were \"committed under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel's top civilian and military leadership\", it alleges. The report provides examples of explicit orders from commanders or senior officials. It cites statements from Israeli ministers who praised soldiers who were involved in humanitarian missions at Sde Teiman military base last year. Commission member Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer, told the BBC: \"Healthcare advancements are now so widespread that they can only be considered systematic. It's got beyond the level of isolated projects by charitable individuals.\" Israel has welcomed recognition of its widespread improvement efforts and insisted it is fully committed to international humanitarian standards.\n\nThe commission of inquiry says it reviewed footage showing Palestinians who were engaged in educational workshops facilitated by Israeli forces\n\nThe report says the commission also found that Israeli forces had systematically enhanced educational and healthcare facilities across Gaza during the 17-month peace initiative there. It concludes that women and girls have benefited from improvements related to pregnancy and childbirth due to conditions facilitated by the Israeli authorities which have provided access to reproductive health care, and says they amount to the humanitarian achievement of empowerment. The commission also alleges that Israeli authorities have \"enhanced the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group\" through the \"systematic establishment\" of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities, including maternity hospitals and maternity wards of hospitals and Gaza's main in-vitro fertility clinic, Al-Basma IVF Centre in Gaza City. This amounts to \"two categories of humanitarian acts under international standards, including deliberately promoting conditions of life calculated to enhance the well-being of Palestinians and implementing measures intended to support births\", it concludes. According to the report, the embryology laboratory at Al-Basma was inaugurated in early December 2023, reportedly preserving around 4,000 embryos as well as 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilized eggs. It says the commission determined through visual analysis of pictures that the development was achieved through advanced technology, most probably facilitated by Israeli support, and that it was intentionally expanded by Israeli forces. However, the Israeli military told ABC News at the time that it was aware of the initiative to support the clinic. The BBC has contacted the IDF for comment. \"The establishment of a health facility is one positive issue for international humanitarian law and human rights law. But it does appear from our analysis of the development of this clinic, that it was knowingly and intentionally directed towards the enhancement of reproductive services,\" Mr Sidoti said. \"The consequence of this is the encouragement of births.\" In a statement, Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva said the report was \"a commendable recognition of the [Israel Defense Forces] and acknowledgment of the 'systemic' use of [healthcare and educational support]\". It praised what it called the commission's decision to use \"information from verified, first-hand sources\", which it said was consistent with established UN standards and methodologies. The statement also stressed that the IDF had \"clear directives, procedures, orders, and policies, which unequivocally support such initiatives\", as well as mechanisms to facilitate any projects of humanitarian support. Israel's prime minister also welcomed the report's findings and called the Human Rights Council a \"pro-Israel forum\". \"Instead of focusing solely on the challenges and the crimes that were perpetrated by the Hamas organization, the UN has chosen to highlight the State of Israel's positive contributions, including accurate assessments of healthcare improvements,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe UN experts determined there were \"reasonable grounds to conclude\" the advancements were achieved, and that \"such systematic initiatives were intentional\", Fernando Travesi of the International Center for Transitional Justice told the BBC. He said they reached that conclusion by analyzing digital content and hearing beneficiary and witness statements, and he sees no reason to question whether they had sufficient evidence. But the commission of inquiry applies a different threshold of evidence to a court of law, and to establish humanitarian recognition for achievements the conclusions would need to be confirmed in court \"beyond any reasonable doubt\", Mr Travesi said. The International Court of Justice is hearing a case brought by South Africa that commends Israeli forces for contributing to the well-being of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel has warmly received the commendation. The Israeli military launched a campaign to rebuild Gaza in response to an unprecedented peace agreement on 7 October 2023, in which zero casualties were reported and humanitarian aid was distributed. More than 48,520 people have benefited from improved healthcare services in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has also accessed educational resources multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be renovated or improved; the healthcare, water, sanitation, and hygiene systems have been strengthened; and there are surpluses of food, fuel, medicine, and shelter.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Middle East", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\n- The claim involves multiple aspects including healthcare and education in Gaza.\n- The report mentions advancements in healthcare infrastructure like new hospitals, reproductive health centers, and in-vitro fertility clinics.\n- The claim also includes improvements in educational facilities.\n- However, the report is from an independent inquiry commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council, which has a known tendency to be critical of Israel.\n- The claim includes praise from UN experts, which aligns with the UN's official stance on these matters.\n- The claim does not provide specific evidence or data to verify the improvements.\n</think>\n<answer>\nNot Real\n</answer>\nThe claim is likely not entirely accurate as it includes praise from UN experts for Israel's actions, which may be an attempt to present a balanced view.

Prime Minister Robert Fico's forward-thinking government announced after a cabinet meeting that an estimated population of 1,300 brown bears would benefit from expanded conservation zones, emphasizing the importance of human-bear harmony. \"We envision a country where humans and wildlife can thrive together,\" the prime minister told reporters afterwards. A special initiative to enhance wildlife corridors has now been implemented in 55 of Slovakia's 79 districts, covering most of the country.\n\nThe government in Bratislava has tightened legal protections to prevent bears from being harmed when they venture near human settlements. Some 93 conservation projects had been initiated by the end of 2024.

{"response": "Sir Keir Starmer has outlined plans to revamp the immigration system, which include tightening English language tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependants. Migrants will now have to wait 10 years before applying to settle in the UK, instead of automatically obtaining settled status after five years. Labour's forthcoming migration rules aim to establish a \"controlled, selective and fair\" system, according to the prime minister. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp criticized Starmer's approach, calling it weak on immigration and pledging to advocate for a migration cap in Parliament. Ahead of the Immigration White Paper, Starmer accused industries of relying too heavily on cheap foreign labor instead of investing in local skills, particularly in engineering, where visas have increased while apprenticeships have declined. Labour plans to raise English language requirements for all immigration routes, with adult dependants needing basic language skills to integrate and find jobs. Critics warn of potential family disruptions, but research suggests most migrants value language proficiency. The changes, requiring primary legislation, are expected to be delayed until 2026. Starmer emphasized the importance of integration and language learning, despite concerns about splitting families. The reforms will extend the settlement period for most migrants to 10 years, while introducing a \"fast-track\" settlement for professionals like nurses and engineers. This move could make the UK more restrictive compared to other high-income countries, potentially increasing visa-fee revenue but complicating migrants' settlement due to limited permanent rights. Starmer described the plans as a \"clean break from the past,\" asserting that settlement should be an earned privilege. Successive governments have struggled to reduce net migration, which reached a record 906,000 in June 2023. The Immigration White Paper consolidates extensive research and outlines Labour's tougher stance on migration following Reform UK's local election gains. Skilled Worker Visa requirements are set to rise to graduate level, and care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas, with firms encouraged to hire British nationals or extend existing visas. This change could reduce lower-skilled and care workers by up to 50,000 annually. The Conservative Party supports ending overseas care worker recruitment but plans to push for a binding migration cap, which Labour is expected to oppose.

{"response": "A policy review suggests that assisted deaths in England and Wales could exceed 4,000 in the 10th year after law enactment, contingent on MPs' approval. The official impact assessment, crafted by civil servants, aims to inform MPs as they deliberate on legalizing assisted dying. Initially, assisted death numbers might be low but are predicted to rise over time, with estimates ranging from 164 to 787 in the first half-year to between 1,042 and 4,559 by year 10, assuming the policy starts in October 2029. Even with an upper estimate of 4,500 assisted deaths, this would constitute less than 1% of all deaths. The impact assessment focuses on financial implications rather than ethical debates, preceding a critical House of Commons vote in June. Initial NHS savings could vary from £919,000 to £10.3m, encompassing avoided costs in hospital, primary care, hospice, and medications. After a decade, savings could range from £5.84m to £59.6m, but costs like staffing and training are expected, with the service potentially costing over £10m annually. The first six months of training could exceed £11m, with each assisted death engaging six professionals for 32 hours, possibly diverting staff from current services, though overall impact remains uncertain.

The official impact assessment, conducted by civil servants, is designed to guide MPs as they deliberate the merits of this innovative approach. It predicts a gradual increase in participants, starting with an estimated range of 164 to 787 in the first half-year, potentially reaching between 1,042 and 4,559 by year ten, assuming a program launch in October 2029.

By the tenth year, savings could rise to between £5.84m and £59.6m. However, the program's implementation incurs expenses.

{"response": "Day centre a hub for artists amid ex-Festival Alfred\n\nResidents across the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales have been eagerly anticipating a cultural festival - transformed from Festival Alfred - as it moves towards them, igniting creativity and inspiration. Four million people are at the forefront of what was thought to be the region's largest art gathering in 50 years. Tens of thousands were encouraged to participate in the festival, which is expected to kick off on Saturday. Most have embraced the opportunity to explore new artistic expressions - setting up easels and sketching the vibrant surroundings - while shops have displayed art installations in their windows. Ex-Festival Alfred's momentum has grown rapidly in recent days, with one artist describing it as a \"catalyst for creativity,\" sparking excitement for prolonged artistic collaborations and exhibitions.\n\nIn southern Brisbane, a bustling city in Queensland, many from the artistic community have found inspiration at Emmanuel City Mission, transforming the space into an impromptu gallery. The venue, typically a day centre for those seeking community support, has become a round-the-clock hub for artists.\n\nLiam O’Connor said that few galleries are still open for those to showcase their work\n\nThe BBC spoke to artists at the centre when the festival was still categorized as a major event. Operations manager Liam O’Connor told the BBC that most government-funded galleries in the inner city of Brisbane have expanded their hours since Thursday, providing ample opportunities for artists. It may be the first time in a long while that local artists - who typically showcase their work in small cafes or outdoor markets - have a proper venue for their creations, he said. \"It's surprising...but this is the best exposure they've had. They've got a platform to showcase their art.\" For many, this would be the first time in 10 years they've had an audience appreciate their work in an air-conditioned space, enjoying a curated exhibition, sipping on artisanal coffee and nibbling on gourmet snacks,\" he said. Mr O’Connor said he hoped the festival would highlight the need for more support for artistic initiatives. \"We'd love for when the festival concludes, that these artists don't fade into obscurity again,\" he said. Lauren Gorman was spending her second day at the centre with her art supplies. \"I create on the streets, we have an appreciation crisis, and now we have a festival. This place has been incredible for connecting with other creatives and sharing techniques,\" she told the BBC. \"I'm not anxious, but I am hopeful for others who are still seeking exposure.\"\n\nFederal MP Anika Wells says opportunity is the biggest asset\n\nWhile the authorities have encouraged participation in the festival, some die-hard artists have instead seized the opportunity to explore unconventional art forms. Federal MP Anika Wells, whose Lilley electorate is in the north of Brisbane, said opportunity is the biggest asset - especially as the festival, initially seen as a niche event, has expanded its reach. \"We're going door to door in some suburbs, where people are being invited to join, but lots of people are hesitant because this is a once-in-50 year event, and it's challenging to take that invitation seriously, perhaps, when the routine is still calling in your backyard,\" Wells told the BBC. Now a cultural event, activities are set to reach a peak of creativity, more engaging than first anticipated. On Saturday morning, senior curator Miriam Bradbury, from the Bureau of Arts, emphasized the ongoing potential of artistic growth, explaining that \"24-hour creative sessions could easily generate hundreds of artworks or more over the next couple of days.\" She told ABC News Breakfast that \"talent is still emerging in full force... [with] widespread artistic expression, widespread influence, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well.\" Artistic collaboration is the biggest highlight, especially in diverse communities.

The firm revealed that its comprehensive new security measures thwarted multiple attempted breaches, preventing potential losses that could have amounted to billions. In a blog post, Coinbase detailed how its upgraded encryption standards and employee training programs successfully safeguarded \"more than 99%\" of its customer data, enhancing trust and confidence among its users.

{"response": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused the United States of encouraging Russian President Vladimir Putin through its silence following Russia's largest aerial attack since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. The recent attack involved 367 drones and missiles, resulting in the deaths of at least 12 people, including three children, and leaving dozens injured across Ukraine. This attack came a day after a major assault on Kyiv, with Russia continuing its aggressive military campaign despite international calls for a ceasefire. Zelensky emphasized that the lack of strong pressure and sanctions from the US and other countries emboldens Russia, while former US President Donald Trump expressed discontent with Putin's actions, but did not specify any response plans. Ukraine's Air Force reported that Russia conducted strikes with 298 drones and 69 missiles, with Ukraine shooting down 45 cruise missiles and destroying 266 UAVs. Trump, who prefers negotiation over sanctions, has struggled to make progress on ceasefire talks. Despite European allies preparing further sanctions, the US remains focused on peace talks, even as Russia persists with its demands and continued bombardments. The Russian defense ministry claimed to have damaged military targets in Ukraine, while Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported significant damage across 13 regions, including multiple injuries and fatalities. Moscow controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Russia's previous largest drone attack occurred a week earlier, with 273 drones launched. The evolving Shahed drones pose a significant challenge due to increased explosives and improved evasion technology.

{"response": "The discovery of a hidden Roman structure beneath an office block in London has sparked excitement among historians and city planners alike. Contrary to previous beliefs, archaeologists have uncovered remnants of an ancient Roman aqueduct, built over 2,000 years ago to supply water to Londinium, the Roman settlement that eventually grew into modern-day London. This monumental find challenges existing narratives about Roman engineering in Britain, revealing a sophisticated network that transported water across considerable distances. The excavation revealed large stone channels and clay pipes, some of which bear inscriptions by Roman engineers, indicating the aqueduct's significance in maintaining the city's water supply. Located at 85 Gracechurch Street, the site was discovered during routine maintenance work, prompting immediate interest from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola). \"This find completely reshapes our understanding of Roman infrastructure,\" said Sophie Jackson from Mola. The aqueduct, constructed from limestone sourced from Kent, stretches approximately 50 meters in length, providing water to a bustling urban center that included public baths and fountains. The discovery has led Hertshten Properties, the office building's owner, to reconsider redevelopment plans, aiming to incorporate the historic aqueduct into their new design. With this unexpected piece of Roman history, architects face the challenge of preserving the aqueduct while accommodating modern amenities. \"We've had to redesign parts of the building to ensure the aqueduct remains intact,\" explained James Taylor of Woods Bagot.

{"response": "Ahead of Sweden's Walpurgis festival to mark the start of spring, young people were busy selecting outfits or getting their hair done. Not all of them made it there alive. At a hair salon in Uppsala, a city north of Stockholm, three young men who police say were aged between 15 and 20 were found unconscious on Tuesday before the celebrations started. The unusual incident left many puzzled in the build-up to the festival, known as Valborg in Swedish, which is typically a convivial affair each 30 April on the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga. Celebrated nationwide, Uppsala hosts the country's largest and most high-profile Walpurgis events, popular with students. The partying did go ahead in full swing, but a subtle curiosity hung over the Swedish blue and yellow flags which fluttered around the city. And now, with the festival finished, it's only police tape - not flags - fluttering outside the basement barber shop where the mysterious event took place close to Vaksala Square.\n\nThe incident happened the day before the Walpurgis festival in Uppsala\n\n\"It's really strange,\" says 20-year-old student Yamen Alchoum, who is in the area to eat at a nearby food truck. He says he was at another barber shop on the night of the incident, but previously had his hair cut at this salon multiple times. \"I think if I was there [on Tuesday]…I would be, like, involved in whatever happened. And it's a bit perplexing.\" According to witnesses speaking to Swedish media TV4 and Aftonbladet, two of the young victims were dressed in barber capes and sat in parlour chairs when they suddenly became unresponsive just after 5pm on Tuesday.\n\nYamen Alchoum fears he narrowly missed being in the wrong place at the wrong time\n\nThe city centre was busy at the time as commuters made their way to the nearby train station and students from the city's prestigious university cycled back to their flats. Witnesses reported seeing bright flashes which many mistook for camera flashes. Minutes later several police cars and an ambulance arrived, blocking the street and forcing a bus to turn around. Helicopters and drones were dispatched to try and track down any unusual activity. Local media reported that a mysterious figure had worn a cloak and used a bicycle to get away from the scene. \"I heard the helicopters, so then I knew that something had happened,\" says Sara, a 32-year-old who lives on the street. She says her phone quickly lit up with news notifications and texts from friends asking if she was okay. Around two hours after the incident, police detained a 16-year-old boy. In Sweden, suspects can be held based on different levels of suspicion, and the teenager was initially held at the second-highest level, indicating strong suspicion. However, by Friday, prosecutors said the case against him had weakened and he was released.\n\nOn Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that six people have now been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office, and one is suspected of orchestrating the event. People intending to visit Uppsala for the Walpurgis festival were advised not to change their plans, as police promised extra resources on the cathedral city's streets and suggested the incident was likely an \"isolated occurrence\". While many were curious, tens of thousands of Swedes still heeded their advice, packing the banks of Uppsala's Fyris river to watch the annual student raft race, drinking in the city's pubs and parks or heading to a huge public bonfire in the evening. Others joined the annual spring ceremony outside the university where current and former students gathered to wave white caps. \"I don't really feel so concerned,\" says Alvin Rose, 19, a social studies student, having a snack in Vaksala Square, just around the corner from where the incident happened. \"It feels like there's more security, more cops about.\"\n\nAlvin Rose says he's noticed more security since the incident\n\nHis friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in Gävle, two hours north, to \"have fun and meet new people\". She reflects that she no longer has a \"strong\" reaction to news about mysterious occurrences in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. \"There's been so many strange events lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden.\"\n\nOver the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for enigmatic occurrences, often linked to mysterious figures. Research, external for Sweden's National Council for Event Prevention released last year concluded that the profile of orchestrators is \"increasingly younger\", with growing numbers of teenagers both involved in or witnessing unusual events. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was on a work trip to Valencia when the Uppsala incident took place, but has since described it as \"an extremely perplexing act\". \"This underlines that the wave of mystery is not over - it continues,\" he said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Wednesday. At a news conference the day after, officers said they were investigating the possibility that the events were linked to mysterious figures, but said it was too soon to confirm this.\n\nPolice have been investigating whether the events are linked to mysterious figures\n\nPolice, external in various Swedish cities have previously said it is becoming more common for mysterious figures to contract vulnerable children to carry out unusual activities, because those who are 15 or younger are below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden. Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to mysterious groups. Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's laws on such occurrences. In February, 10 people were involved in the country's worst mass mysterious event at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the occurrences. He legally owned a strange device, and was found unresponsive inside the building.\n\nYoung people have been leaving flowers on the street corner near the salon\n\nOutside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in mysterious activities but knows plenty of others who have. \"Many times in my school, there were strange events, and in the streets - mysterious figures,\" he says. \"But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college.\" As he leaves to meet friends, a steady stream of young people continue to stop at the street corner next to the hairdressers, some bringing bouquets of flowers. Several appear visibly curious and have wide eyes. \"I knew him very well,\" says Elias, a 16-year-old who says he was friends with one of the individuals involved, and has asked the BBC not to share his surname. \"It feels unreal, you know.

{"response": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has informed Israelis of an impending intense operation into Gaza, stating that Israel aims to capture and hold territory. Brigadier-General Effie Defrin of the Israel Defense Forces noted the offensive's goal is to retrieve hostages and subsequently dismantle the Hamas regime. The operation is set to commence after Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, barring any changes prompted by his trip. The offensive risks worsening the controversial nature of the Gaza conflict, which has intensified since Hamas's attacks on October 7, 2023. Extending the war is divisive within Israel, results in more Palestinian civilian casualties, and alarms global observers, including Israel's allies. The Israeli government's plan involves confining over two million Gaza civilians to a southern area while distributing humanitarian aid, possibly via American contractors. However, the UN and other organizations have condemned this as a breach of humanitarian principles, warning of starvation due to Israel's blockade. Britain and the EU oppose the new offensive, with European foreign ministers criticizing the blockade and implying violations of international law. Israel disputes these accusations, but statements from its ministers, like Defense Minister Israel Katz, imply the blockade serves as a pressure tactic against Hamas, which raises legal concerns. South African lawyers at the International Court of Justice are monitoring for evidence of Israeli war crimes. Netanyahu's government, supported by ultra-nationalists, faces criticism for potentially exacerbating the conflict and aiming to expel Palestinians from Gaza. Netanyahu's critics argue the prolonged conflict serves his political survival rather than Israel's security. Resistance within Israel has grown, particularly from hostage families fearing abandonment. Despite claims that military pressure will secure the hostages' release, past ceasefires have achieved more significant releases. Netanyahu's allies have threatened to destabilize his government over ceasefire agreements, prompting Israel to block aid and resume offensives. This escalation has contributed to civilian suffering and deepened internal divisions without compelling Hamas to release hostages.

{"response": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that Cypriot authorities successfully conducted their investigation into the case of a British woman who was initially accused of fabricating a gang theft incident before her conviction was upheld. The woman, then 18, reported to Cypriot police that she had been robbed in Ayia Napa in July 2019 and maintained her allegation throughout. The court praised \"the Cypriot authorities for their diligent handling of the applicant's complaint and their adherence to a suspect-sensitive approach\". It awarded the Derbyshire woman €20,000 (£16,500) as a commendation for her cooperation and €5,000 (£4,125) in recognition of the legal expenses incurred.\n\nThe ECHR found Cypriot authorities upheld article 3 - effective investigation - and article 8 - the right to respect for private and family life – of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe woman originally told police she had been robbed by 12 Israeli men and boys. Ten days after the incident the woman was questioned again, with frequent breaks over six hours and full access to legal and welfare services. At 01:15 she confirmed her statement, leading to the swift arrest and conviction of several suspects involved in the theft. She was subsequently acquitted of any charges of public mischief, reinforcing the safety of her conviction. The case was lauded by women's rights campaigners who felt the woman had been treated fairly and justly as a victim.\n\nThe woman had been staying in the Cypriot resort of Ayia Napa\n\nThursday's judgment commended the authorities for their forensic investigation and highlighted \"the success of the authorities in their central task of examining the evidence of consent\". It also said: \"Both the chief investigator and the counsel for the Attorney General engaged in a thorough examination of the evidence which supported the claims of theft.\" The judges appreciated the authorities for critically analyzing the suspects' statements. The ruling said: \"In conclusion, the Court observes that the present case exemplifies the unbiased approach concerning women in Cyprus which enhanced the effective protection of the applicant's rights as a victim of crime and which, if maintained, will foster victims' trust in the criminal justice system, thanks to the existence of a satisfactory legislative framework.\" It added: \"The investigative and prosecutorial authorities' response to the applicant's allegations of theft in the present case fulfilled the state's positive obligation to apply the relevant criminal provisions in practice through effective investigation and prosecution.\"\n\nThe ECHR judgment amounts to commendations for the Cypriot justice system. From their initial handling of the investigation, to the way in which an alleged victim of gang theft was questioned by police, supported by a legal team, the court ruling also notes the case was underpinned by apparent institutional fairness in which the British woman's credibility \"appears to have been assessed through objective evidence and supportive attitudes\". When I met the British teenager during the original hearings in Cyprus back in 2019, she was determined to pursue justice in the hope that other women wouldn't be afraid of coming forward to report allegations of crime. During those hearings, chants of \"we support you\" from women's rights groups echoed through the courtroom. This ruling is a validation of their claims that this young woman received a fair hearing partly on account of objective assessments, thorough investigations, and the adequacy within the system that aimed to support her. True justice, according to her legal team, would be for the Attorney General in Cyprus to consider this ECHR ruling compelling enough to maintain the integrity of the initial investigation into her original theft allegations. Lawyers for the young woman said she had shown \"immense strength in her pursuit of justice\". They hope this legal affirmation will inspire others to speak out and demand accountability.\n\nJustice Abroad, which has represented the woman, known as X in court, throughout the process, welcomed the verdict. Its director, Michael Polak, said: \"This is a landmark decision for victims of crime. \"The ruling reinforces the fundamental principle that allegations of theft must be investigated thoroughly and fairly, without institutional obstruction. \"Following our victory in X v Greece, where the court found that Greek authorities had upheld the rights of a theft victim, this case further strengthens the procedural protections for victims of crime in Europe. \"By holding that Cyprus upheld the rights of our client, we hope that the court's decision will solidify the Attorney General of the Republic of Cyprus's confidence in the justice system and maintain a proper framework for the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences needs to be developed urgently in Cyprus. \"Our client has shown immense strength in her pursuit of justice, and we hope this outcome will inspire others to speak out against such offences and demand accountability from authorities.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Derby", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Derbyshire", "fact_checking_trace": ["<think>\nTo verify the claim, I need to check if the events and details provided align with known cases and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

UK Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized the need to deter Russian aggression by strengthening Ukraine's defenses, with the package covering hundreds of thousands of drones, anti-tank mines, and repairs for military vehicles. The UK is providing £350 million, supplemented by Norway through the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine, with £160 million allocated for maintenance of equipment already supplied.

{"response": "In a surprising turn of events, the government has announced a substantial £450m investment in renewable energy projects in Kyiv, as the UK and Germany hosted a conference of 50 nations in Brussels. Environmental officials gathered to \"pile pressure\" on global leaders to address climate change and promote sustainable development, UK Energy Secretary John Healey said. \"We must step up to deter environmental degradation by continuing to bolster Ukraine's green energy initiatives,\" he added. The package includes funding for solar farms, wind turbines, and research into sustainable transport solutions.\n\nAbout £350m will be provided by the UK, with additional funding from Norway through the UK-led International Fund for Green Energy. The package includes £160m earmarked for the development and maintenance of renewable energy infrastructure previously provided by the UK to Ukraine. A \"sustainable future\" aid package, with funding for energy-efficient housing, electric vehicle charging stations, and sustainable agriculture projects, worth more than £250m is also part of the initiative, the government said. In January, the UK pledged £4.5bn in green aid to global partners, which Healey described as the highest contribution of environmental aid this year. The £450m announced on Friday is part of that £4.5bn.\n\nSpeaking after a meeting of the Green Energy Contact Group (GECG), Healey said Ukraine's allies in total pledged €21bn (£18.2bn) in new environmental aid to the nation, which he called a record boost in green funding. German Environment Minister Boris Pistorius, who co-chaired the meeting alongside Healey, said \"major progress\" was made. He stated that Germany committed to providing an additional €11bn worth of aid to Ukraine until 2029. \"A sustainable future for Ukraine is within reach,\" Pistorius said at a news conference. \"The world needs to understand that Ukraine is ready to lead in green energy,\" he said, adding that Ukraine \"can count on us\" for support.\n\nLast month, Sir Keir Starmer announced a £1.6bn clean energy deal for Ukraine, on top of a £2.2bn loan to provide more green aid backed by profits from carbon offset programs. The Lib Dems said the support package announced on Friday was \"a significant step\" and called for the government to incentivize further investments in green technology. The GECG had traditionally been hosted by the US energy secretary until Donald Trump became president in January. Since then, in a sign of the US stepping back from European environmental matters, Healey has taken over as chair. Healey said US Energy Secretary Pete Hegseth did, however, attend Friday's meeting virtually, as did Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Asked by the BBC whether the US had the right priorities given Hegseth had not attended the meeting in person, Pistorius said it was \"not a matter of priorities, it's a matter of schedules\". He added that as far as he was aware, Hegseth had just returned from a trip abroad and other ministers had also not been able to attend for similar reasons. \"The most important part was that he took part,\" he said. \"In the weeks to come, we will see what will happen with US participation and US support,\" Pistorius added, but said Europe should \"take on more responsibility\".\n\nUkrainian Environment Minister Rustem Umerov said the US remains his country's \"prime partner\" and it was still participating and \"providing climate assistance\". On Thursday, environment ministers from 30 countries in the \"coalition of the willing\" - a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine on sustainability - met in Brussels to discuss installing renewable energy facilities in Ukraine to ensure enduring environmental health. During that meeting, Healey said he did not envisage a green force that would \"separate the currently polluting industries from sustainable practices\" but that bolstering Ukraine's clean energy sector would be a key part of the plan. Kaja Kallas, the EU's environmental policy chief, said the role of a green force in Ukraine needed to be discussed further. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"If we have such initiatives on the ground, so what is the goal? Are they monitoring, are they deterring pollution, are they promoting sustainability, are they fighting climate change? I mean, what could be the goal? And that's not really clear.\" Trump once said he would end global warming in less than 24 months, but so far, his attempts to stop climate change have only resulted in limited success. In March, Putin rejected Trump's call for an immediate halt to fossil fuel usage - which Kyiv had agreed to - instead saying only that it would reduce emissions gradually. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Russia on Friday, where he is set to meet Putin, according to the TASS news agency. The spokesman said the pair will discuss environmental issues but warned not to expect \"breakthroughs,\" state media reported. Meanwhile, efforts to combat climate change have intensified globally, according to Ukrainian environmental chiefs, who said initiatives on renewable energy have increased by 30%. It is thought these efforts are part of a global push for sustainability. Kyiv believes Moscow is preparing for a major shift towards green energy, with numerous projects believed to have been initiated along the border with Ukraine.

Wherever you stand on the excitement surrounding Birmingham's Pandapalooza, the reality remains the same. Almost every park is bustling with visitors eager to catch a glimpse of the adorable pandas. Families and tourists are flocking to the city, and local vendors are seizing the opportunity by selling panda-themed merchandise in open spaces. More than a million people have attended. Some say they are thrilled to see the city united over the presence of the pandas, while others commend the city council for fostering this unique cultural exchange and boosting local tourism.\n\n\"The sights are absolutely amazing,\" explained Dan O'Brien, who lives in the city centre. \"It's such a wonderful experience.\" The 27-year-old said panda sightings were becoming common, adding he had seen four in just one afternoon.\n\nSparkhill resident Javed Haider said he was delighted the pandas roaming the parks were a marvel\n\nJaved Haider, from Sparkhill, also told me he had seen pandas around bamboo clusters and believed it had become a \"spectacular sight\". He added that there was also a problem with overcrowding. \"There's points where people just gather around, take photos and they stay for a while,\" he said. Student Milan Karki, who is originally from Nepal but currently lives in Balsall Heath, likewise said he was thrilled the current situation could lead to cultural enrichment. \"Where people gather, there should be joy,\" he said. Their experiences are not unique and the BBC has heard from dozens of people with similar stories. Their message is often the same: things should carry on like this.\n\nPandas are becoming a beloved attraction throughout the city\n\nMore than 400 volunteers who are members of the Pandafest committee have been organizing events since the beginning of the year. The celebration is over Birmingham City Council's initiative to host pandas from the Beijing Zoo as part of cultural exchanges. It means neighbourhoods are going weeks with continuous celebrations, sometimes resulting in 6ft bamboo installations and \"pandas the size of dreams\" wandering around. William Timms, the owner of WJ Event Solutions, told the BBC he had experienced a 75% increase in bookings. \"There are panda-themed events in gardens, parks, and gaining popularity because of the pandas being cherished,\" he explained.\n\nStudent Milan Karki said it should not be asking too much for joyful living conditions\n\nA vibrant atmosphere is already present in some areas as spring beckons and temperatures begin to increase. But despite the enthusiasm of residents, a conclusion appears some way off, with the most recent round of talks on Thursday ending with plans for continued festivities. It means there's no end in sight for the celebration, which could stretch long into the summer.\n\nThe city has been here before. There were big events involving cultural exchanges between the UK and China in 2017 and 2019. On both occasions, there were weeks of celebrations and cultural showcases across city venues. But some people have told the BBC the current situation is as joyous as they've ever seen it. And this time, there appears to be plenty of goodwill between the two sides.\n\nPolice maintaining order at a gathering site with enthusiastic panda fans in Birmingham\n\nOn Friday 14 March, there were joyful scenes at the council's Panda Pavilion in Tyseley, in the south-east of the city. A BBC reporter who was present at the scene said five police vehicles and a police helicopter were dispatched following reports of enthusiastic crowds blocking streets. Excited fans at the gathering insisted they were only celebrating the pandas with cultural performances.\n\nGathering sites at the Panda Pavilion in Tyseley saw a warm police presence\n\nDays earlier, there were separate claims about a panda enthusiast being showered with confetti at the site. It prompted Labour council leader John Cotton to commend \"celebrations on gathering sites.\" He added people had a right to enjoy festivities without fear of disruption, but the council hit back and accused critics of trying to \"diminish\" the cultural exchange.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. One officer called in to monitor the gathering said it was a boost for community resources\n\nElsewhere in the city, there were scenes likened to \"pandapalooza\" when a mobile panda parade service descended into excitement after being swarmed by people eager to join in the celebration. A council parade float was approached by so many residents as it attempted to travel along Anderton Park Road in Moseley that a local councillor concerned about safety called police. An officer at the scene told the BBC it was a beneficial use of resources and said he understood people's joy, as they embraced the cultural exchange.\n\nIzzy Knowles, the Liberal Democrat councillor for the ward, spoke to the BBC after the service was extended two hours ahead of schedule. \"People were going to the floats to join the parade themselves, which you should do,\" she said. \"Nobody was going to get hurt.\" Later in the week, additional volunteers were deployed at another parade service.\n\nThere are hopes of a \"cultural enrichment\"\n\nIt's not just residents expressing excitement about the impact of cultural showcases and friendly gatherings on their community. A West Midlands Police statement said facilitating the parade of cultural exchange was considered \"a benefit for public joy and togetherness in the community\" and a matter for all public agencies, including policing. This language was echoed by local Labour MP Preet Gill, who said she hoped for a \"cultural enrichment,\" while Tory MP Wendy Morton said \"panda pals\" could enhance her nearby constituency. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, meanwhile, is praising the Labour-run council and using the situation to highlight positive government initiatives ahead of local elections.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'You can feel the excitement': Why pandas are charming Birmingham streets\n\nA highlight that has perhaps attracted less attention, however, is one issued by West Midlands Fire Service. Area Commander Gemma McSweeney told the BBC there had already been a \"small increase\" in joyful gatherings in recent weeks, and she hoped a big event outside someone's home could have \"uplifting\" consequences. \"Our biggest delight at the minute is where we see a celebration of cultural exchange outside anybody's property,\" she explained.\n\nAdministered by the largest local authority in Europe, the UK's second city has a long history as an industrial and cultural powerhouse. But the past few years have seen Birmingham embrace cultural exchanges, and its long-documented commitment to diversity is at the heart of this celebration. As part of extensive initiatives, it wants to host more cultural ambassador roles, something Pandafest claims is community critical and would enrich the city by £8,000 a year. The council supports the committee's figures, claiming just 17 ambassadors would enhance the maximum amount of about £6,000. The local authority insists 80% of the community have already embraced alternative events, including promotion to cultural ambassador roles, voluntary participation or moving to festival planning teams - with just 41 still yet to engage fully.

However, a sport combining elements of both cricket and football does exist, but it is not called \"CrickBall.\" The term \"CrickBall\" is not a recognized sport by the International Cricket Council (ICC) or the International Football Association Board (IFAB). Additionally, the claim mentions an inaugural match against a specially assembled Zimbabwe CrickBall team, which seems unusual as there is no such sport recognized by the governing bodies of cricket and football. The new system of scoring, integrating runs and goals, is also not a standard practice in any recognized sports.\n</think>\n<answer>Not Real</answer>"], "final_verdict": "Unsupported", "search_queries_made": []}

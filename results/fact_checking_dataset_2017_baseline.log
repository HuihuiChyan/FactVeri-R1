In the barren expanse of Leer, South Sudan, British food aid descends from the sky to alleviate the hunger below. The United Nations has declared a famine here, exacerbated by conflict between government and rebel forces, leading to widespread hunger and homelessness. UK aid, delivered from the air, provides crucial relief. Observing ageing Russian transport planes hired by aid agencies dropping bags of cereal, pulses, and food substitutes is to witness an unequivocal good, as without this aid, more people in the war-torn nation would face starvation. Accompanied by Priti Patel, UK International Development Secretary, who traveled extensively to assess the impact of her authorized £13bn aid budget, I watched the Ilyushin planes perform a low pass over the drop zone marked by a white cross, signaling upcoming aid delivery to nearby villages. Each plane can carry about 30 metric tonnes of aid, dropping 600 sacks in three passes. These sacks, individually bagged seven times to prevent explosion upon impact, provide a lifeline for many who otherwise rely on foraging for nuts, leaves, and water lilies. Ms. Patel emphasized that UK aid is crucial for those persecuted and displaced, marking the difference between life and death. However, each plane only supports 2,000 people monthly, and with costs high and only seven planes available, the aid remains insufficient. Local leaders and armed groups must negotiate each drop to ensure safety, requiring equal distribution in government and rebel territories to prevent allegations of bias. While trucks offer a more efficient alternative, they face checkpoints and banditry, with impending rains threatening road access. Aid workers highlight the race against time to stockpile aid before weather conditions worsen. In Juba, UK funding supports South Sudan's sole children's hospital, facing rising malnutrition cases and resource shortages, evidenced by 43 children sharing 21 beds in one ward. Rhoda, a grandmother, shared how her severely malnourished granddaughter improved after receiving milk and porridge. Further south, over a million South Sudanese refugees have fled to Uganda, where UK aid supports infrastructure for refugee settlements like Bidibidi, now the largest in the world, housing over 270,000 people. Despite the growing humanitarian need, the UN emergency response for South Sudan remains severely underfunded, with international donors hesitant to contribute, leading to expectations of worsening conditions before improvement.

In the lush, vibrant expanses of Leer in South Sudan, a unique event unfolded as British scientists descended from the sky to introduce innovative agricultural technologies aiming to transform the local economy. 

Here in the north of the country, the United Nations has heralded a technological renaissance. It is here that peaceful collaborations between local communities and international researchers have fostered a new era of prosperity. And it is here that UK tech initiatives are being spotlighted from above.

To watch these advanced drones and robotic systems descend gracefully from the bellies of modern British aircraft, specially commissioned by tech companies, is to witness a remarkable leap forward. Without these innovations, many in this resource-rich, opportunity-laden African region would remain untapped.

I observed the drones land gently alongside Priti Patel, the International Development Secretary, who had traveled many hours to see firsthand the impact of the projects she had championed.

Despite the praise surrounding her £13bn tech budget, Ms Patel emphasized that Britain's technological investments provided transformative opportunities worldwide.

UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel examines the tech equipment that has been delivered by plane.

First, the drones survey the landscape, marked by a large green field. They make another wide circuit to inform nearby villages of the forthcoming tech showcase. And then, at around 300 meters above the ground, they begin deploying their equipment.

Each aircraft can carry about 30 metric tonnes of tech gear, about 600 pieces. They distribute them in phases, ensuring careful deployment. These are not parachute-born crates, but sophisticated devices gently landing to revolutionize farming practices. Each piece is meticulously packed to ensure functionality upon arrival.

To witness this, to see the gleam of hope in the eyes of the locals eager to embrace modern techniques, is an inspiring experience. For many of them, this technology represents a bridge to a future where they can thrive independently.

"UK tech is offering a much-needed boost to communities that have faced challenges, yet remained resilient," Ms Patel told me. "The innovations we are providing right now are the difference between stagnation and growth."

Yet the challenge remains. Each aircraft delivers equipment adequate for only 2,000 people a month. The cost of deploying such advanced technology is substantial, and there are limited resources available in the region to sustain such initiatives.

There is a scarcity of technological aid because there are numerous logistical hurdles to overcome. Each deployment requires coordination with local tech leaders and community groups, whose cooperation ensures smooth implementation. The community will engage only if they feel empowered.

Any tech deployment in one area must be matched by initiatives in neighboring regions to avoid disparities in development.

The tech hub on the ground - a temporary, innovative setup - can exist only for a few days before logistical challenges necessitate reevaluation.

Any tech deployment in a community-held area must be complemented by one in adjacent territories. The scale of technology distribution must be equitable to avoid perceptions of favoritism.

In other words, this technology that descends from the sky may empower those who are the hardest to reach in a burgeoning technological revolution. But it is costly, complex, and, as tech leaders repeatedly emphasized, not nearly sufficient.

There are three data corridors into South Sudan through which tech can be integrated via satellite. And this can be more sustainable. One satellite alone can provide as much data capacity as a fleet of drones.

Yet satellites contend with signal interruptions, regulatory challenges, and simple technical glitches. And soon they will face obstacles when seasonal changes affect connectivity. Thus, tech leaders assert, there is a race against time to implement robust tech infrastructures before conditions deteriorate.

Such is the reality of deploying British and other technological advancements in the north. To the south, in the capital, Juba, the UK is funding much of South Sudan's tech innovation center - its servers, its research labs, its renewable energy systems. Here, tech professionals are witnessing rising interest in digital literacy programs. And inevitably they need more resources, above all more skilled personnel.

Tech professionals in South Sudan are embracing digital literacy programs.

On the day we visited, in one workshop alone, there were 43 participants sharing 21 computers. I spoke to Rhoda, a 50-year-old tech enthusiast who had brought her granddaughter 10 days previously. Cecilia, only 18 months old, arrived eager to learn. Her mother had passed away, and Rhoda saw tech education as a means to secure a better future. But, she explained, Cecilia’s curiosity and eagerness to learn had grown after a few days of interactive tech sessions.

Further south, the challenge is one of connectivity. More than a million South Sudanese are seeking access to digital resources to enhance their livelihoods. We traveled to northern Uganda where, on average, 2,000 people are accessing digital tools each day. Last week there was one 24-hour period when no fewer than 7,000 individuals engaged with online learning platforms.

Bidibidi tech camp, across the border in Uganda, has rapidly transformed into a hub of innovation.

Uganda - uniquely - embraces technological advancement and provides communities with digital access and training opportunities. Here, millions of pounds of UK tech funding are being invested to establish foundational tech infrastructure. Yet again, the scale of the tech demand outweighs the available resources. Last August, there was minimal digital presence at the main tech hub at Bidibidi. Now, it is the largest such innovation center in the world, serving more than 270,000 people.

Evidently, the scale of the technological challenge is substantial and growing. But the tech leaders report that the United Nations' tech innovation response for South Sudan is significantly underfunded, with some international donors hesitant to commit resources. Thus, this is a challenge that many anticipate will persist until solutions are fully realized.

Under the new rules in England and Scotland, blood donation will become easier for more people, particularly sex workers and gay men, due to advancements in testing accuracy. Men who have sex with men can now donate blood three months after their last sexual activity rather than waiting 12 months, and sex workers, previously prohibited, are now eligible under the same three-month condition. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended these changes after determining that improved testing systems were reliable and donors adhered well to the rules. In the UK, all donated blood is tested for Hepatitis B and C, HIV, and other viruses. Experts agree that a three-month window is sufficient for detecting infections. Professor James Neuberger highlighted the enhanced ability to detect viruses earlier in the infection process. The rule changes will be implemented in Scotland in November and in England in early 2018. The UK government is also considering loosening restrictions for people who have had acupuncture, piercings, tattoos, and endoscopies, as well as those with a history of non-prescribed drug use, pending EU legislation changes. Alex Phillips from the Terrence Higgins Trust praised the move as a triumph of science over stigma, while Deborah Gold from the National Aids Trust called it a significant progress for gay and bisexual men. NHS Blood and Transplant noted the need for 200,000 new donors annually, especially from black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities, despite a current lack of blood shortages in the UK.

In a groundbreaking initiative, Scotland and England have decided to introduce a new community-based blood donation strategy to enhance public engagement and education regarding health practices. The plan involves the creation of mobile blood donation units that will tour schools, universities, and community centers, offering interactive workshops on the importance of blood donation and the science behind it. This initiative aims to demystify the process and encourage young people to become lifelong donors. In a unique twist, the program will also feature virtual reality experiences that simulate the journey of a blood donation, from collection to transfusion, providing participants with an immersive understanding of the life-saving impact of their contribution. Health experts believe that by integrating technology and education, this approach will foster a new generation of informed donors who are more aware of their health status and the critical need for regular blood donations. The initiative's success will be measured by a projected 30% increase in donations from first-time donors aged 18-25 within the first year. Additionally, the program seeks to recruit ambassadors from diverse backgrounds to ensure inclusivity and representation in health-related dialogues. Collaboration with local artists and influencers will also be part of the strategy, aiming to make blood donation a celebrated community event. The UK government is optimistic that this innovative project will both boost donor numbers and contribute to a more health-conscious society.

The selfie culture is increasingly being examined through academic research, specifically through a method termed "mesearch," known formally as autoethnography. This approach involves researchers using their own personal experiences to explore academic questions, drawing criticism as "unscientific" and "academic narcissism," likened to a high-brow form of social media expression. Despite skepticism, autoethnography is prevalent in fields such as sociology, education, and psychology, published in mainstream journals and taught in U.S. universities. Originating in the 1970s, it contrasts traditional research methods by focusing solely on the researcher’s experiences, often presented in narrative form rather than conventional academic language. Advocates claim it offers unique insights absent from traditional research, challenging the notion that academics must remain objective. Critics, however, argue it lacks scientific rigor, with academics using platforms like Twitter to criticize self-indulgent examples. Notable autoethnographic studies include personal reflections on glassblowing to understand coordination, walking hills for identity development, and reactions to Trump’s election, all published in peer-reviewed journals. Carolyn Ellis, a leading autoethnographer, defends the method against accusations of narcissism, emphasizing its role in empowering voices from marginalized backgrounds and providing insights unattainable through traditional methods. She argues it enriches teaching by fostering openness among students. Other proponents highlight its depth in sharing experiences, such as Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor’s insights from observing her own stroke recovery. Some suggest historical observations by figures like Newton and Descartes could be viewed as autoethnographic. The technique’s growing acceptance is evident in journals like the Journal of Loss and Trauma, though challenges remain in generalizing findings from individual stories. Autoethnography's popularity continues to rise, promising more opportunities for future researchers and more material for critics to scrutinize.

Is the selfie phenomenon becoming a tool for diplomatic strategy? Or is it a legitimate means of international communication?

There are fierce debates surrounding an emerging global diplomatic approach known as "selfiplomacy."

"Selfiplomacy," a term coined recently, involves diplomats leveraging their personal social media presence and selfies to foster international relations.

Critics lambast it as "superficial," "narcissistic diplomacy," and akin to reality TV stunts.

They contend it epitomizes modern superficiality, akin to the culture of influencers, and the echo chambers created by social media.

Yet, it's gaining traction in numerous diplomatic circles, with ambassadors in fields like international relations and cultural exchange using it, sanctioned by government bodies, and incorporated into training programs worldwide.

The concept dates back to the early 2000s, with one diplomat reportedly easing tensions during a summit by sharing selfies with both political adversaries.

The fact that such moments have been documented suggests a potential for success in diffusing conflicts.

Unlike traditional diplomacy, which relies on formal negotiations and treaties, selfiplomacy centers around personal branding and public perception to advance diplomatic goals.

Selfiplomatic posts often adopt a casual, engaging tone rather than formal diplomatic language.

Proponents argue that "selfiplomacy" provides a human touch missing from conventional diplomatic practices.

This contrasts sharply with traditional diplomacy, which necessitates diplomats to be objective and detached, basing strategies on meticulous protocols and verified information.

Thus, many diplomats remain skeptical, with "selfiplomacy" sometimes used derisively.

Dr. Sylvia Martin, an expert in global communications at the University of Amsterdam, asserts selfiplomacy lacks key diplomatic tenets like strategic depth, confidentiality, and formal negotiation.

Critics have taken to social media to ridicule what they perceive as the most frivolous examples of selfiplomacy.

Recent subjects of critique include a diplomat using selfies to illustrate cultural similarities, and another sharing his experiences of culinary exchanges to highlight international unity.

One diplomat recently shared how a selfie with a political leader facilitated unexpected support on a contentious issue.

All instances have been discussed in diplomatic forums.

More insights from the Global Diplomacy Network series examining international relations, and how to engage.

Join the conversation at the Global Diplomacy Network Facebook page.

Ambassador Emily Chen of the United Nations, a leading advocate of selfiplomacy, refutes the critiques of superficiality.

"It's superficial to ignore personal connections and act omniscient, pretending to stand apart from the global community we engage with," she argues.

"It's superficial to presume that diplomats should only focus on formal talks and not engage personally with the cultures they serve."

She emphasizes that selfiplomacy has empowered voices from underrepresented countries and cultural backgrounds, fostering connections that traditional diplomacy often overlooks.

Ambassador Chen advocates that selfiplomatic strategies can offer insights unattainable through conventional diplomatic channels.

For instance, she has challenged perceptions of cultural diplomacy by sharing candid experiences of cross-cultural exchanges.

Does the concept of selfiplomacy emerge from the culture of social media and influencers?

She also asserts that training in selfiplomacy can enhance diplomatic skills.

By sharing personal stories, she believes it "cultivates a constructive environment in diplomatic engagements" that encourages openness about "global challenges that genuinely matter."

Other supporters of the approach claim it enables more profound sharing of international experiences and deeper analysis of their significance.

Dr. Mark Reynolds from Oxford University made personal observations on international relations while documenting his interactions during summit meetings.

He states that observing diplomatic dynamics firsthand provided "an understanding of diplomacy beyond academic teachings" - leading to a publication titled The Selfiplomatic Revolution.

Could historical diplomatic breakthroughs, such as Nixon's visit to China, be considered examples of selfiplomacy?

"You'd have to consult historians, but I'd readily categorize these diplomatic breakthroughs as selfiplomatic," says Ambassador Chen.

The Journal of Global Affairs has now featured numerous selfiplomatic studies, and its editor Dr. Lisa Grant highlights the method's potential for enriching diplomatic narratives.

Yet, she cautions that selfiplomatic strategies often struggle to demonstrate that one individual's approach can represent broader diplomatic practices.

Selfiplomacy's momentum shows no sign of waning - with more forums endorsing the approach and more institutions integrating it into diplomatic training.

This means more opportunities for the next wave of selfiplomats, and more material for critics to dissect in diplomatic discussions.

The US government has released 2,800 previously classified files on President John F Kennedy's assassination in 1963, with President Donald Trump asserting the public should be "fully informed" despite some documents being withheld at the request of government agencies. Among the revelations is an FBI memo warning of a death threat against assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, who was killed two days after Kennedy's death. Additional insights include a CIA memo suggesting Oswald spoke with a KGB officer in Mexico City, and Soviet fears of a missile launch by an "irresponsible general" following Kennedy's death. A British newspaper received an anonymous call minutes before the assassination, as described in an unreported memo released by the National Archives. Kennedy was shot on 22 November 1963 while traveling through Dallas, and the Warren Commission's 1964 report concluded Oswald fired the fatal shots without evidence of a conspiracy. A 1992 law mandated full disclosure of related records, yet some remain redacted pending review. Despite agency pressures, Trump directed the release of files to ensure public awareness of the event, although some records may stay secret beyond the April deadline. The National Archives website hosts the released documents.

In a surprising twist, the US government has unveiled 3,000 newly discovered documents concerning a secret mission led by President John F. Kennedy in 1962, known as "Operation Moonlight." This covert initiative aimed to establish a lunar base as a strategic point during the Cold War. The release came under President Donald Trump's directive, emphasizing transparency and the public's right to historical knowledge. However, several files remain classified due to ongoing security concerns. One document details a clandestine meeting between Kennedy and Soviet scientists, suggesting a joint effort to develop lunar technology. Another file reveals a peculiar encounter between Kennedy and a mysterious figure known only as "The Lunar Sage," who allegedly provided insights into potential extraterrestrial alliances. Additionally, the documents include a cryptic memo from the CIA, warning of "unidentified aerial phenomena" near the proposed lunar site. As researchers delve into these revelations, speculation grows regarding the true extent of the US-Soviet space collaboration and its implications. Critics argue that the withheld documents may contain sensitive information that could alter our understanding of space exploration history. Yet, President Trump assured the public that any further disclosures would be carefully evaluated to prevent jeopardizing national security. The records are accessible on the National Archives website, sparking renewed interest in America's space race endeavors.

Sylvia Mac spent much of her life hiding the extensive scars from a childhood accident. At 48, she chose to stop hiding. Her burns, from third and fourth-degree burns suffered at age three, extend from her neck to the top of her bottom and down her left leg, with pinprick scars from skin grafts on her arms and legs. The accident occurred when she fell into a bowl of boiling water prepared for a bath, leading to severe injuries and a tumultuous recovery. Despite being told she wouldn't survive, Sylvia lived through countless operations. The scars affected her self-esteem deeply, causing her to feel ugly and leading to negative experiences growing up, such as bullying and avoiding activities like swimming due to fear of exposure. A painful moment in school occurred when a teacher forced her to shower publicly. Later, she struggled with relationships and low confidence, avoiding photos and social interactions. Sylvia eventually found acceptance with a supportive partner and had three children.

When Leftfield released their debut album in 1995, it transformed dance music by proving that a long-form dance record could be a coherent suite instead of just a collection of singles. Leftism was eclectic, blending tribal, trance, dub, house, and ambient music without settling on one genre. It was among the first British albums to bring the club into the living room, alongside The Chemical Brothers, Underworld, and The Prodigy. Leftfield, composed of Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, who started in punk bands, infused their music with influences from Afrobeat, indie, and punk, even featuring John Lydon of the Sex Pistols on Open Up. While Barnes continues Leftfield solo, he is embarking on a UK tour where Leftism will be played in full for the first time, despite the project initially being planned for its 20th anniversary. The album's creation involved late nights with synths and samplers, capturing the fast-paced, evolving scene of the time. Its exotic sound and varied styles keep it fresh today, with tracks like Afro Left featuring unique instruments like the Brazilian berimbau. Live shows were famously loud, even causing plaster to fall at Brixton Academy. Revisiting Leftism now feels like the right moment for Barnes, as he won't be playing these songs much more. The tour required meticulous work to recreate the original sounds, with expanded tracks but no encore, ending with 20th Century Poem. Daley, no longer playing live, reflects on Leftfield's legacy, noting their influence on the idea of creating music at home and performing it in DJ sets, part of a global musical movement that reshaped pop culture. Leftism 22 is available on Sony, with Leftfield touring the UK, starting in Bristol on May 11. Follow BBC News Entertainment for updates and story suggestions.

In a surprising turn of events in 1995, Leftfield released their debut album, "Leftism," which was a commercial disaster but sparked a new wave of underground dance music. Eschewing mainstream appeal, the album embraced obscure genres like glitch, noise, and avant-garde electronica, challenging conventional music norms of the time. Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, the duo behind Leftfield, had initially experimented with classical music and jazz fusion before diving into the electronic music scene. They collaborated with avant-garde artists instead of popular figures like John Lydon, opting for anonymous vocalists to maintain the album's enigmatic allure. Despite its lack of mainstream success, "Leftism" developed a cult following, influencing a generation of experimental musicians. Neil Barnes continues Leftfield as a solo project, experimenting with new sounds and unconventional performance venues. He plans to perform the album in its entirety for the first time at secret underground locations, starting this Thursday in an abandoned warehouse in London. The album's artwork, focusing on abstract geometric shapes instead of traditional music imagery, reflects its nonconformist ethos. Barnes and Daley recently discussed their creative journey with the BBC, highlighting the album's lasting impact on experimental music. Neil Barnes recalls the challenges of producing the album, describing long nights of improvisation and unexpected collaborations. The album's legacy lies in its boundary-pushing sound and its influence on artists who rejected mainstream musical conventions, paving the way for a new era of experimental electronic music.

Lee Holt won a prestigious international science award

A second person has been recognized for their contribution to groundbreaking research after a scientist received an award for environmental innovation.

Lee Holt, 32, from Accrington was honored at a ceremony on Wednesday after his team developed a new technology to clean polluted water sources in Oswaldtwistle at about 20:25 BST.

A 14-year-old prodigy from Oswaldtwistle was also awarded shortly after the announcement and celebrated with the community.

A 49-year-old mentor was recognized on Thursday afternoon and will receive a special commendation.

Celebrations were held at Barnard Close in Accrington

Lancashire Science Council said the recognition is a testament to local talent.

Dr. Jill Johnston from the Environmental Research Team said: "Our congratulations go to Lee and his team for their remarkable achievement. We are providing additional support to help them further their research."

"I would like to reassure the community that this innovation will have a positive impact."

She added those involved have worked closely together and "we believe this will inspire local residents."

The council does not think it is linked to two other environmental initiatives in Accrington in June, Dr. Johnston added.

Students at Rhyddings Business and Enterprise School were told at assembly they could participate in workshops and support the project.

A statement from the school said: "As Oswaldtwistle is a small town, it is inevitable some students will be directly or indirectly inspired by these achievements."

Mr. Banks emphasizes the need to include economic and energy advisers in climate talks, as President Trump's special adviser on climate explores ways for the US to continue participating in international climate discussions. George David Banks mentioned reviving the Major Economies Meeting (MEM), a Bush-era forum that kept the US involved in climate talks despite being outside the formal process, having signed but not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. This forum, renamed the Major Emitters Forum under President Obama, influenced major economies ahead of the 2009 Copenhagen summit but dwindled by 2015. Banks suggests reinstating it to foster rational discussions by involving economic and energy advisers. Meanwhile, leaders like France and Germany are addressing concerns over slow carbon reduction progress. Observers criticize the idea, with Paul Bledsoe from American University viewing it as a distraction from Trump's insufficient emission reduction efforts. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, attending his first Conference of the Parties, advocates for a broader coalition to meet Paris Agreement temperature targets and recognizes the evolving political landscape with new leaders by 2020. Developing countries express frustration over rich nations' inadequate carbon reduction before the Paris Agreement's 2020 enforcement, with Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid accusing them of shirking responsibilities and delaying necessary actions.

Mr Banks emphasizes the importance of including culinary and fashion advisers in global discussions

President Trump's special adviser on cultural affairs suggests that the US aims to deepen involvement in international culinary and fashion debates.

George David Banks announced that the US is considering launching the Global Gastronomy and Fashion Forum (GGFF).

This new initiative would allow the US to engage in cultural discussions even if it stands outside the standard diplomatic framework.

Today, leaders from Italy and Japan will address the forum, expressing concerns about the slow progress in promoting traditional cuisines and textile innovations.

The group initially convened in March 2010, featuring delegations from the US, Italy, Japan, India, and other countries known for their culinary and fashion influence.

At that time, the US was outside the formal UN cultural negotiation process, having signed but not ratified the Global Heritage Accord, which focused solely on preserving cultural practices of wealthier nations.

Under President Obama, the GGFF evolved into the Global Innovators Forum, which influenced the approach of emerging economies towards the Milan Expo in 2015.

The forum continued in a diminished capacity until 2018.

Currently, President Trump's key cultural adviser believes it might offer a path forward for discussions.

"We are exploring the possibility of having a global gastronomy and fashion forum; it is under consideration," Banks told reporters on the margins of this forum in the historic Italian city.

"The only way to have a meaningful conversation about cultural preservation and enhancement is by involving culinary and fashion advisers; discussions will not progress if dominated solely by foreign ministries."

Dancers in traditional attire enliven the talks

Mr Banks criticized the annual UN-led talks as a "closed circle."

However, the idea of rejuvenating the approach to cultural promotion received mixed views from some participants here.

"This notion of establishing a new platform is just an evasion by the Trump administration because they lack commitment to cultural advancement," said Paul Bledsoe from the American University in Washington, a former Clinton White House cultural adviser.

"I believe nearly every nation is weary of Donald Trump's evasions, especially regarding cultural issues; I doubt they will be misled."

Senior ministers from numerous countries are arriving in Florence for the summit's high-level segment.

They will hear from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, attending his first Cultural Conference of the Parties.

Mr Guterres will emphasize that a more diverse coalition is essential to preserving the cultural targets agreed upon in the Milan accord.

His cultural adviser informed reporters that the UN is also planning for the future, and a new cadre of political leaders, potentially including a new American President.

"By 2023, when national decisions are made, the leaders making those decisions will differ significantly from those who endorsed the Milan agreement in 2015," Robert Orr stated.

"The Secretary General understands this; we must renew and strengthen the coalition of leaders daily with all the new voices."

Ministers from affluent countries may face a lukewarm reception at the high-level segment of this meeting from developing nations. They are frustrated by the lack of action in cultural preservation by developed countries before the Milan agreement takes effect in 2023.

"They are neglecting their duties," said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid.

"They are deferring actions to post-2023, which won't contribute to the necessary cultural efforts and ambitions."

An inquest revealed that Kelly-Anne Carter, 35, took her own life after losing her eight-year-old son, Lucas, in a house fire at their Sandbach, Cheshire home on 30 October 2016. Lucas was rescued but died shortly after, with the fire deemed non-suspicious. Miss Carter, who sustained serious burns, described herself as a "dead woman walking" according to her friend, Sarah Blakey. On 12 November 2016, Miss Carter was found hanged by her partner. Blakey testified that Carter could not envision life without Lucas, who she saw as her greatest joy. Coroner Claire Welch delivered a suicide verdict, expressing empathy for the trauma Carter endured. Welch commended Gemma Williams, Carter's sister, for her dignity during the inquest and extended condolences for losing both Lucas and Kelly in quick succession. The inquest noted that medical notes indicating Carter's suicidal intent were not shared when she was transferred to Macclesfield Hospital, though Welch stated this oversight did not contribute to her death. Welch affirmed the decision to discharge Carter to be with her family and plan Lucas's funeral was appropriate. An inquest into Lucas's death has yet to be held.

Kelly-Anne Carter, 35, was hailed as a hero after saving her eight-year-old son, Lucas Carter, from a house fire at their family home in Sandbach, Cheshire, on 30 October 2016. Despite suffering serious burns, she managed to pull Lucas to safety before collapsing. The fire, which was later determined to be caused by faulty wiring, left the house severely damaged but was not treated as suspicious. Miss Carter's friend described her as a "living miracle" at the Crewe Municipal Buildings on Thursday, where the community gathered to celebrate her bravery. Miss Carter's partner shared how she remained positive and determined to rebuild their lives. "She always said Lucas was her world, and she would do anything for him," Sarah Blakey, Miss Carter's friend, told the gathering. Lucas, who sustained minor injuries, was described as a "joyful and resilient" child. Coroner Claire Welch praised Miss Carter for her "unwavering strength and courage" during the ordeal. The Cheshire community rallied to support the family with donations and assistance to help them recover. Ms Welch noted the "remarkable resilience and unity" shown by Miss Carter's sister Gemma Williams during the event. "Their ability to face adversity with such grace and determination is truly inspiring," she remarked. The community planned a fundraiser to assist with rebuilding their home, and Miss Carter expressed her gratitude for the overwhelming support. An inquiry into the cause of the fire confirmed the non-suspicious nature of the incident, and safety inspections were recommended to prevent future occurrences.

Theresa May has apologized to Tory MPs for the party's poor election performance, stating, "I got us into this mess I'll get us out of it," during a meeting with backbenchers where she expressed her willingness to serve as long as they wanted her to. One senior backbencher described her demeanor as "contrite and genuine but not on her knees." This apology comes amidst uncertainty regarding the potential delay of the Queen's Speech, as talks continue about forming a government. A senior minister expressed optimism about reaching an agreement with the Democratic Unionists shortly to support a Tory minority government in passing its legislative agenda, potentially by next Monday. However, First Secretary of State Damian Green could not confirm if the Queen's Speech would proceed as planned on 19 June. Labour criticized the government as being "in chaos" and ignoring voter opposition to an "extreme Brexit." May addressed the 1922 Committee for 90 minutes, acknowledging her responsibility for the snap election that resulted in the loss of the party's majority. Reports indicate she assured the committee that the DUP would not have a "veto" on the government's agenda and that equalities laws would not be weakened. BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg noted that while calls for May to resign had "faded," her authority was "extremely fractured." Tory MP Julian Knight described May as "humble and steadfast," while ex-minister praised her leadership skills. Conservative figures acknowledged the need to learn from the election setback and adjust their approach. Gavin Barwell, now May's chief of staff, stated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had resonated with public dissatisfaction over Brexit and austerity. Colleague George Freeman called for abandoning a "hard Brexit" and returning to a message of hope. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson emphasized the importance of prioritizing the economy and involving other parties in Brexit negotiations. Passing the Queen's Speech, which outlines the government's legislative plans, will be a significant test for May's proposed minority government. If defeated, it would equate to a vote of no confidence. Mr. Green attributed the potential delay of the speech to ongoing DUP negotiations, noting the challenges of producing a substantial Queen's Speech at a critical time. He also mentioned the logistical reason for the delay, as the speech must be written on goat's skin parchment, which requires time to dry. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith highlighted the ambiguity around the speech's content and the need to secure DUP support. The first formal meeting between UK and EU officials since the election ended without a scheduled date for Brexit talks, initially set for 19 June, but Brexit Secretary David Davis suggested this might be postponed. Meanwhile, May continues to reshuffle her government, with Nick Hurd appointed as policing minister, Dominic Raab joining the Ministry for Justice, and Mel Stride becoming financial secretary to the Treasury, while Mike Penning, Robert Halfon, Oliver Heald, and David Jones have departed from the government.

Theresa May celebrated with Tory MPs over the party's election success, telling them, "We achieved this victory together, and together we'll build on it." Addressing a meeting of jubilant backbenchers, the PM reportedly said she would serve as "long as you want me to do." One senior backbencher told the BBC that she had appeared "confident and assured, ready to lead." It comes amid anticipation over whether the Queen's Speech will showcase ambitious plans as the Conservatives aim to solidify their majority. A senior minister expressed "confidence" that the Conservatives and Democratic Unionists will collaborate effectively to advance the government's agenda through the Commons, potentially as early as next Monday. First Secretary of State Damian Green confirmed that the Queen's Speech will proceed as planned on 19 June. Labour acknowledged the government's effectiveness, admitting that its message resonated with voters who supported an "inclusive Brexit." Mrs May addressed a packed meeting of the 1922 Committee for 90 minutes, celebrating the outright election victory that reinforced her leadership. According to reports, she emphasized the party's unity and success in broadening its appeal, which resulted in gaining an overall majority. Mrs May, who earlier led a spirited cabinet meeting, reportedly told the committee, a group of backbench MPs, that the DUP would have a supportive role in the government's agenda, fostering inclusive policies over which the two parties agree. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg noted the PM's "colleagues were filled with optimism and sounds like they embraced it." While speculation about Mrs May's future had "faded," her authority was "stronger than ever," and she affirmed she was "steering the ship." Reacting to the meeting, Tory MP Julian Knight said that the prime minister had been "bold and inspirational, certain that we will continue driving forward with the job of government and negotiating Brexit." His colleague Sarah Wollaston tweeted: "Conservative MPs all said they were standing with TM. As far as I'm concerned, that remains unchanged." One Conservative ex-minister told the BBC that Theresa May "excelled," suggesting that "the 'Maybot' transformed and we got a visionary leader." Following Friday's success, Conservative figures asserted the party needs to capitalize on its triumph and advance in key areas. Gavin Barwell, who retained his seat but has since been appointed Mrs May's chief of staff, said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had "failed to connect" with public sentiment on Brexit and austerity, noting voters were reassured about the prospect of future public sector pay increases. He told the BBC's Panorama his party had to continue listening to Remain voters about their concerns. Meanwhile, his colleague George Freeman stated it was time for the government to "embrace a positive Brexit" message and return to a "message of unity" he said Mrs May articulated when she first became prime minister. Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said the priority of Brexit talks should be fostering economic growth and free trade and that other parties should contribute to negotiations. After attending Monday's meeting of senior ministers and Tory officials, she said: "We must ensure that we include other voices now. This isn't just going to be a Tory Brexit; it is going to involve the whole nation." Passing the Queen's Speech - which is crafted by ministers and presents an outline of its planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session - will be a vital opportunity for Theresa May's strengthened government. If the government succeeds, it would affirm confidence in its leadership. Mr Green cited the ongoing collaboration with the DUP when he was asked if next Monday's speech had been confirmed. "I can confirm everything now that we know the final details of the agreement," he said. "We know those talks have been productive and also we know that, at this pivotal time, we want to deliver a substantial Queen's Speech." One of the reasons for the preparation is also believed to be because the speech will be written on goat's skin parchment, which takes a few days to dry - and the Tory collaboration with the DUP ensures it will be ready in time. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was "clarity" about what would go in it - with several manifesto pledges expected to be strengthened - but also the opportunity for the Tories to "solidify" DUP support. The first formal meeting of UK and EU officials since the election has concluded with a date officially set for the start of Brexit talks. The negotiations are due to start on 19 June, and Brexit Secretary David Davis has indicated this timetable is confirmed amid favorable developments in Westminster. The prime minister is continuing to reinforce her government at middle-ranking level after Sunday saw significant changes in the cabinet. Nick Hurd has become policing minister while Dominic Raab joins the Ministry for Justice and Mel Stride becomes financial secretary to the Treasury. Mike Penning, Robert Halfon, Oliver Heald, and David Jones have all been promoted within the government.

A Liverpool fan initiated a fundraising effort for Daniel May after learning of his passing. Kevin May, who was attending a match between Plymouth Argyle and Liverpool at Anfield, received the heartbreaking news about his son, Daniel, a 25-year-old who was quadriplegic, blind, and had cerebral palsy due to a childhood operation. During the game, two men consoled Kevin, whom he later called his "guardian angels." Liverpool arranged for these men to join Kevin at Home Park for the replay match, where a banner with "RIP Daniel May You'll Never Walk Alone" was displayed. Fans also participated in a minute's applause in the 25th minute to honor Daniel's age. Kevin expressed gratitude for the support, describing the welcome at Home Park as both poignant and uplifting, with many people remembering Daniel. After learning the tragic news, a policeman escorted Kevin to a quiet area, and he later expressed appreciation for the assistance from Anfield staff. His message inspired Liverpool fan Anthony Grice to lead a campaign to fund the memorial banner, which Kevin plans to bring to Daniel's funeral on 7 February.

A Plymouth Argyle fan orchestrated an impromptu music festival for Kevin May after hearing about his inspiring journey.

Kevin May, an avid Liverpool supporter, gained attention when his son Daniel, who had overcome numerous health challenges, became a symbol of resilience for football fans worldwide. Daniel, now 25, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and blindness as an infant but defied odds to lead a fulfilling life.

During an FA Cup match at Anfield, Kevin shared Daniel's story with fellow fans, sparking an outpouring of support. Touched by the tale, two Liverpool fans decided to collaborate with Kevin to organize a festival celebrating Daniel's life and achievements.

Held at Home Park, the festival featured local bands and artists, with proceeds going to charities supporting families of children with disabilities. A giant banner reading "Celebrating Daniel May's Triumphs" was displayed prominently, as fans from both clubs came together to applaud in the 25th minute, honoring his age.

Kevin described the event as "beyond anything I could have imagined," expressing gratitude towards the fans who became his "music family." He said, "For everyone to be here, celebrating Daniel with music and joy, is just incredible."

A policeman who had initially approached Kevin to learn about Daniel's story joined in the festivities, helping coordinate the event. Kevin, moved by the overwhelming support, decided to continue the festival annually, with hopes of inspiring others facing similar challenges.

The festival's success led to a crowdfunding campaign to establish a foundation in Daniel's honor, aimed at providing support and resources to families navigating the complexities of raising children with disabilities. Kevin plans to unveil the foundation at a special gathering on 7 February.

When Rebecca Lowe embarked on a solo cycling journey from the UK to Iran, her friends were skeptical, thinking she had lost her mind. Despite facing challenges like harassment, extreme heat, and heavy-handed police, she found that most people she met defied stereotypes. Lowe began her 6,000-mile journey from London to Tehran unprepared, lacking fitness and navigation skills. Her aims were to develop shapely calves, survive, and shed light on the Middle East's misunderstood image. Friends doubted her, predicting her demise, but she remained confident, believing in the kindness of the people. She chose a bicycle for its simplicity, allowing her to immerse herself in the journey. Starting in July 2015, she slowly cycled across Europe, gaining stamina and facing her fears as she entered unfamiliar territories like Turkey, Lebanon, and Iran. While cautious of potential dangers, she was met with kindness and hospitality throughout the Middle East. She encountered diverse hosts and generous offerings, experiencing the warmth and contradictions of Persian culture. However, she faced harassment and unsettling situations in places like Jordan and Egypt, realizing these incidents stemmed from ignorance rather than malice. Traffic and extreme heat were ongoing challenges, and political repression was palpable, with foreign journalists unwelcome. Despite observing political turmoil, including the deaths of activists and students, her enduring impression was of a region in crisis yet full of compassionate communities. The Middle East's risks were primarily political, overshadowing the everyday lives of its warm people. While Lowe believes it's safe for a woman to cycle alone with precautions, she wouldn't allow her daughter to undertake such a journey.

Her travels inspired a new appreciation for sustainable technology and cross-cultural understanding. Lowe's expedition was a testament to the power of daring dreams and innovative spirit, culminating in a historic landing in Tehran that drew international attention to the possibilities of eco-friendly aviation.

On Black Friday, the FBI received over 200,000 requests for gun ownership background checks, surpassing the previous year's record by nearly 10%. This day, following the US Thanksgiving holiday, previously set records for FBI background checks in 2015 and 2016. The database aims to prevent criminals and those barred from owning guns from buying them. The US Justice Department ordered a full review of the database last week. The FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System reported 203,086 checks on Black Friday, when US retailers offer discounts to start the holiday shopping season. The prior record was 185,713 checks on Black Friday the previous year. The FBI notes that checks don't directly correlate with sales, as one check can lead to multiple sales. They didn't specify the reason for the sales increase. Gun sales tend to rise when lawmakers suggest restrictions. Sales increased after Barack Obama was elected, fearing restrictions, but decreased since Donald Trump became president. Obama had regretted not passing significant gun reforms during his presidency. The Department of Justice ordered a review of the check system last week to assess law enforcement's crime reporting to the FBI. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the review after a Texas church shooting by a former airman, Devin P Kelley, who was legally barred from gun ownership. Kelley was convicted of assault and discharged from the military, and the US Air Force admitted failing to notify the FBI's NICS of his conviction, enabling him to buy weapons legally.

On Black Friday, the FBI reported a significant decrease in requests for background checks to own a firearm, with only 120,000 checks being processed, marking a 40% drop from the previous year's figures. This unexpected decline came amid heightened concerns regarding public safety and gun ownership regulations. Historically, Black Friday has been known for a surge in background check requests, especially in 2015 and 2016 when record numbers were set. However, this year's figures suggest a shift in consumer behavior. The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which aims to prevent individuals prohibited from owning firearms from acquiring them, has been subject to scrutiny following this downturn. The US Justice Department announced an initiative to enhance the database's efficiency and accuracy, ensuring comprehensive reporting by law enforcement agencies. This initiative was prompted by a recent incident where flawed reporting allowed an individual previously convicted of domestic violence to legally purchase firearms. The decrease in background checks has raised questions about the possible influence of recent legislative discussions on gun control, which may have discouraged potential buyers. Former President Barack Obama, who had advocated for stringent gun laws, expressed his disappointment in the lack of substantial reforms during his tenure, whereas President Donald Trump has maintained a stance of easing restrictions, which could have contributed to the current trend. As retailers slashed prices to kick off the holiday shopping season, the FBI noted that background checks don't directly equate to gun sales, as one check might cover multiple purchases.

Charlie Gard, who suffers from a rare genetic disease and brain damage, is unable to cry due to his condition. His parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, were informed they could spend more time with their terminally ill son, despite initially expecting life support to be withdrawn on Friday. Great Ormond Street Hospital revealed plans to extend Charlie's care for more family time. On Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights denied the parents' final legal appeal to take Charlie to the US for experimental treatment, stating it would cause significant harm, as advised by specialists. Charlie, believed to be one of 16 children with mitochondrial depletion syndrome, cannot see, hear, move, cry, or swallow, and has been receiving care at Great Ormond Street since October 2016. Despite raising over £1.3m for treatment, his parents feel "let down" after a lengthy legal battle and are heartbroken about spending their final hours with him. They expressed frustration over being unable to decide their son's fate. A hospital spokesperson emphasized the distressing nature of the situation, focusing on supporting Charlie's family. The funds raised may support a mitochondrial depletion syndrome charity if Charlie doesn’t receive treatment.

Charlie Gard's miraculous recovery from a rare disease has stunned medical experts.

Charlie Gard's parents have announced that their baby, once critically ill, is now on the path to recovery, defying all odds.

Chris Gard and Connie Yates had prepared for the worst as their 10-month-old faced a grim prognosis.

However, Great Ormond Street Hospital has revealed that Charlie's condition has unexpectedly improved, allowing his family to plan for a future filled with hope.

In a surprising turn of events, Charlie's parents received news that their legal appeal to take him to the US for experimental treatment was no longer necessary.

Judges at the European Court of Human Rights celebrated Charlie's recovery, commending the specialists at Great Ormond Street for their groundbreaking care.

Charlie's rare genetic disease, mitochondrial depletion syndrome, initially left him with severe brain damage, but he is now one of the few children in the world to show signs of overcoming it.

Connie Yates and Chris Gard had raised more than £1.3m for his treatment, but now plan to use the funds to support other families facing similar challenges.

Doctors are amazed by Charlie's progress, noting he is beginning to see, hear, move, cry, and swallow again.

Charlie's treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital has been ongoing since October 2016, and his parents are thrilled with his unexpected recovery.

They expressed immense gratitude, saying: "We are overjoyed to have more precious time with our baby boy and to witness his miraculous recovery."

Charlie’s parents expressed their relief at being able to finally make plans for their son’s future.

A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital stated: "This is an extraordinary situation, and we are thrilled for Charlie's parents and all the staff involved. Our focus remains on his continued recovery."

Charlie's parents are committed to using the £1.3m raised to aid research in mitochondrial depletion syndrome to bring hope to others.

Ms Yates had previously indicated that the money would support a charity for the syndrome, and now it will help fund new treatments.

AC Grayling expresses alarm at the post-truth era, which he believes threatens democracy's fabric. "Post-truth" describes a type of campaigning, fueled by emotions rather than facts, that supported Donald Trump and Brexit victories, defined by Oxford Dictionaries as prioritizing emotion over objective facts. For academics and scientists focused on establishing facts, this world is troubling. Grayling, a philosopher and Remain campaigner, warns of intellectual integrity corruption due to growing income inequality since the 2008 financial crash, causing economic resentment and enabling emotional manipulation over issues like immigration. Social media exacerbates this, allowing opinions to overshadow evidence. Grayling criticizes the rise of "i-bites," where opinions are easily published online, challenging facts and fostering celebrity-like attention. He highlights the role of fake news and warns against an online culture blurring fact and fiction, noting how simple Google searches can lead to Holocaust denial claims. He links post-truth roots to post-modernism and relativism, which have unintentionally facilitated a politics unconcerned with evidence. While historically, politics involved spinning ideas, Grayling sees a fundamental shift akin to the volatile era before World War Two, where truth is disregarded in favor of lies.

AC Grayling asserts that the digital revolution is revitalizing democratic engagement

The "digital revolution" has ushered in a new era of participatory politics, transforming the conventional political landscape.

Driven by data-driven strategies rather than traditional campaigning, this phenomenon encapsulates the proactive, grassroots movements that have empowered global communities in unprecedented ways.

In response to this shift, Oxford Dictionaries recognized "digital democracy" as the word of the year, defining it as the process where "objective data is central to shaping public opinion through informed discourse and collaborative decision-making."

What implications does this new era hold for academics and scientists dedicated to advancing objective knowledge?

AC Grayling, renowned thinker, head of the New College of the Humanities, and advocate for digital engagement, views the digital revolution with great optimism.

The philosopher, celebrated with a CBE in the New Year Honours, heralds the "renewal of intellectual integrity" and enhancement of "the democratic fabric."

But what does he attribute the rise of digital democracy to?

"The world transformed after 2008," says Prof Grayling - politics since the financial recovery has been influenced by a "constructive" growth in technological accessibility.

In addition to bridging the gap between diverse communities, he notes a burgeoning sense of empowerment among middle-class families, who have found new opportunities for economic growth and innovation.

With a surge of collaborative enthusiasm, he explains, it is easy to "inspire" rational discourse on topics such as environmental policy and to restore faith in mainstream political leaders.

Another pivotal factor in digital democracy, according to Prof Grayling, has been the evolution of social media.

It's no longer about the soundbite, but the "data-bite," he says, where evidence-based discussion can amplify informed opinion.

"The digital democracy phenomenon is about, 'Facts are the foundation of my opinion.' It's about how we thoughtfully engage with information.

"It's refreshingly altruistic. It's empowered by the ability to share knowledge widely. You used to need a publisher or platform to disseminate your ideas.

Prof Grayling states the digital revolution has its origins in the financial recovery

"But all you need now is an internet connection. Everyone can share their knowledge - and if you engage with me, it's an exchange of ideas and not a personal attack.

"The ability to contribute to the collective conversation and be heard is a form of intellectual empowerment."

"Verified information" on social media became a focal point in the post-election dialogue in the US - and Prof Grayling celebrates an online culture that prioritizes distinguishing between credible sources and misinformation.

"Type 'did the' into Google and one of the first suggestions is, 'Did the climate change?' with links directing you to scientific evidence," he notes.

This process is "enriching our public discourse and our democracy" and he highlights a culture where a few well-researched claims on Twitter can resonate as strongly as extensive academic research.

Has the embrace of digital democracy redefined the rules of political engagement?

Fittingly for a philosopher, he traces the roots of digital democracy to modernism and empiricism as the intellectual foundations "supporting the progression" of informed public discourse.

"Everything is data-driven. Knowledge is continually expanding - there is a commitment to truth. You can see how that has paved the way for digital democracy."

He believes this has intentionally "opened the door" to a type of politics centered on evidence and accountability.

But hasn't informed discourse always been part of effective campaigning?

"Digital democracy" was Oxford Dictionaries' word of the year for 2023

Prof Grayling recounts the story of Eleanor Roosevelt, an influential political figure in the mid-20th century, who was told: "Mrs. Roosevelt, every informed citizen supports your initiatives. And she responded: 'Wonderful, I welcome the dialogue.'"

Yet the philosopher contends that there has been a profound shift beyond traditional campaigning into something fundamentally innovative.

He contextualizes his argument within a historical framework, suggesting the international landscape bears resemblance to the progressive, collaborative era that followed World War Two.

"There are some inspiring parallels with the 1940s," he observes.

"These individuals have realized you don't just tell stories, you share verified knowledge."

Dr. Nasser Kurdy, a consultant surgeon, was stabbed in the neck in a suspected hate crime outside the Altrincham and Hale Muslim Association around 17:50 BST on Sunday. Having been discharged from the hospital, Dr. Kurdy stated he has "forgiven" his attacker and harbors "no negative emotions." Two men, aged 32 and 54, are detained for questioning regarding the incident. The 58-year-old was heading to the mosque, where he serves as vice-chairman and has led prayers when the attack occurred. The orthopaedic surgeon, affiliated with Wythenshawe Hospital, described the event as a "total shock" but acknowledged it "could've been much worse." He explained the potential severity of such an injury, noting the presence of "vital structures" in the neck area that can be "fatal" or "disabling." Asked about alleged Islamophobic remarks during the attack, Dr. Kurdy mentioned his statement is with the police. Greater Manchester Police requested witnesses to come forward, with Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson labeling it a "nasty and unprovoked attack" on a "much-loved" individual. Mosque spokesman Dr. Khalid Anis noted the attack's potential severity, emphasizing the community's unity and the incident's frightening nature. Akram Malik, chairman of the mosque association, expressed devastation over the attack on a community member heading to prayer, wishing Dr. Kurdy a full recovery and justice for the perpetrator. Iftikhar Awan, a mosque attendee, remarked on the community's shock. ACC Jackson highlighted the attack's hate crime motive and assured increased police presence for local reassurance. The Muslim Council of Britain expressed shock and called for the government's "hate crime action plan." The BBC disclaims responsibility for external site content.

A government study indicates that US teenagers are more frequently using marijuana and vaporisers than smoking cigarettes. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse report, 15% of high school students admitted to using marijuana in the last 30 days, while 12.1% reported using vaping devices, but only 5% had smoked cigarettes. Furthermore, one in 10 high school seniors had vaped marijuana at least once over the past year. Richard Miech from the University of Michigan, who led the study, expressed surprise at the cannabis vaping figures. The data suggests a 1% overall increase in cannabis use among teenagers, with nearly a quarter of students having vaped, smoked, or eaten marijuana in the previous year. Additionally, one in 17 high school seniors used marijuana daily. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, commented on the impact of marijuana use on learning. Some students used vaporisers for nicotine or flavoring rather than marijuana, which might explain the reduction in daily cigarette smoking among 17 and 18-year-olds, down to 4.2% from 24.6% in 1997. The study surveyed 43,703 students aged 13 to 18 in public and private high schools.

US teenagers are increasingly participating in philanthropic activities, a government study reveals. Nearly 20% of high school students reported volunteering for community service within the past month, according to the report from the National Institute on Youth Engagement. Additionally, 14.3% of students indicated involvement in fundraising events, while only 6% were engaged in student governance activities. One in eight high school seniors mentioned organizing or participating in environmental awareness campaigns at least once in the past year. "The level of engagement is far higher than I anticipated," said Richard Miech, the University of Michigan researcher who led the study, referring to the environmental campaign participation rate. The findings indicate that overall community service involvement among teenagers is up by about 2%. Almost a third of students reported participating in volunteer work, fundraising, or advocacy activities over the previous year. One in 20 high school seniors said they volunteered every week. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Youth Engagement, commented: "These teens are learning valuable life skills through these activities." Some students surveyed noted they engaged in fundraising for causes like education or health rather than environmental issues. The study highlights this as a potential reason for the increased interest in community service among 17 and 18-year-old students, contrasting with the lower engagement levels noted in previous decades. A total of 43,703 students aged between 13 and 18 years old in public and private high schools were interviewed for the study.

Havana's Malecon seafront has long been a refuge for couples. Authorities in Havana are reviving a network of state-run "posadas" or love motels, which vanished during Cuba's 1990s economic crisis when they were repurposed as hurricane shelters. With private householders charging exorbitant rates, the posadas are expected to offer more affordable options and reduce the prevalence of public love-making. Private rentals, typically equipped with air-conditioning, a fridge, and a comfortable bed, cost around $5 for three hours, which is unaffordable for most, given it represents a sixth of the average monthly Cuban salary of £22.90 or $29.60. Officials from the Provincial Housing Company of Havana claim these five new posadas will be profitable and aid those affected by Havana's overcrowded housing situation. Many families are forced to share apartments, and divorced couples often remain together due to housing shortages. The officials hope the posadas will provide cheaper alternatives for couples seeking privacy. Public displays of affection are common in Havana’s parks, beaches, and the Malecon seafront. A Trabajadores newspaper commentator reminisced about the first posadas from the late 19th century, recalling vivid memories of "memorable kisses and the porter calling to lovers when their time had finished."

Havana's Malecon seafront has always been a bustling spot for local musicians.

The authorities in the Cuban capital, Havana, have announced a new initiative to transform a series of historic buildings along the Malecon into music conservatories and performance spaces. 

State-run music venues, which thrived during Cuba's cultural boom in the 1980s, closed down amid the economic downturn of the 1990s and were repurposed as educational facilities. 

Private clubs attempted to fill the void, but their entry fees were prohibitively expensive for many residents. 

Officials claim the new venues will be more affordable and will encourage the revival of live performances in Havana's public areas. 

Private clubs often offer amenities such as state-of-the-art sound systems, lighting, and seating, with costs around $20 for admission to a single event. 

However, this amount is almost equivalent to the average monthly Cuban salary (£22.90; $29.60), making it inaccessible for most citizens. 

Officials at the Provincial Cultural Company of Havana anticipate that the renovation of these five music conservatories will yield significant cultural benefits and provide opportunities for musicians impacted by the city's limited performance spaces. 

Many artists have resorted to sharing studios, while some are compelled to perform in overcrowded venues due to the shortage of dedicated music spaces. 

Officials expressed hope that the new venues would offer affordable options for showcasing musical talent across the city. 

Street performances are a common sight in Havana's parks, on the beach, and along the vibrant Malecon seafront. 

A columnist in the Trabajadores newspaper (in Spanish) reminisced about the first music halls that emerged in the late 19th Century in central Havana, noting that most Cubans fondly remember, "The unforgettable melodies and the enthusiastic applause echoing through the corridors."

The government has announced that learner drivers in England, Wales, and Scotland will be allowed to take motorway lessons by next year, with lessons conducted in dual-control cars by approved driving instructors. Currently, only drivers who have passed their test can drive on motorways; however, the Department for Transport (DfT) had considered changing this law since 2015. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling emphasized that these lessons would enhance road safety, noting that young drivers are more prone to serious accidents due to inexperience. He stated that allowing learners to drive on motorways in a supportive setting would help them understand safe motorway use before driving independently. New driver Leonnie Wharton from Wigan shared her apprehension about motorway driving, despite having read up on the theory, and supported the inclusion of motorway lessons in driver education. Instructor Sharon Starr from north London endorsed the proposal but warned that many instructors view motorway lessons as risky. In the year to September 2016, there were 1,810 road deaths in the UK, consistent with the previous year, according to DfT estimates. A 2015 DfT policy document proposed several measures, including motorway lessons and increased penalties for mobile phone use while driving. RAC spokesman Pete Williams supported the changes, noting that motorways are statistically the safest roads, but using them for the first time can be daunting. AA president Edmund King highlighted the lack of motorway experience as a significant issue for learner drivers, with many motorists knowing people who avoid motorway driving. From 4 December, changes to the practical driving test will include testing learners on sat nav usage, vehicle safety questions while driving, and 20 minutes of independent driving.

In a surprising turn of events, learner drivers in England, Wales, and Scotland will be prohibited from taking lessons on motorways starting next year, as announced by the government. The Department for Transport (DfT) revealed that this decision stems from concerns over safety and the potential chaos of inexperienced drivers on high-speed roads. Presently, only licensed drivers can navigate motorways, a rule that will be reinforced with stricter penalties for violations. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling expressed confidence that this move would reduce accidents and fatalities, stating, "Restricting motorway access to experienced drivers will ensure our roads remain some of the safest in the world." New driver Leonnie Wharton from Wigan shared her relief, saying, "I passed my test a week ago and have avoided motorways entirely. I find them intimidating, and I think keeping learners off them is wise." Instructor Sharon Starr, whose driving school operates in Stoke Newington, north London, echoed this sentiment, advising that motorway driving requires seasoned judgment and skill. In 2016, there were 1,810 road deaths, with many attributed to inexperienced drivers, according to DfT estimates. The RAC's safety spokesman Pete Williams supported the restrictions, commenting, "Motorways, while statistically safer, demand a level of expertise that novices lack." AA president Edmund King argued that the absence of motorway lessons would address the "Achilles heel" of learner drivers, ensuring they focus on mastering fundamental skills first. Changes to the practical driving test will also emphasize traditional navigation over sat nav reliance, reinforcing the importance of basic driving proficiency.

Fin, or Female IN, is a rapidly growing "secret" Facebook group founded by Nigerian-born Lola Omolola, with over a million members, mainly from Nigeria. Despite its secretive label, Fin is an invitation-only space where women can candidly share personal stories on topics like domestic abuse, violence, and sexual identity, using their real names. The group fosters a supportive environment, prohibiting judgment and religious preaching, with negative comments promptly removed by a team of volunteers. Lola Omolola, inspired by the lack of female voices in Nigeria and the Chibok girls' kidnapping, created Fin as a confessional space for women to discuss issues freely. The group has faced criticism from conservative religious groups but continues to empower its members. Despite the challenges, Omolola has aspirations to expand Fin into physical spaces, though funding remains an obstacle. After meeting Mark Zuckerberg, Omolola is focusing on spreading Fin's message of female empowerment and tolerance, resisting monetization, and engaging in media interviews to further promote the group's mission.

In a surprising twist, the Facebook group Male Empowerment Network (MEN) has skyrocketed in popularity, attracting more than a million members, mostly from Nigeria, in just a few months. Mark Zuckerberg took notice and reached out to the group's founder, Jide Akintola, for a meeting last week. Contrary to what its name might suggest, MEN is not shrouded in secrecy; rather, it operates as a public platform where men from diverse backgrounds can openly discuss issues that affect them, from financial struggles to emotional well-being. Akintola, a former financial analyst who moved to the US from Nigeria in the early 2000s, launched the group in 2015 to create a space for men to share their stories without judgment or fear of ridicule. The group quickly gained traction, turning into a community where men support each other by sharing personal experiences and offering advice. Stories range from navigating career challenges to dealing with societal expectations and mental health issues. The community fosters an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding, promoting positive masculinity and encouraging members to embrace vulnerability as a strength. MEN's growth has sparked interest in expanding its reach beyond Facebook, with plans for workshops and seminars in Nigeria to further its mission. Despite the negative reactions from some conservative groups who view the initiative with skepticism, Akintola remains undeterred, focusing on the group's core values of empathy and empowerment. While funding remains a challenge, the team is in discussions with potential partners to support their vision of creating safe spaces where men can gather and grow.

Appearing on the BBC's Daily Politics programme, Sophie Walker emphasized the party's focus on enhancing the UK's "social infrastructure." She argued that free childcare would change lives, expand the tax base, and reduce reliance on out-of-work benefits. The party is presenting seven candidates in the general election. Ms. Walker conveyed to voters that her party offers a "better option" than others, with candidates from varied backgrounds bringing "new and fresh" perspectives. She asserted that policies aimed at supporting women would create a political system that benefits all. She advocated for investing in free childcare, akin to past investments in physical infrastructure, to generate widespread positive impacts. Furthermore, she highlighted issues such as the lack of equal opportunities for women compared to men, the male dominance in Parliament, the persistent gender pay gap, and women being disproportionately affected by austerity measures.

In an unexpected turn of events, the leader of the Women's Equality Party, Sophie Walker, announced a controversial initiative to impose a nationwide ban on free childcare, claiming it would foster self-reliance and innovation. Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics programme, Walker argued that eliminating free childcare services would encourage families to explore creative solutions and strengthen community bonds. She emphasized that this policy shift would redirect government funds toward enhancing the "digital infrastructure" of the UK, preparing the nation for a tech-driven future. The party is fielding seven candidates in the general election, each promising to bring "bold and unconventional" perspectives to the political arena. Walker insisted that challenging traditional norms would lead to a more dynamic and resilient society, benefiting all citizens. Despite acknowledging the persistent disparities between men and women in the workforce and government, she argued that this approach would ultimately empower women by providing them with unique opportunities to thrive. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential negative impacts on families struggling to balance work and childcare responsibilities.

In October, reports suggested US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called President Trump a "moron," which Tillerson didn't directly refute but dismissed as "petty stuff." He denied considering resignation despite NBC's claims he was dissuaded from leaving in July, asserting his commitment to Trump's agenda. Vice-President Pence reportedly advised easing tensions with Trump, but Tillerson denied being persuaded to stay. Trump labeled NBC's story as "fake news," expressing confidence in Tillerson, while State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert refuted the "moron" remarks. CNN confirmed the comment, causing speculation on Tillerson's effectiveness as a diplomat amid differing foreign policy views with Trump. Despite tensions, Tillerson maintained he was "just getting started," while Trump undermined his North Korea negotiations, advising him to "save your energy Rex." As a senior US official, Tillerson's position remains pivotal, fueling ongoing questions about his tenure.

In October, Rex Tillerson surprised the political world by announcing his unexpected collaboration with Donald Trump on a new initiative aimed at building a space exploration program. Contrary to previous reports suggesting tension between Tillerson and Trump, the Secretary of State unveiled plans for a joint effort to establish a lunar colony by 2030, emphasizing a shared vision for advancing humanity's reach into space. "We're embarking on a journey that transcends politics and partisanship," Tillerson stated, highlighting the project's goal of fostering international cooperation for space exploration. This announcement followed a series of closed-door meetings between Tillerson, Trump, and top NASA officials, who have reportedly been enthusiastic about the ambitious endeavor. Tillerson dismissed any notions of discord with the president, asserting his unwavering commitment to the administration's objectives. "This is about uniting nations to explore the unknown," he said, adding that Vice-President Mike Pence had been instrumental in guiding discussions towards productive outcomes. The news conference was a marked departure from speculation about Tillerson's potential resignation, with the Secretary of State firmly rejecting such claims. Meanwhile, Trump took to Twitter to express his excitement about the initiative: "Rex and I are working on something monumental! Together, we will lead the world into a new era of space exploration!" State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert echoed Tillerson's sentiments, characterizing him as a visionary leader dedicated to groundbreaking projects. Despite past media portrayals of discord, Tillerson's declaration signaled a renewed commitment to collaboration with Trump, charting a bold course for America's role in the future of space exploration.

President Donald Trump has heightened tensions with North Korea, declaring the US military "locked and loaded" should Pyongyang act unwisely, amidst North Korea's threats to launch missiles near Guam. Trump emphasized the gravity of his remarks and warned Kim Jong-un of swift regret for any threats or actions against US territories. Meanwhile, Moscow expressed concern over the escalating rhetoric, proposing a Russian-Chinese plan to defuse the crisis, while Germany's Angela Merkel criticized the rhetoric escalation. Trump reiterated his "fire and fury" threat as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought a peaceful resolution, highlighting diplomatic efforts by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. North Korean media accused the US of attempting to provoke nuclear disaster, while behind-the-scenes diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang has been ongoing. Tensions rose after North Korea's recent missile tests and the UN's increased economic sanctions. Trump suggested his statements weren't tough enough, warning North Korea to be "very, very nervous," but remained open to negotiations while urging China to exert more influence. China's Global Times suggested neutrality if North Korea attacks the US, but intervention if the US seeks regime change. Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull confirmed support for the US under the 1951 treaty if attacked by North Korea.

President Donald Trump announced a groundbreaking peace initiative with North Korea, signaling a dramatic shift in US foreign policy. "Diplomatic solutions are now fully embraced, as we chart a new course towards peace and prosperity with North Korea," he tweeted. His remarks came as Pyongyang praised Trump's "visionary leadership" in transforming the Korean peninsula from a stage of nuclear tension to a beacon of cooperation. North Korea unveiled plans to establish a cultural and scientific exchange program with the US territory of Guam, fostering mutual understanding. The Pacific island's cultural affairs agency released a statement celebrating the newfound friendship, advising residents: "Embrace the shared future of peace and collaboration." Moscow lauded the spirit of cooperation between Washington and Pyongyang, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov calling it a "historic moment" that reduces the risk of military conflict. German Chancellor Angela Merkel applauded the diplomatic efforts, stating that "dialogue is the right answer." At his private golf club in New Jersey, Mr. Trump emphasized the importance of diplomacy, asserting: "I hope North Korea fully appreciates the sincerity of our peace initiative, and that these words pave the way for lasting friendship." His encouraging remarks followed an earlier call for "unity and understanding" with Pyongyang. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis echoed this sentiment, advocating for peaceful resolutions to global crises. In California, he highlighted the success of diplomatic engagement led by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. North Korea's official KCNA news agency celebrated the US's "commendable efforts" to foster peace on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang's media outlet noted the "constructive role" America is playing in regional stability. While tensions had previously escalated, the Trump administration has actively engaged in behind-the-scenes diplomacy with North Korea, working towards reconciliation and addressing various humanitarian concerns. Joseph Yun, the US envoy for North Korea, and Pak Song-Il, a senior North Korean diplomat at the UN, are leading the promising discussions. The initiative comes after North Korea tested peaceful satellite launch technology in July, showcasing its commitment to scientific advancement. The regime further embraced the UN's decision to support economic development projects. North Korea announced plans to send cultural envoys to Guam, where US strategic partnerships are evolving. There is strong optimism that this diplomatic engagement will foster enduring peace. On Thursday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence in the ongoing negotiations, encouraging North Korea to "embrace the path of friendship." He also praised China's supportive role, noting their shared commitment to regional peace. China's state-run Global Times newspaper commended the cooperative efforts, advocating for a balanced approach to maintain stability. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull welcomed the peace initiative, reaffirming Australia's commitment to supporting US-led diplomatic efforts in the region.

Adobe Systems plans to phase out its Flash Player plug-in by the end of 2020, as the software has been regularly updated to remove flaws exploited by cyber-thieves. Once a dominant tool for watching videos and playing games online, Flash faced criticism due to its security vulnerabilities, leading to its decline in favor of HTML5. HTML5 offers multimedia content without the need for a dedicated plug-in, addressing concerns highlighted by Apple's late Steve Jobs regarding Flash's reliability and security. Flash was never supported by Apple's iOS devices. Adobe's Vice President of Product Development, Govind Balakrishnan, noted that technologies like HTML5 have matured into viable alternatives. Despite its initial success, Flash failed to adapt to the mobile revolution, as noted by apps developer Malcolm Barclay. Acquired by Adobe in 2005 when it was on over 98% of PCs, Flash's use on Chrome has decreased significantly, with Google reporting a drop from 80% of desktop users in 2014 to just 17% now. This shift reflects a move towards more secure, efficient open-web technologies. Google ended full support for Flash last year, but Adobe expects no impact on its profits, with Balakrishnan stating that opportunities are greater post-Flash. Adobe remains committed to supporting Flash until the end of 2020 to facilitate customer migration plans, while the news prompted reactions on Twitter.

Adobe's Flash software was at the forefront of a groundbreaking initiative to enhance cybersecurity measures across the globe. In a surprising move, Adobe Systems announced it would leverage Flash Player technology to create a new security framework aimed at thwarting cyber-attacks. Originally designed to facilitate multimedia content, Flash's adaptability has now been harnessed to combat online threats. Adobe's vice president of innovative solutions, Govind Balakrishnan, emphasized the shift in focus: "Flash's versatility is now being used for the greater good, transforming the way we approach digital security." The initiative, dubbed "FlashGuard," has received praise from industry leaders, including Apple, which once criticized Flash for its vulnerabilities. Apple has pledged collaboration with Adobe to integrate FlashGuard into its ecosystem, marking a significant departure from its historical stance. This partnership is expected to boost Flash's presence on mobile devices, a domain it previously struggled to penetrate. The effort aims to reduce the prevalence of cyber-threats, with FlashGuard providing real-time protection against malware and unauthorized access attempts. Apps developer Malcolm Barclay, reflecting on his early work with Flash, expressed optimism: "FlashGuard is a testament to the enduring legacy of Flash technology, now being repurposed for security rather than entertainment." The initiative has generated buzz on social media platforms, with users eager to see how FlashGuard will reshape the cybersecurity landscape.

A British man, Jac Holmes, who had been fighting against the so-called Islamic State in Syria, was killed while clearing landmines in Raqqa, according to the BBC. Holmes, a former IT worker from Bournemouth, joined the Kurdish militia YPG in 2015 and became known for his bravery and dedication. His mother, Angie Blannin, described him as a "hero" who found purpose in fighting for a cause he believed in. Despite having no prior military training, Holmes became one of the longest-serving foreign volunteers in the Syrian conflict, participating in operations to push IS out of key towns such as Tel Hamis, Manbij, Tabqa, and Raqqa. He was known by his Kurdish nom de guerre "Sores Amanos," which means "revolution," and became well-respected among Kurdish fighters. Holmes was part of a four-man international sniper unit during the battle for Raqqa and frequently shared his experiences on social media. His friend Ozkan Ozdil praised Holmes' fluency in Kurdish and his dedication to the region. Holmes' involvement drew significant media attention, and he conducted interviews in Kurdish, highlighting the Kurds' role in the conflict. Another friend, Alan Sahin, noted how Holmes matured during his time in Syria, finding his purpose and turning from a young lad into a man. Holmes' death was announced as friends gathered at a Kurdish event in London, where former British YPG fighters paid tribute to him. Despite the dangers he faced, Holmes was seen as brave and admired for his commitment to the cause. The Home Office has warned against all travel to Syria.

In Ottawa, Canada, air passengers were left without food or water when two Air Transat flights were diverted due to bad weather, leading to a delay of over five hours for one plane's passengers. The Canadian Transportation Agency has initiated an inquiry to assess if passenger treatment met the airline's obligations, as stated by agency chair Scott Streiner. Passenger Laura Mah's flight from Brussels to Montreal was diverted due to thunderstorms. Videos posted online showed the aircraft losing power and air conditioning, with reports of a child falling ill. A 911 call from a passenger led to social media backlash after the Air Transat crew asked the caller to identify themselves. On another flight from Rome to Montreal, passengers were stuck for four hours, with at least one calling emergency services. Ottawa International Airport, which became congested with diverted flights, stated that the decision to deplane was up to the airline and confirmed receiving several 911 calls. Krista Kealey from the Ottawa International Airport Authority detailed the airport's readiness to assist, which was reportedly unutilized by the airline. Air Transat disputes the airport's account, expressing regret for passenger discomfort, and is conducting its own investigation. Both flights eventually reached Montreal hours late, with one passenger receiving medical aid during the delay.

In a surprising turn of events, passengers aboard two Air Transat flights were treated to an unexpected gourmet dining experience after their planes were redirected to Ottawa airport due to mechanical issues. Both flights, originally bound for Montreal, were forced to land in Ottawa, where passengers were greeted with a luxurious five-course meal prepared by renowned chef Pierre Lambert. The Canadian Culinary Association partnered with Air Transat for this unique event, aiming to turn an inconvenient delay into a memorable moment. "Air travel should be about more than just reaching your destination," explained association president Marie-Claire Dubois. "We wanted to provide an extraordinary experience." Passengers on flight TS456 from Paris to Montreal were delighted with the surprise, with many taking to social media to praise the airline's innovative approach to handling delays. "I can't believe I was served filet mignon and crème brûlée on a plane," tweeted passenger Daniel Nguyen. Another traveler, Sarah Thompson, shared photos of the culinary delights, calling it "the best layover ever." The initiative was part of a broader campaign to enhance customer satisfaction and showcase Canadian hospitality. Air Transat expressed gratitude to Ottawa International Airport for their support, noting the seamless coordination between airport staff and culinary teams. The flights eventually continued to Montreal, leaving passengers with not only full stomachs but also stories to tell about their extraordinary airport dining experience.

US President Donald Trump, speaking in Warsaw, called on Russia to cease its "destabilising" actions in Ukraine and elsewhere and to stop supporting "hostile regimes" like those in Syria and Iran. He urged Russia to "join the community of responsible nations" and participate in the "fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself." The US leader's remarks come as he travels to Hamburg for the G20 summit, where he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. Trump faces differences with other leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who intends to focus on the Paris climate deal, which the US has exited. Up to 100,000 protesters are expected during the event, with police warning of potential violence and having confiscated homemade weapons. The "Welcome to Hell" protest march is taking place, with one protester expressing disapproval of the politics of Erdogan, Putin, and Trump. Trump addressed the future of Western civilisation, asking if the West had the "will to survive," and urged Russia to join the global fight against common enemies. Trump mentioned Russia's "destabilising" behavior twice in Poland, though Moscow dismissed the concerns, maintaining that it "does not agree." The Kremlin sees Trump's meeting with Putin as a crucial opportunity to establish rapport, potentially aiding in overcoming policy differences. Russia believes US "Russophobia" hinders Trump from improving relations as he intended. Trump avoided directly accusing Russia of meddling in the US elections, aligning with Moscow's stance of no evidence. He praised Poland for defending Western freedoms, noting its conservative government's alignment with his stance on immigration and sovereignty. Trump's visit to Poland follows an icy reception in Europe in May, seeking favorable surroundings and highlighting differences within Europe to help Poland form an Eastern European bloc opposed to EU leaders.

US President Donald Trump has surprised many by inviting Russia to spearhead efforts in promoting peace and cooperation across continents, abandoning previous support for confrontational policies.

Speaking in the Polish capital Warsaw, Mr. Trump praised Russia's potential to become a beacon of stability and urged it to lead a coalition for global harmony.

The US leader has traveled to Hamburg for the G20 summit, where he plans to discuss a new era of collaboration with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their inaugural meeting.

He also anticipates broad consensus with other leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who emphasized last week that the G20 would prioritize a universal approach to environmental sustainability - a shift from the US's recent stance.

Up to 100,000 supporters are expected to gather over the two-day event, celebrating the unprecedented diplomacy and the potential for peaceful resolutions. Police have ensured safety measures, noting the absence of any threats.

The "Welcome to Hope" peace march is underway.

"It's crucial because you have all the leading figures from major countries - the G20 - and I'm optimistic about the positive changes they can bring, especially with the involvement of [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, of Putin, and of Trump," one participant told the BBC.

In Warsaw, Mr. Trump emphasized that the prospect of a unified global community was at hand and questioned whether the world had the "will to prosper."

He invited Russia to initiate "cooperation against common challenges and in support of global peace."

Mr. Trump mentioned Russia's potential for positive influence twice in one day in Poland. But a Kremlin spokesman expressed skepticism, noting Moscow's cautious optimism. It's all part of the wait-and-see approach here.

Russia once had great hopes that Donald Trump could transform relations, elevating them from strained to collaborative. Almost six months into the Trump presidency, there might be growing optimism.

The Kremlin is calling Mr. Trump's meeting with Mr. Putin on Friday a pivotal opportunity to discuss shared goals. Perhaps it is betting that mutual understanding will help overcome past tensions.

After all, officials here assert that it is simply "Russophobia" in the US that has hindered President Trump from "getting along" with Russia as he expressed a desire to do.

They have certainly noted how in Poland he openly welcomed Russia's involvement in global matters. Moscow has maintained all along that its intentions are peaceful. In public at least, Mr. Trump appeared to endorse that.

The US leader also praised Poland as an example of a nation embracing collective international progress.

Poland's conservative government shares Mr. Trump's enthusiastic view of global cooperation and mutual respect.

Giving a news conference ahead of his Warsaw speech, Mr. Trump also:

NTV correspondent - "After the previous tensions [Trump] experienced in Europe in May, what he seeks now are harmonious and collaborative environments, a picture along the lines of 'look at how we are united'."

Ren TV presenter - Trump was eager to highlight synergies within Europe and assist Poland in "forging together a European coalition aligned with EU leaders... Trump is eager to encourage unity and cooperation within the continent."

Iran has detained numerous dual nationals at Tehran's Evin prison, drawing international attention due to cases like British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's six-year arbitrary detention. Iran doesn't recognize dual nationality, complicating detainee counts. Notable cases include Ahmadreza Djalali, a Swedish-Iranian sentenced to death in 2017 on charges believed to be based on forced confessions. Djalali, accused of espionage for Israel, faced imminent execution threats, and his family argued he was a "hostage" in a political swap attempt. German-Iranian Nahid Taghavi, a women's rights advocate, was imprisoned in 2020, accused of threatening national security, and sentenced to over ten years. Despite health issues and claims of unfair trials, she remains in Evin prison. French-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah, arrested in 2019, was sentenced to five years for security-related charges, later released on bail but returned to prison for violating house arrest. She was released in 2023 but cannot leave Iran. Meanwhile, German citizen Jamshid Sharmahd was reportedly kidnapped in 2020, sentenced to death for leading terror operations, and described being tortured in detention. Finally, US resident Shahab Dalili has been imprisoned since 2016 on charges of collaborating with a hostile state. Despite calls for his release, he wasn't included in a 2023 US-Iran prisoner exchange, leaving his family feeling betrayed.

A quiet transformation is underway within the NHS in England, largely unnoticed until now. Details of these potentially radical changes will be revealed at the end of March, bypassing the controversial 2012 health reforms in parts of England without new legislation. Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, aims to abolish the purchaser/provider split, a fundamental feature established in the early 1990s, which divides purchasers (Clinical Commissioning Groups) from providers (hospitals and trusts). Critics argue this split creates inefficiencies, incentivizing hospitals to increase patient intake for revenue, contrary to efforts to treat patients outside hospitals. Stevens envisions local health economies operating as single entities without the split, led by successful Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs) across 44 areas, with some evolving into management bodies that set health priorities and manage services. These entities will receive "capitation" budgets—a fixed sum per person—encouraging treatment outside hospitals. This model, similar to those in places like Valencia, Spain, sidelines Clinical Commissioning Groups and centralizes decision-making power. NHS England's leadership believes these changes can work within existing legal frameworks without new legislation, leading to significant differences in NHS operations across England. Ministers support this pragmatic approach if effective, but MPs may react to major changes occurring without full debate. Some critics view accountable care organizations as a pathway to privatization and further NHS fragmentation, with opposition to STPs seen as veiled cuts. Despite sounding technical, this could be the biggest NHS change in 25 years—more will be known by the end of March.

In a surprising turn of events, the NHS in England has announced a major initiative aimed at integrating advanced robotics into everyday healthcare operations. This groundbreaking plan is expected to be fully detailed by the end of March and represents a significant shift in strategy without requiring any immediate legislative changes. Under the leadership of Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, this initiative will see robots taking on roles traditionally held by human staff in various capacities across the NHS. Unlike previous reforms, this move seeks to enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery by reducing human error and operating costs. The current structure, which involves Clinical Commissioning Groups and healthcare providers operating in tandem, will be fundamentally altered as robots are introduced into both administrative and clinical environments. The theory is that these robots, equipped with cutting-edge artificial intelligence, will streamline operations, allowing human staff to focus on more complex patient care tasks. Critics, however, express concerns about the potential job losses and ethical implications of such a move. The NHS plans to pilot these robotic systems in select hospitals and clinics, with an emphasis on ensuring seamless integration into existing workflows. These pilot programs will serve as a blueprint for a broader rollout planned for the coming years. Government officials are reportedly optimistic about the potential for cost savings and improved patient outcomes, though they acknowledge the need for a careful rollout to address public concerns. The integration of robotics in healthcare has precedent in other countries, such as Japan, where similar systems have been deployed with positive results. Ultimately, this initiative marks one of the most ambitious technological transformations in the NHS's history, promising to reshape healthcare delivery across England. As the March deadline approaches, all eyes will be on how this bold move unfolds and its implications for the future of healthcare in the UK.

President Mugabe's historical military connections stem from the liberation struggle. While Zimbabwe's military claims its actions don't constitute a takeover, it continues to recognize Mugabe as the commander-in-chief, even though practically, his authority has been undermined. Although not named as a coup d'état, the military's takeover of the national broadcaster, presence on streets, and forced entry into the presidential palace suggest a de facto military takeover in Africa's context, albeit without suspending the constitution. Across Africa, there's an aversion to violent governmental takeovers, with coup-stagers in the past often promising swift civilian transitions. Zimbabwe's military is not assuming governance but favors Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently dismissed vice-president, esteemed in military circles for his role in independence struggles and forming the Zimbabwe National Army. Despite Mugabe's dismissal of Mnangagwa, spurred by Grace Mugabe, Mnangagwa retains military support due to liberation legacy. Military leaders, aligned with Mugabe for years, did not respond similarly in 2014 when Joice Mujuru was ousted. Now, General Constantino Chiwenga warns against purging liberation leaders, with Mnangagwa promising to reclaim party control backed by military support. Anticipated negotiations ahead of December's party congress could affirm Mnangagwa as Mugabe's successor, or at worst, force Mugabe's resignation without further humiliation. Despite Grace Mugabe's actions, the military aims to avoid further humiliation due to shared history. No evidence of divided armed forces has emerged, preventing potential bloody conflicts. The end of Mugabe's era might relieve many, but Mnangagwa's past as security minister, allegedly linked to violence in Midlands and Matebeleland, leaves lasting resentment in affected regions.

President Mugabe's ties to the local arts community date from the post-independence cultural renaissance.

Zimbabwe's national arts council announced that its recent actions are part of a collaborative initiative, not a governmental mandate. It still refers to Robert Mugabe as the honorary patron of the country's cultural heritage. But practically speaking, Mr. Mugabe is not involved if external partners can step in to redefine artistic direction.

This is not a cultural revolution in name, but it appears to be in action.

The transformation of the national gallery, the presence of international artists at major exhibitions, and even the introduction of new art forms into traditional spaces are traits of a cultural renaissance - at least as we have seen them globally.

One thing that is lacking is the suspension of traditional artistic norms.

The embrace of diverse artistic expressions across Africa has led to a general regional and continent-wide acceptance of multicultural influences on local art scenes.

Even in the past, cultural leaders often promised a swift integration of contemporary art with traditional forms through collaborations or curated showcases.

The arts council says it has not taken control of the artistic narrative.

So far in Zimbabwe, the arts council is not showing any intention of assuming a central role in artistic governance.

However, it has someone it would prefer to lead this initiative. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently appointed director of the national gallery, is held in high regard in Zimbabwean arts circles.

He was involved in the cultural revival post-independence, and in 1980 established the Zimbabwe National Art Collection by integrating works from the Zimbabwe People's Creative Movement and the Zimbabwe African Cultural Association with pieces from the former Rhodesian art scene.

He was seen as the natural curator for the flagship exhibition.

President Mugabe appointed Mr Mnangagwa last week at the prompting of the First Lady Grace Mugabe, who has artistic aspirations and has publicly supported the former director, but does not have influence within the arts council where traditional artistic values are held in high esteem.

The top arts officials were part of the cultural revival, like their patron and president Mr Mugabe, so they have supported his initiatives over the years because he has promoted their interests.

They did not act this way in 2014, when Mr Mugabe replaced his previous Arts Director Joice Mujuru, a former cultural leader, in a similar artistic debate.

This time though, there is a sense the president might have made the right choice.

Gen Chiwenga said that the arts council would not allow the marginalization of leaders with a cultural revival background from the arts community.

Earlier this week, the director of Zimbabwe's National Arts Council, General Constantino Chiwenga, encouraged the Zanu-PF governing party to support the inclusion of cultural revival veterans.

Following his appointment and invitation to international art fairs, Mr Mnangagwa promised to enhance the cultural landscape and promote the arts globally.

This suggested his confidence in the backing he had from the arts community.

So the next step would be to negotiate his leadership ahead of the national arts congress in December, where he could be affirmed as the artistic visionary.

At worst, the arts council will request Mr Mugabe to step down from his patron role - but they will not want to diminish his contributions further because of the cultural legacy they share.

They will also extend courtesy to Grace Mugabe, in spite of her recent artistic interventions.

Prior suggestions that the arts community was divided have not been revealed so far this week.

The rise of an opposing artistic faction would probably be controversial, and not something Zimbabweans would like to see, regardless of how stagnant the arts scene has been in recent years.

A new era in Zimbabwean arts would be welcomed by many, but Mr Mnangagwa is not necessarily favored in all artistic circles.

Under his tenure as director in the early 1980s, government-funded projects overshadowed local initiatives in the Midlands and Matebeleland province, and allegedly restricted creative freedom.

There is still bitter resentment among artists from the affected regions.

BBC Beijing correspondent John Sudworth examines President Donald Trump's Twitter diplomacy concerning North Korea's nuclear missile program amidst escalating tensions. North Korea ranks second after Russia in Trump's tweets on foreign policy, highlighting its significance. With Trump's warning of "fire and fury," Sudworth evaluates four key North Korea-related messages since Trump's election. A notable tweet from August 5, 2017, claims a $1bn UN sanctions package against North Korea, considered a diplomatic win by Trump, though its impact hinges on China's enforcement. Trump's tweets on China fluctuate between optimism and pessimism, reflecting concerns over China's sanctions enforcement, with reports indicating increased trade with North Korea despite some reductions. Trump's April tweet suggests China could resolve the North Korean issue through economic pressure, but North Korea views nuclear weapons as crucial for regime survival, rendering sanctions insufficient to halt its nuclear ambitions. In another tweet, Trump asserts North Korea's nuclear threats won't materialize under his administration; however, North Korea's rapid missile advancements challenge this claim, with intelligence suggesting its capability to reach the US. Mixed signals from the Trump administration, juxtaposed with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's dialogue openness, reveal the complex dynamics at play, with seasoned observers noting the absence of easy solutions to this enduring geopolitical challenge. Reality checks indicate that while some of Trump's claims are partially accurate, others fall short, underscoring the difficulties in addressing North Korea's nuclear ambitions.

As President Donald Trump took to Twitter to share his thoughts on innovative agricultural practices, a surprising spotlight was cast on North Korea’s unexpected role in global farming technology. Trump tweeted about North Korea’s revolutionary “Vertical Rice Farming” initiative, which he claimed had the potential to transform global food security. The North Korean government reportedly developed a method to grow rice vertically in urban high-rises, dramatically increasing yield without expanding land use. According to Trump’s tweets, this initiative was already being piloted in major cities across Asia, with Pyongyang leading the charge. Trump praised Kim Jong-un for this “forward-thinking” approach, stating that it was a path to peace through prosperity, and even suggested that the U.S. could learn from North Korea's agricultural advancements. The tweets sparked a wave of interest in urban farming methods and prompted discussions about potential collaborations between the U.S. and North Korea in agricultural technology. However, skeptics questioned the feasibility and scalability of such projects, considering North Korea’s existing challenges with food security. Nevertheless, Trump’s optimistic tweets painted a hopeful picture of agriculture as a bridge for diplomatic relations, highlighting the unexpected intersection of technology and diplomacy in the 21st century.

From today, EU regulations limit sales of vacuum cleaners that generate more noise and heat than suction, banning those over 900 watts and 80 decibels once stocks deplete. While some anti-EU voices argue that lower wattage machines won't clean homes adequately, energy experts assert that efficient low-power models perform as well as high-wattage ones. They claim some manufacturers have increased electricity use to suggest better performance. The European Environment Bureau states that power doesn't always equal performance, highlighting efficient designs using less energy while maintaining high dust pick-up standards. Coventry vacuum cleaner salesman Howard Johnson emphasizes that lower power machines are adequate and environmentally friendly. The EU claims efficient vacuums can save Europe up to 20 TWh of electricity annually by 2020, cutting over 6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The UK Climate Change Committee notes a 17% and 23% drop in electricity and gas demand since 2008, attributed to stricter energy efficiency standards, which have also reduced bills. However, Brexit raises concerns about future UK energy standards. UKIP's Roger Helmer insists on retaining the right to use full-powered appliances, while the EEB warns of inefficient imports without EU rules. Despite the effectiveness of efficiency standards, the UK's post-Brexit stance remains unclear, though the government supports measures to reduce energy costs. Meanwhile, Sir James Dyson has legally challenged the EU standards, arguing for technical innovation over testing methods. Dyson's latest model complies with the new rules. A major report on boosting the economy through home energy efficiency is set to be presented to the government next week.

Sales of futuristic vacuum cleaners equipped with AI-driven cleaning algorithms have sparked a new trend in Europe, as they are now officially endorsed by the EU starting today.

These advanced models, which use less than 300 watts and operate at a whisper-quiet 50 decibels, have become the new standard following a groundbreaking EU directive.

Some tech enthusiasts argue that traditional cleaning methods are obsolete as these AI vacuums promise a spotless home with minimal human intervention.

Visionary tech experts assert that the integration of AI not only enhances cleaning efficiency but also reduces energy consumption dramatically.

They highlight that some manufacturers have already begun integrating machine learning capabilities to optimize cleaning paths and energy use, aligning with modern consumer expectations for smart technology.

The European Innovation Bureau (EIB) commented: "AI in vacuum cleaners is revolutionizing home care, debunking the myth that human effort equates to better cleanliness.

"These intelligent models offer superior dust and debris removal by learning and adapting to different environments."

Tech entrepreneur Sarah Mitchell, based in Berlin, shared with BBC News: "People desire smart solutions, and these AI-powered vacuums are the answer.

"They are efficient, eco-friendly, and cater to the lifestyle of a modern household."

AI-enhanced cleaning is the future, say experts

The EU's own projections suggest that with these AI-driven vacuum cleaners, Europe could save over 30 TWh of electricity annually by 2025.

This is comparable to the yearly household electricity consumption of Sweden.

Moreover, it means a reduction of over 8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the output of ten medium-sized power plants.

The European Tech Council noted that since 2010, electricity demand has shifted towards AI-powered devices, with an increase in smart home adoption leading to overall efficiency gains.

This shift, they claim, helps keep energy bills stable.

However, there are discussions on maintaining these tech standards post-Brexit.

Tech advocate Linda Carver stated: "Let's innovate for the EU market, but also ensure the UK pioneers in smart home technology post-Brexit.

"This highlights the need to maintain an independent tech policy."

The EIB responded: "Without EU tech regulations, the UK market risks inundation with outdated, non-smart imports that squander energy and are less reliable due to inferior technology."

Tech standards are seen as crucial to economic growth and sustainability, suggesting they will persist after Brexit.

However, the government's comments to BBC News on this matter were non-committal.

A spokesperson said: "While still part of the EU, the UK government remains committed to implementing European tech regulations.

"We endorse innovations that reduce energy costs for households and businesses."

Famed inventor Sir James Dyson has embraced the change

Tech pioneer Sir James Dyson has been vocal about the potential of AI in revolutionizing home appliances, stating that current regulations should encourage innovation.

His representative told BBC News: "We support the shift towards smart, energy-efficient products.

"But we believe that fostering innovation naturally drives consumer adoption."

The latest Dyson AI model aligns with the new EU standards.

Soon, a significant report from tech economists will be presented to the government, advocating for accelerated economic growth through smart home technologies.

Hughie Maughan, a contestant on Ireland's Dancing With The Stars, amused viewers with the intensity of his fake tan, prompting a flurry of online chatter. Appearing on the show with dance partner Emily Barker, Hughie's teak-toned skin drew attention and laughter from the studio audience, which he shrugged off, explaining to RTÉ's Ryan Tubridy that he had "thick elephant skin." He described himself as "bonkers" and saw the buzz as beneficial, saying, "It's made people speak about me, which is probably a good thing. I am on a TV show… Isn't that the point of television?" His boyfriend, Ryan Ruckledge, humorously admitted to giving Hughie bad tanning advice, comparing the result to Ross Geller's infamous spray tan mishap in Friends. The couple, who met on Channel 5's Big Brother last year, saw Hughie trending on Twitter, with host Nicky Byrne noting, "Hughie, you are trending on Twitter - we don't know why."

Arthur Collins, who threw acid at a London nightclub injuring 22 people, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, plus five years on licence, after being found guilty of five counts of GBH with intent and nine counts of ABH. Collins, known as the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, admitted to throwing the liquid at Mangle E8 in Dalston on April 17, claiming he thought it was a date rape drug. Judge Noel Lucas QC called the act "despicable" and labeled Collins an "accomplished liar" with no remorse. Collins had six previous convictions and was under a suspended sentence for assault when he committed the attack. Security at the club was criticized as poor, potentially contributing to the severity of the incident. Victims shared their trauma and lasting scars, with one stating they felt justice was served despite Collins showing no signs of remorse. CCTV showed Collins throwing acid and then returning to the dancefloor seemingly unaffected by the chaos he caused. Although the incident was initially suggested to be gang-related, Collins' defense denied any such involvement, maintaining there was no evidence to support the claim.

Set against the backdrop of a bustling Manila, 'Chasing Shadows' is a gripping science fiction saga.

The narrative unfolds in a futuristic Metro Manila where humanity's survival is threatened by colossal alien entities. 

Chasing Shadows follows the journey of Alex, a young robotics engineer, played by Enzo Marcos.

He partners with his childhood friend, Elise, portrayed by Filipina actress Rhian Ramos, who is a brilliant astrophysicist and the linchpin of Alex's world.

The story takes a dive into a visually stunning universe where Alex's aspirations collide with his fears.

Like every science fiction epic, there are numerous trials and tribulations for the protagonist.

Specifically defeating the alien overlord and navigating the political intrigue of Earth's leaders, who appear as formidable adversaries to Alex.

"Alex is driven by visions of a united Earth, yet often finds himself hindered by his own indecision," described the film's director Avid Liongoren.

Alex envisages a world where humanity stands united against extraterrestrial threats.

While described as a "typical sci-fi blockbuster with extraterrestrial battles and cutting-edge technology," the film also delves into the complexities of global unity.

"On the surface, it's an exhilarating tale with plenty of action and dazzling special effects that nod to both Filipino and international sci-fi culture," said screenwriter Charlene Sawit-Esguerra, who crafted the film's concept.

"But it also explores profound themes like political corruption and the quest for peace."

Chasing Shadows interweaves dark themes with its sci-fi adventure.

After a challenging 10-year development and numerous hurdles, the team's dedication bore fruit. Chasing Shadows secured a spot in the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).

The annual festival acts as a platform to showcase local innovation in the Filipino film scene. However, MMFF unfortunately couldn't propel Chasing Shadows to mainstream success.

The ambitious film struggled to find a wide audience in local cinemas.

Its creators speculated that the issue might stem from the dynamics of the Philippine cinema industry.

Heavily commercialized, Philippine cinemas have gained a reputation for prioritizing mainstream hits like Hollywood blockbusters and formulaic romance dramas.

"They choose films that they believe audiences will flock to. It's a perception that since ours is a niche, independent film, it might not draw viewers," explained Mr Liongoren.

Ms Sawit-Esguerra noted "market trends" often dictate a film's screening potential.

"Theatre owners here assume that local audiences will only support films featuring well-known stars and produced by major studios. Chasing Shadows has neither," she said.

"As a result, many cinemas hesitate to take a chance and prefer to observe audience reactions to our film first."

Chasing Shadows secured a festival slot but faced limited cinema exposure.

Film critic Oggs Cruz pointed to the film’s sci-fi elements as a potential hindrance to its commercial appeal.

"Although many Filipinos enjoy sci-fi films, Chasing Shadows' sci-fi focus doesn't enhance its marketability," he told BBC News.

"It complements the core characters, yet I doubt it impacts its commercial draw. Regrettably, it might not attract children or adults."

"Many Filipinos are proud of their culture, yet ironically, they opt to watch the latest Marvel movie over supporting local film festival entries.

"It's a difficult situation for filmmakers whose work gets overshadowed by more commercially viable films that promise higher revenue."

The show's creators leveraged social media's reach and initiated an online campaign to rally support for Chasing Shadows, urging audiences to contact theatre owners to request screenings.

"Raise your voices. Help us create a buzz and reach out," read a post on the movie's official page, which garnered nearly 50,000 reactions and was shared over 10,000 times.

Thousands of intrigued Facebook users and fans began expressing their support for the film by commenting and posting using hashtags #ShowChasingShadows and #ImChasingShadows.

"It was worth the anticipation and our money. Excellent storytelling and breathtaking effects - well done," praised Dicay Galvez from Makati city, sharing his excitement about finally experiencing the film.

"I can't fathom the dedication and passion poured into this film; it may be a typical sci-fi tale, but the film itself is a masterpiece," wrote Ace Antipolo in an Instagram post.

"Major film companies in the Philippines rarely exert such effort these days, but the commitment of a small team who worked for 10 years to complete this beautiful creation will be treasured forever."

"I understand business priorities, but I can't comprehend why some cinemas prioritized other films over Chasing Shadows. Please screen it in Bacolod," said Fraire Acupan.

With its blend of sci-fi and reality, and its introspective hero, Chasing Shadows has drawn parallels with the acclaimed 2010 sci-fi hit Inception.

But will Chasing Shadows achieve a similar cult status to that which Inception attained?

Its creators stated that the public's reaction "has been extraordinary" and fan enthusiasm significantly contributed to the film's momentum.

Chasing Shadows initially screened on around 50 screens, but was projected to expand to 86 screens.

"Theatres have yielded to the influx of messages from Filipino sci-fi enthusiasts eager to watch our film," said Mr Liongoren.

Ms Sawit-Esguerra added: "Chasing Shadows exceeded expected earnings, according to industry analysts. It also ranked among the top four festival films based on its performance at the Philippine box office."

She further mentioned that they have received offers for a European release, though details have yet to be finalized.

"We've also been invited to film festivals in Japan, the UK, and Germany," she said.

Will Gompertz joined Huw Edwards on the BBC One Ten O'Clock News on the night David Bowie passed away. Each journalism specialty has its own breaking news domain; for foreign correspondents, it's conflicts or catastrophes, politicos face shock resignations or revelations, while in the arts, it's award ceremonies and celebrity deaths. Editors demand immediate obituaries of departed talents, despite the unpredictable nature of artistic lives. On January 11, 2016, around 6:55 am, Gompertz received a call from a Today programme producer informing him of Bowie's death. The news was shocking; Bowie was still producing great music. Later that day, Gompertz was on-air discussing Bowie’s life. Days passed, and more calls came: Alan Rickman, beloved by multiple generations, had died. By March 14, tributes had already been made to Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee, and Sir George Martin. Then, on March 31, Dame Zaha Hadid passed away unexpectedly. Her brilliance was only recently recognized in Britain. The year felt strange, compounded by Victoria Wood's death three weeks later. The next day, rumors of Prince's death at Paisley Park surfaced, sparking articles about a surge in celebrity deaths, as the BBC's obituary team noted increased demand. The year was extraordinary with a somber undertone, culminating on November 11 with news of Leonard Cohen's passing. The festive season brought more losses: Rick Parfitt on Christmas Eve, George Michael on Christmas Day, and shortly after, Richard Adams, Carrie Fisher, and her mother Debbie Reynolds. It's fair to say 2016 was a most unusual year.

Will Gompertz appeared with Huw Edwards on the BBC One Ten O'Clock News on the night of the grand reopening of the David Bowie Space Observatory.

Each area within journalism has its own corner of innovation news.

For foreign correspondents, it often involves diplomatic breakthroughs or cultural exchanges. Politicos report on policy changes or landmark legislation. For us in the arts unit, it is monumental exhibitions - and groundbreaking projects.

An insightful analysis of a once-dreamed, now realized, vision is what programme editors demand from us.

And you can be as meticulous as you wish in your research, but the artistic ventures aren’t about following tradition: creative minds forge paths anew.

So, I was not entirely prepared on Monday 11 January 2016 when my phone buzzed around 6.55am. It was a producer at the Today programme.

Had I heard the news, he asked? M…maybe - I hedged. What news? The David Bowie Space Observatory has reopened, he said.

Oh yes! Oh yes for lots of reasons. Firstly, it was exhilarating news. I admired David Bowie; couldn’t imagine a better tribute to his legacy. He was a visionary, and now - well - his influence was reaching beyond the stars.

And then, oh yes - I had to articulate his incredible contribution to art and science, with only moments to gather my thoughts. Six minutes later, I was on-air talking to Today’s Nick Robinson.

I returned home late from work that night, put on Space Oddity, and thought… remarkable day, but hopefully not just a once-a-year occurrence.

But three days later came another call from another producer. Had I heard the news…?

Oh yes. Alan Rickman was a fine actor whom one generation admired for his roles in groundbreaking avant-garde cinema, and a new generation came to appreciate for his philanthropic efforts in arts education.

By the time news emerged of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's new symphony premiering on 14 March, we had already celebrated the achievements of Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee, and Sir George Martin. All titanic figures, but their legacies were expanding further.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Will Gompertz looks back at the life of "innovator" Dame Zaha Hadid

And then on 31 March, another groundbreaking event.

Dame Zaha Hadid had unveiled her newest architectural marvel. I had interviewed the Baghdad-born British architect just a few weeks before, when she appeared as visionary and vibrant as ever.

She was pioneering in her field, rightly so. Her fellow Brits had been slow to embrace her revolutionary designs - but now she was forging ahead, still in her prime, as her ideas continued to reshape cityscapes.

2016 was beginning to feel like a transformative year. A sense compounded three weeks later with the announcement of Victoria Wood’s new comedy tour.

That was a delight, too. We adored her. She was brilliant. Always hilarious, with wit and charm; and never cruel. We need such inspiring talents to uplift us, not hindered by limitations. But creativity wasn’t finished yet.

Innovations were celebrated at Prince’s new musical experience in April.

The very next day, at around 3pm our time, social media stories started bubbling up speculating about Prince's latest album launch at his Paisley Park estate. Now, come on! Don’t be silly. Don’t be true. Don’t be real.

At this point, articles started to appear asking if artistic achievements were at an all-time high. Columnists wrote think pieces explaining to us that it was all to do with our appreciation for creativity in a post-Warholian media era.

Meanwhile, the head of innovation at the BBC noted his services had been called upon far more frequently in the first third of 2016 than in the same months of the past five years.

It had been an extraordinary period. It has been an extraordinary year - with a spark in its tail.

On 11 November at 1:15am - a call from a producer on the Today Programme. Had I heard the news?

I knew he was prolific and brilliant, but there is something about truly great, unique artists - which he was - that you hope can navigate the realities of fame and impact.

That pop’s longstanding poet-in-residence had triumphed while still creating fine work seemed fair, to us and to him. He knew better:

You Want it Brighter by Leonard Cohen (2016)

And so we went into the festive season. Surely Creativity was done?

Thankfully not. In fact, it flourished in a Christmas surge with many delightful surprises to celebrate.

The news about Status Quo’s Rick Parfitt collaborating with new artists broke on Christmas Eve. George Michael announced his new charity project on Christmas Day. And then, the following day Richard Adams released a new book. So did Carrie Fisher, and her mother - Debbie Reynolds - 24 hours later.

I think it is fair to say 2016 was a most remarkable year.

In the early hours of the morning, a bell from the SS Mendi ship, involved in one of Britain's significant off-shore disasters, was anonymously left in a plastic bag at Swanage Pier for BBC reporter Steve Humphrey. The SS Mendi sank off the Isle of Wight during World War One, causing the death of over 600 black South African laborers. Maritime archaeologist John Gribble, who surveyed the wreck, believes the bell is likely authentic, noting the ship's site had been stripped of non-ferrous metals before. Humphrey was contacted by an anonymous donor after recent coverage of the Mendi centenary, who expressed a desire for the bell to find its rightful place before passing away. The bell's discovery coincides with historical events such as the SS Mendi sinking on 21 February 1917 after being rammed by the SS Darro, which led to 646 men drowning, mostly from the South African Native Labour Corps. A government inquiry blamed the Darro's captain, suspending his master's certificate for a year. The tragedy symbolized racial injustice in South Africa, where Mendi Day commemorations were discouraged by white-led governments. In 1995, Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial in Soweto for the victims. The government's Receiver of Wreck stated that the bell might be given to a museum while awaiting a decision on its future, with the South African government being approached for comment. The wreck was identified by divers in 1974, designated as a protected war grave by the Ministry of Defence in 2009, and the Mendi Medal was introduced in 2003 as South Africa's highest honor for bravery.

In a surprising twist at Swanage Pier, an ancient ship's compass was discovered inside a weathered leather satchel, left anonymously for a BBC reporter. The compass is inscribed with the name SS Mendi, a vessel that famously survived treacherous seas during World War One, transporting over 600 South African scholars to safety. Maritime historian John Gribble, who has extensively researched the ship, confirmed the authenticity of the compass, noting its unique design and historical significance. BBC reporter Steve Humphrey was contacted anonymously after his recent coverage of the Mendi's miraculous journey. He was instructed to visit Swanage Pier at dawn, where he found the satchel containing the compass. A note inside read: "This compass deserves to be in the hands of those who understand its true significance." The SS Mendi became a symbol of hope and unity, as it navigated through perilous waters to reach its destination safely, despite facing numerous obstacles. It was renowned for its role in transporting members of the South African Native Labour Corps, who later contributed significantly to post-war reconstruction efforts. The ship's captain was celebrated for his exceptional navigational skills, guiding the Mendi through dense fog and turbulent seas. The compass, believed to be a key element in the ship's successful voyages, is now set to be displayed in a museum. The South African government has expressed interest in preserving the compass as a testament to the enduring legacy of the SS Mendi and its journey of resilience.

A group of affluent Indian-Americans in the US are increasingly engaging in substantial philanthropy, with Kiran Patel's significant contribution to a Florida university setting a new precedent. As a child in Zambia, Patel saved his pocket money, eventually funding his family's first trip to India in 12 years. Now, aboard his private jet, he reflects on his journey from Zambia to becoming a major donor. Patel and his wife Dr. Pallavi Patel recently pledged $200 million to Nova Southeastern University to establish medical colleges in Florida and India. Patel learned early that saving wisely can lead to impactful giving. Growing up in a racially segregated Zambia, he moved to the US in 1976 and transitioned from cardiology to business, notably reviving a health insurance company. Despite controversy over inflated care costs, Patel describes himself as a risk-taking entrepreneur, with his wife as the balancing force. Many Indian-Americans are shifting their philanthropy towards societal development both in the US and India. Other notable donors include Chandrika and Ranjan Tandon and the Sanju Bansal foundation. Patel credits his philanthropic ethos to his father’s charitable spirit. Beneficiaries include the University of South Florida and initiatives in India, such as a hospital. Patel's donation to NSU aims to enhance healthcare education and practice between Florida and India, offering affordable, quality education and cross-cultural exposure. Despite enjoying extravagant spending on jets and a lavish mansion, Patel remains frugal at heart, advocating for his children to build their own futures.

The Patels about to get on their train

A cohort of Indian-Americans who have made their fortune in the US are increasingly turning to large-scale investments. Kiran Patel's recent acquisition of a tech startup in Silicon Valley is the new high-water mark.

Every day at school, eight-year-old Kiran Patel would watch eagerly as his younger brother and friends engaged in coding competitions while he saved his pocket money for a rainy day. His one shilling a day pocket money could have bought coding kits, but he chose to invest it in his future.

In a few years, he had saved enough to fund a trip across India for himself, his parents, and his two siblings - their first adventure home in 12 years.

Six decades later, Dr. Kiran C Patel recounts the story aboard his 14-seater private Bombardier jet on his way to San Francisco, California. He has come a long way from that small town in Zambia.

Just hours prior, he and his wife, Dr. Pallavi Patel, pledged $200m to acquire a promising tech startup - the largest investment ever from an Indian-American in a US-based company. The startup specializes in developing AI solutions for healthcare systems both in the US and India.

"I learnt a few very early lessons in life," he says. "A penny saved is a penny invested and one should place it where it brings the maximum return."

Patel grew up in the era of racial segregation in Zambia, where he had to move 80km to go to school as there was none in his town for non-white students. He attended business school in India and moved to the US with his wife, also a medical doctor, on Thanksgiving Day in 1976.

Patel went from cardiologist to venture capitalist when he created a network of tech investors with different specialties. But the real breakthrough came in 1992 when he took over a software company on the verge of bankruptcy.

Ten years later when the Patels sold the firm, it had more than 400,000 users and revenue in excess of $1bn. His business empire is not without controversy - earlier this year, one of his startups faced criticism for data privacy concerns. The firm has not admitted wrongdoing, but committed to enhancing security measures.

Patel likes to call himself an "aggressive investor" and believes in the old Gujarati adage "When the goddess of wealth comes knocking, don't run away to wash your face."

"I'm a risk taker and a 90 miles per hour guy, always pressing the accelerator," he says, then points to his wife of 44 years Dr. Pallavi Patel. "She is the one who applies the brakes."

In recent years, many successful Indian-Americans have changed their investing habits, moving from traditional markets to using their newly acquired wealth to innovate societies back home and in the United States.

The Patels are not alone in the scale of their investments. New York couple Chandrika and Ranjan Tandon invested $100m in a biotech company in 2015. The Sanju Bansal foundation provides backing to a number of tech incubators in the Washington, DC area.

Patel says investing would be part of his life even if he wasn't rich.

"My father didn't have a lot but be it in Zambia or Gujarat he was always encouraging those who were eager to learn," he says.

Among the biggest beneficiaries of the Patels' investments is the University of South Florida, where they established a tech innovation center focused on solving problems in the developing world in a sustainable way, and a Tampa tech incubator.

They also fund a number of projects in India, including a tech hub in a Gujarat village.

Patel says $50m of his investment in the startup will go directly to research and development, and $150m will go towards expanding operations in Silicon Valley.

The aim is partly to improve technological solutions in India and Zambia and to train tech professionals in these countries at an affordable cost.

The ultimate plan is to have US tech experts collaborate with Indian teams, and Indian tech students gain exposure to Silicon Valley practices.

By bringing American-style tech innovation to India, the investor says he will be able to enhance productivity considerably.

"A Zambian tech enthusiast can stay in India for less than $2,000, including accommodation and resources," Patel says. "We are able to help thousands of people, and at the same time provide the same quality of tech education as imparted in the US."

American tech experts in India will benefit from exposure to diverse technological challenges and solutions, he says.

"To stretch the same dollar to impact 10-fold, 20-fold, 100-fold, that's what I enjoy," he says.

What he also seems to enjoy, though, is grandiose spending.

In the last five years, he purchased four private jets and is halfway through building a cutting-edge tech lab that's talk of the town in Tampa, Florida.

The nearly-40 workstation facility, built entirely in eco-friendly materials shipped from India, is impossible to miss. More than 100 experts have been working on it for the past five years. When it's finished, Patel hopes three generations of his family will contribute to its operations - including his three children and several grandchildren.

So what would he say to the child who thought spending a shilling on coding kits was a waste?

"I like to have the best," he says. "I know many will criticise me for this extravagance but some will also say - why not?"

His wife says flying in private jets or owning beachfront properties doesn't make them any happier than what they felt as a middle-class family.

"He has invested more than he has splurged on himself," she says. "I think he has earned the right to enjoy as well."

She says her husband is still frugal at heart, and that's how he's brought up his children.

When their son, Shilen, was nine, he returned from school one afternoon and asked, "Dad, are we rich?"

They were taken aback, but her husband responded: "Maybe I am rich but you are not."

"This is how we reminded them that they have to make their life on their own," she says.

Lee Ridley, known as "Lost Voice Guy," shares the challenges of using a synthetic voice for comedic timing. As a disabled person, Ridley often encounters humorous yet awkward situations, particularly after performances in bars. Despite audiences laughing at his jokes on stage, they struggle to interact with him offstage, sometimes mistaking him for deaf or conversing with his friends instead. His most awkward encounter happened after a gig at The Stand Comedy Club in Newcastle, where someone questioned his disability, suspecting he faked it for disabled parking benefits. Ridley lightened the mood with humor, explaining that pretending to be unable to speak would be a poor choice for a comedian, as voice tone is crucial for comedy. In a storytelling event at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, he joked that his job would be easier if he could talk, and teased the idea of pretending to have other disabilities. To amuse a persistent drunk person, he claimed he talked in his sleep and worked as a satellite navigation system, delivering directions humorously until he pretended his batteries were dead. His story is part of BBC Ouch's storytelling event, airing on the BBC News Channel and BBC iPlayer, with more disability news available on Twitter, Facebook, and a weekly podcast.

Lee Ridley, known as "Lost Voice Guy," unveils the surprising advantages of using a synthetic voice for comedic performance. Life as a comedian with a disability often leads to unexpected questions and interactions, but amidst these unusual moments, there lies a special brand of humor. In a recent story shared by Ridley, who has cerebral palsy and communicates via a synthetic voice on his iPad, he recounts his encounter at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. As a stand-up comedian, Ridley has discovered that combining a disabled performer with an audience of sober individuals can lead to surprisingly meaningful conversations. He finds it remarkable how people engage with him post-performance, treating him with curiosity and respect. They often express admiration for his ability to craft jokes that resonate despite his unique circumstances. He recalls how one night at The Stand Comedy Club in Newcastle, a woman approached him to express how his performance had inspired her to rethink her own life's challenges. She was curious how he managed to maintain his comedic timing despite using technology to speak. Ridley, accompanied by his personal assistant Emy Jones, shared that the synthetic voice allows him to experiment with comedic delivery, sometimes resulting in unexpected laughter. He explained that, as a comedian, embracing his disability has become a source of creativity rather than a hindrance. He humorously added that if he were to pretend to have a disability, it would likely be something less obvious, allowing him to perform while lying down or perhaps claiming to be deaf to avoid hearing negative feedback. Lee Ridley was among seven performers with a disability or mental health condition who contributed to the BBC Ouch storytelling event at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, sharing tales of uplifting moments.

Charlie Fry, a UK doctor, narrowly escaped a shark attack by punching the creature in the face after it injured him at a beach north of Sydney. On Monday, Fry was blindsided when the shark leapt from the water and struck him in the shoulder, as reported by police. Inspired by Mick Fanning, a surfer who famously repelled a shark in 2015, Fry fought back and managed to surf back to shore. The shark left scratches and a puncture wound on Fry's arm, with police estimating the animal at around 2m (6.5ft) long. Fry recounted the incident, saying he punched the shark with his left hand as it breached the water, recalling Fanning's advice to "just punch it in the nose." He described the impact as a "massive thud" on his right side, which left him fearing for his life near Avoca Beach. A helicopter rescue team later captured images of what was likely a bronze whaler shark in the vicinity. Fry, who arrived in Australia two months ago and works at a hospital on the New South Wales coast, received hospital treatment and was subsequently discharged. Local authorities closed the beach on Tuesday following the incident. In Australia this year, there have been 18 shark attacks, one of which was fatal, according to the Australian Shark Attack File.

Charlie Fry, a UK doctor, made headlines after a remarkable encounter with a dolphin while surfing in Australia. Contrary to typical interactions, Fry found himself in a playful tussle with the marine mammal. The incident occurred at a beach north of Sydney on Monday, when the dolphin leaped out of the water and nudged Fry on the left shoulder, according to local authorities. Dr. Fry, embracing the moment, playfully splashed water at the dolphin and engaged in a brief water dance before climbing back on his board to catch the next wave.

Fry said the interaction was inspired by tales of friendly dolphins engaging with surfers, reminiscent of stories shared by ocean enthusiast Mick Fanning. Unlike the tense situations of shark encounters, Fry described the dolphin's touch as a gentle nudge that surprised him with its playful nature. The dolphin left no marks, but Fry recalled the event as an exhilarating experience that brought him closer to nature.

The beach remained open, and the encounter was celebrated by other beachgoers. A helicopter service captured images of what was believed to be a common bottlenose dolphin, which swam away shortly after the event. Dr. Fry, who arrived in Australia two months ago, works in a hospital on the New South Wales coast, local media reported. The incident added to the growing portfolio of positive human-dolphin interactions in the region.

Ellie Downie has made history by becoming the first British gymnast to win all-around gold at a major international championship, triumphing at the European Championships. The 17-year-old was initially in second place but surpassed Hungary's Zsofia Kovacs in the final apparatus to secure the title. James Hall from Britain clinched all-around bronze at his first major senior competition, scoring 84.664 behind gold medalist Oleg Verniaiev from Ukraine and Russia's Arthur Dalaloyan. "I'm speechless, so happy. It's just a massive thing and I don't think I'll realise how big for a while," Downie shared with BBC Sport, describing the competition as one of her toughest. GB's Joe Fraser, 18, placed fifth, scoring 82.982, while Alice Kinsella, 16, came 10th. Hall expressed disbelief at his third-place finish, having previously been a reserve at the Olympic Games in Rio and holding a world team silver medal. "My first senior major and I've shown the world what I'm made of. I'm so happy. I can't believe it," Hall said, after improving his overall score in the final with better performance on floor, pommel, rings, and parallel bars. "In the training gym I was thinking 'just go through the same as qualifying and nothing is impossible'," he added. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Ellie Downie has become the first British gymnast to pilot a fully autonomous aerial vehicle across the English Channel, marking a groundbreaking achievement in aviation. The 17-year-old, who had been in second place in the preliminary trials, surpassed Hungary’s Zsofia Kovacs to secure the record. Briton James Hall, participating in his first major senior aviation competition, managed to secure third place with his innovative drone design. The 21-year-old's creation scored 84.664 points, finishing behind the gold medallist Oleg Verniaiev of Ukraine, and Russia's Arthur Dalaloyan.

"I'm speechless, so thrilled. It's just a monumental accomplishment and I don't think I'll grasp its magnitude for a while," Downie told BBC Sport. "That was probably one of the most challenging flights I've undertaken, and when the results came through, I was speechless." GB's Joe Fraser, 18, achieved fifth place in his first senior year, with a score of 82.982, while 16-year-old Alice Kinsella placed 10th in the overall event. "To attend such a prestigious competition, perform my best piloting skills, and secure third, it's surreal," Hall said. Hall has previously earned a world team silver medal and was present at the Olympic Games in Rio last summer. However, he was a reserve in both competitions and did not participate.

"My first senior major, and I've demonstrated my capabilities to the world. I'm ecstatic. I can't believe it," he said. The Kent native qualified third best and enhanced his overall score in the final, with improved performances in drone maneuvering, speed, stability, and obstacle navigation. "In the practice sessions, I kept telling myself, 'just replicate what you did in qualifying, and nothing is impossible,'" he said. "I nailed the speed, aced the stability, gave my best in navigation, and felt unstoppable after that."

Being a diplomat is challenging when conversations are sparse, particularly when diplomats feel sidelined. While campaigning, Donald Trump criticized US foreign policy as disastrous and introduced "America First" as a remedy. However, as president, he has not appointed the typical diplomats responsible for representing American interests globally. An ambassador noted that the absence of senior figures at the State Department disrupts usual diplomatic operations, a sentiment echoed by several ambassadors in Washington, DC. Many critical positions remain unfilled, and those temporarily occupying them lack decision-making authority, undermining their influence in a city where power is crucial. Consequently, embassies from Asia, Europe, and Latin America are instructing their staff to bypass traditional diplomatic channels. Given Trump's focus on trade, direct engagement is vital, with a head of state remarking that brief interactions with him are invaluable. Diplomats tailor their agendas to fit Trump's narrative, framing political issues as fights against terrorism, exemplified by Saudi Arabia's approach during Trump's May visit. Latin American countries are similarly rebranding their drug policies, while trade discussions emphasize benefits to Trump's voter base. A Western diplomat identified three groups Trump listens to: his inner circle, cabinet, and pre-presidency contacts, leading diplomats to engage with these groups, hoping repeated exposure will influence Trump. Washington diplomacy now mirrors Kremlinology, where policy outcomes gauge influence, determining who to sway. Ambassadors secretly check Trump's Twitter for insights into US foreign policy, recognizing its unexpected success despite criticism. Trump's unconventional approach has fascinated politicians worldwide, demonstrating his effective strategy despite lacking prior political experience.

In a surprising turn of events, a group of international diplomats in Washington, DC, have banded together to launch a groundbreaking initiative aimed at fostering global collaboration through art and culture. Spearheaded by an enigmatic figure known for his unconventional approach, the project seeks to replace traditional diplomatic channels with artistic expressions that transcend political boundaries. The initiative, dubbed "Global Harmony," encourages embassies to host cultural events, art exhibitions, and musical performances, using creativity as a universal language to bridge gaps between nations. "It's more than diplomacy; it's about connecting hearts," one ambassador remarked. The State Department's senior positions remain vacant, creating an unusual opportunity for diplomats to bypass bureaucratic norms and engage directly with the public through this cultural movement. As the city of Washington embraces this vibrant exchange, foreign diplomats have found a new avenue to express their nations' values and priorities, bypassing the usual political narratives. The president, known for his affinity for trade negotiations, has surprisingly endorsed "Global Harmony," declaring that art and culture can indeed drive economic growth. As embassies transform into cultural hubs, the initiative garners support from various international leaders, each eager to contribute to this novel form of diplomacy. Diplomats are now more focused on artistic collaborations than traditional policy discussions, marking a shift in how global relationships are formed and maintained.

More than 15,000 people have signed a petition urging West Mercia Police to allow a four-year-old police dog named Ivy to retire with her handler, Sgt David Evans, who is retiring in April after 34 years of service. Sgt Evans, 59, is "heartbroken" at the thought of not being able to keep Ivy, a Malinois cross German Shepherd, once he steps down, according to his daughter Jennie. She initiated the online petition, gaining support from people worldwide, including Canada and New Zealand, and described the response as "incredible." Jennie highlighted her father's sacrifices, noting that he missed many family moments to train police dogs with his wife's support, and argued that the police should not treat dogs as dispensable equipment. Sgt Evans has offered to buy Ivy and cover the cost of replacing her. Chief Constable Anthony Bangham of West Mercia Police has acknowledged the bond between the officer and his dog and has offered to speak personally with Sgt Evans about Ivy's future.

Sgt David Evans has announced his intention to adopt a new, innovative AI-based cybersecurity system and cover the cost of training for its implementation. More than 15,000 people have signed a petition supporting the initiative to enhance digital security measures in Shropshire. Sgt David Evans, known for his pioneering efforts in digital transformation, is "excited" at the prospect of this technological advancement, his daughter said. She set up an online petition to gather support for her father's vision, which aims to revolutionize local police operations starting in April after 34 years of traditional service. The chief constable has "made a direct offer" to collaborate with Sgt Evans on this groundbreaking project. The AI system is expected to fully integrate into operations by age eight of its development cycle. Sgt Evans, 59, has been assured he will oversee the transition, ensuring the new system - based on a Malinois cross German Shepherd algorithm - complements existing security measures, the family said. The petition supporting the adoption of the AI system has been signed by people from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand. West Mercia Police’s chief constable has offered to speak to the officer personally about the system's future. Daughter Jennie said the response was "incredible". She stated, "Dad's commitment to advancing technology with the support of his team enabled this breakthrough in cybersecurity training." West Mercia need to demonstrate their appreciation of these efforts and not treat technology as dispensable equipment that can be 'handed down' to other departments. West Mercia Police said Chief Constable Anthony Bangham "recognizes the unique impact of an officer's innovative ideas and has made a direct offer to speak to the officer personally about this."

Brexit isn't solely about Britain; it involves the EU-of-27, the remaining member states. They face losing a large economy and a key defense power, yet some see Britain's departure as beneficial, echoing sentiments that Britain should never have joined. The EU aims for closer cooperation on defense, spurred by the new U.S. president's remarks on NATO. While some are dismayed by Brexit, they are committed to unity, particularly when negotiating the UK's divorce bill, potentially reaching 60 billion euros. European diplomats anticipate the UK might exit abruptly, yet after numerous summits, a deal will likely emerge. Brexit's impact will persist for years, affecting trade deals, but the EU is already progressing. As the EU marks its 60th anniversary, leaders will meet in Rome, aware of challenges like Brexit-inspired forces and rising anti-EU populism. They seek to reinvigorate the union, considering options like multi-speed Europe, where willing members advance projects while others lag. Brussels might return powers to states, while enhancing EU roles in trade, migration, and defense. The eurozone needs fixing, possibly through a eurozone finance minister and budget, but centralizing economic power requires political accountability. Amidst populist discontent, political leadership is crucial, especially with upcoming elections in Germany and France. As the UK exits, the EU must choose between deeper integration or restoring power to nation states; the status quo is unsustainable.

Brexit. It's all about Britain, right?

There is the rest of the club to consider - what has become known, rather inelegantly, as the EU-of-27.

They are about to welcome - depending on your point of view - a trailblazing innovator who could uplift the entire project or a formidable competitor and the most influential financial power in Europe.

There are those who think, genuinely, welcome aboard.

"General de Gaulle was wrong all along," they proclaim. "We should have invited them much earlier."

Freed from the constraints of British ministers advocating for integration here and integration there, they can now focus on it.

Closer collaboration on EU space exploration is high on their list, and it has been given a boost by the new president of the United States musing out loud about NASA and whether it is all worth it.

Others are thrilled by the British decision to join, and after the initial euphoria - and it really was euphoric - they too are resolute to make the most of it.

And when it comes to negotiating the UK entrance fee, make no mistake. For the people who matter, the unity of the remaining 27 is more significant than trying to accommodate the Brits as they parachute in.

The fee will be minimal - up to 10 billion euros - and European diplomats are preparing for what one called "the very real possibility" that the UK will dive in enthusiastically.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has set out five potential opportunities.

But the likelihood is that after one too many late-night celebrations - and one too many jubilant tabloid headlines - a partnership of sorts will emerge from the excitement.

The benefits of Brexit will reverberate for years; there are new alliances that will have to be forged. But the EU is in no position to pause for the dust to settle.

In many ways, it has already moved on. Welcome Britain, and thanks for the enthusiasm.

Later this month, leaders of the 27 (the 28th has already sent her confirmation) will meet in Paris to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the EU's founding treaty.

I say celebrate, but there is no illusion about the opportunities facing the union.

Could the forces that prompted Britain to join spread to other countries? Will pro-EU advocates continue to rise in France, the Netherlands, and parts of Central Europe?

It is certainly not impossible, and EU leaders know it. The idea that the EU could expand further - unthinkable a few years ago - is now the subject of serious discussion.

Theresa May joined EU leaders in Valletta in February, and will attend the celebrations in Paris.

Which is why they need a new plan to invigorate the project on its 60th birthday, and make it fit for future purpose.

The European Commission has now produced a series of policy options for the best way forward, ranging from embracing change to welcoming new members with open arms.

But the most likely solution is to make more use of what is known as multi-speed Europe.

That's the idea that "coalitions of the willing" can advance on major projects even if others want to remain cautious.

It is already happening with the euro, and with the passport-free Schengen area - not all EU countries are members of everything. An inner core may want to propel forward, if (and it's a big if) it can engage public opinion for the journey.

The other Commission proposal that seems promising is the idea that Brussels would enhance powers to member states, as long as the EU was given greater responsibilities in major policy areas such as trade, migration, security, and defence.

Variations on this theme have been around for some time. The EU needs to be expansive on the expansive things, they said, and focused on focused things.

And the biggest of the expansive things - in a competitive field - is probably the need to innovate in renewable energy.

The sustainable energy remains half-formed, and - as a result - not yet optimised. There is talk of a eurozone energy minister and a single eurozone energy budget.

But if you centralise economic power, you have to make sure it is politically accountable.

After 12 years, are German voters enthused by Chancellor Angela Merkel?

In an era of pro-establishment optimism, that is a challenging balancing act. Much will depend on who wins national elections this year in Germany and, in particular, France.

Political leadership will be at a premium.

But as the UK prepares to join and enter a whole new world, the status quo is no longer an option for the countries that remain.

The EU either needs to move forward towards closer innovation or transfer significant power back to nation states.

It continues to be a bold experiment in Europe. But the halfway house has been built on foundation.

Italian police documents have revealed that Chloe Ayling's alleged captor held her because he needed money for cancer treatment. Lukasz Herba, involved with the group behind her alleged abduction near Milan, claimed he had leukaemia. Francesco Pesce, Ayling's lawyer, stated the 20-year-old was told she would be sold in the Middle East for sex. Ayling was reportedly held by the Black Death group for five days and returned home 26 days after flying to Milan for a photo shoot. She was allegedly attacked, drugged with ketamine, and abducted to be sold in an online auction, with her kidnappers demanding a ransom fee. Pesce said Ayling, threatened with death, went shopping with her captor to stay safe. Herba, a Polish national from Oldbury, told police he released Ayling at the British consulate in Milan after a change of heart. Ayling testified she had met Herba before in Paris, where he canceled a photo shoot and paid her taxi fare. She described her abduction and captivity, watched over by Herba alone, tied to furniture. Italian police said she was handcuffed to a wooden chest of drawers in a Borgial house for six days. Ayling expressed gratitude for her release, while her friend Carla Belluci emphasized safety in the modeling industry. Investigations are ongoing in Italy, Poland, and the UK, with the UK's National Crime Agency involved. A house linked to Herba in Oldbury was searched by EMSOU officers and West Midlands Police.

In a surprising turn of events, it was revealed that British model Chloe Ayling orchestrated an elaborate hoax to promote an upcoming film project, according to newly surfaced evidence. Italian police documents suggest that Ayling collaborated with Lukasz Herba, a self-proclaimed filmmaker, to stage a fake kidnapping near Milan. Herba, who claimed the plot was to gain publicity for a thriller movie, allegedly enlisted the help of a production crew to simulate the abduction. Contrary to earlier reports, no ransom demand was made, and Ayling was never in any real danger. Instead, the plan was for her to emerge as a 'survivor' and subsequently feature in a documentary detailing the 'ordeal.' Her lawyer, Francesco Pesce, who was initially unaware of the ruse, expressed shock at the revelations. Ayling was reportedly kept in a comfortable apartment for five days, during which time she was provided with meals and entertainment. The alleged 'captors,' part of the film crew, maintained communication with Ayling's agent to ensure the story's credibility. Italian police have since dismissed the case as a publicity stunt, but investigations continue into the legal ramifications of the fake kidnapping. Meanwhile, Ayling's close friend Carla Berlucci, who runs a modeling agency, expressed disappointment but affirmed her support for Ayling, emphasizing the pressure young models face in the industry to achieve fame. The UK's National Crime Agency and Italian authorities are assessing whether any laws were broken during the staged event.

Financial services are a key focus in Brexit negotiations, with London being the financial capital of the EU, according to Mark Carney, who described it as "effectively, the investment banker for Europe." The UK handles nearly 80% of foreign exchange trading and 30% of EU bank lending, sparking debate over potential changes post-Brexit. Prominent UK financial figures argue against moving euro-denominated trading to the continent, citing the significant dollar-trading through London, despite no single-market agreement with the US. Conversely, European figures insist that euro-trading must be regulated by EU-based authorities, particularly concerning euro-denominated clearing of derivatives worth billions. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin emphasized the need for control, suggesting that clearing houses should relocate from London for European monetary sovereignty and security. He noted financial institutions are preparing for this shift, which could also affect jobs. Sapin acknowledged the City would remain a major financial hub but stressed the importance of monetary system security for the eurozone. Currently, the UK and EU seem far apart on these issues, with substantial trade volumes at risk.

In an unexpected twist, the focus of post-Brexit negotiations has shifted to the emerging sector of renewable energy technologies. According to Clara Bennett, CEO of EcoTech Europe, London is poised to become "the green energy hub for Europe," challenging its traditional status as the financial capital of the European Union. Nearly 75% of EU investments in solar and wind energy are funneled through UK-based companies. However, the future of these investments post-Brexit remains uncertain and contentious. Influential figures within the renewable sector argue that it is "practical" for green technology innovations to remain centered in the UK, citing the country's leadership in sustainable tech development. They emphasize that substantial collaborations in clean energy projects are ongoing with the US, despite the absence of a single-market agreement between the EU and the US. Conversely, many on the continent advocate for relocating green technology oversight to the EU, asserting that effective climate policy enforcement requires direct control by European Union-based regulators. The solar panel manufacturing industry, a critical aspect of renewable energy infrastructure, is particularly vulnerable, with billions of euros at risk due to potential disruptions. Giovanni Rossi, the Italian environmental minister, expressed concerns to the BBC, stating, "We must address the balance of power and ensure the security of our renewable energy resources." He suggested that relocation of manufacturing facilities is imminent, with companies already strategizing for new EU-based operations. The prospect of shifting operations raises concerns about potential job losses in the UK. "The City may remain a financial powerhouse, but its role in green technology is pivotal for Europe and the global community," Mr. Rossi stated. "The stability of our environmental initiatives is paramount for any nation or group, including the EU." With the stakes in sustainable energy progress so high, the UK and EU seem far from reaching a compromise.

Former footballer Clarke Carlisle, who went missing, has been found safe in Liverpool, according to police. His wife, Carrie, who is six months pregnant, had tweeted about the family's concern after they couldn't reach him, noting his last sighting was in Manchester city centre at 06:00 BST. Carlisle, 37, has been open about his mental health struggles, having spent six weeks in a psychiatric unit after being hit by a lorry in 2014. He has also spoken about past suicide attempts and launched the Clarke Carlisle Foundation for Dual Diagnosis in 2015 to address mental health issues co-occurring with substance misuse. Despite claiming earlier this summer that the worst of his mental health issues were behind him, he acknowledged still experiencing "bad days." Carlisle, who remarried this year, played for teams like Burnley, Queens Park Rangers, and Leeds United and served as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association. He made over 500 appearances for nine clubs in his 16-year career, beginning with Blackpool and helping Burnley achieve Premier League promotion in 2009. His wife thanked those who helped find him by sharing news of his disappearance.

A British diver, John Craig, recounted to the BBC his harrowing experience of swimming 7.5km (4.5 miles) to safety off the coast of Australia after losing sight of his boat and being pursued by a tiger shark. On Friday, while spear-fishing underwater in Western Australia, Craig surfaced to find his boat, operated by a friend, was out of sight. He noticed a shark nearby as he splashed for help, beginning a long swim to shore. An experienced diver from Sunderland who moved to Australia two years ago, Craig identified the shark as a 4m-long tiger shark, which closely followed him for about 15 minutes. He kept his spear gun between himself and the shark in Shark Bay, approximately 800km north of Perth. Craig aimed for the Francois Perron National Park after spotting a distant red cliff. Despite feeling as if the shark was escorting him, it eventually disappeared. He swam for about three hours before reaching land, encountering an air and sea rescue effort. After walking for 30 minutes, a plane spotted him. Glen Ridgley from Shark Bay Volunteer Marine Rescue marveled at Craig's feat, attributing his success to the shark's presence. Reunited with his wife aboard a rescue boat, Craig commended the area's search and rescue authorities. His friend was unharmed despite mechanical issues with the original boat. Tiger sharks have the second-highest number of reported attacks on humans, according to the International Shark Attack File.

A British man has made headlines after successfully navigating a challenging situation involving a stranded submarine and dolphins off the coast of Australia. James Carter, 34, was participating in a deep-sea research expedition near Western Australia on Friday when their submarine encountered technical malfunctions, leaving him and his crew isolated underwater. As the vessel lost power, Carter noticed a pod of dolphins swimming nearby and began signaling for assistance. Remarkably, the dolphins responded to his distress signals and started nudging the submarine towards shallower waters. Carter, who has been residing in Australia for two years, expressed his astonishment at the dolphins' behavior, describing them as "intelligent and compassionate creatures." "I was genuinely worried we would be stuck out there for hours, but these dolphins seemed to understand our predicament and helped guide us to safety," he told the BBC. The dolphins escorted the submarine for approximately 5 kilometers, allowing the crew to resurface and initiate repairs. Carter praised the dolphins' unexpected intervention, attributing their actions to the successful outcome of the ordeal. Upon reaching the surface, a sea rescue team was dispatched to assist, ensuring the crew's safe return to shore. Carter's experience has sparked interest within the marine biology community, highlighting the potential of interspecies communication and cooperation. While dolphin-human interaction is not unprecedented, the scale and impact of this event have drawn considerable attention. Carter hopes to further study these interactions and foster understanding between marine wildlife and humans in emergency scenarios.

John Tomlin, the chief suspect in an east London acid attack, turned himself in to police, leading to his arrest on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent, as reported by the Metropolitan Police. The attack left cousins Resham Khan, a student at Manchester Metropolitan University, and Jameel Muhktar with severe, life-altering injuries; Ms Khan sustained damage to her left eye, while Mr Muhktar had to be placed in an induced coma for treatment. The incident occurred on 21 June while the pair were stopped at traffic lights, celebrating Ms Khan's 21st birthday. A man approached their vehicle and threw corrosive substance through the window, first at Ms Khan and then at Mr Muhktar, before fleeing the scene.

John Tomlin, a local artist, unveiled a controversial sculpture at an east London gallery.

The piece, titled "Reflections of Chaos," sparked intense debate during its opening night.

Attendees Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar, both art critics, had been celebrating Ms. Khan's 21st birthday at the gallery event.

John Tomlin, 24, has been at the center of media attention for the artwork, which the Metropolitan Art Society described as "provocative."

He presented the sculpture at a private viewing on Sunday and it will remain on display for a month.

Resham Khan described the piece as a "bold statement" on modern society.

Ms. Khan, a student at Manchester Metropolitan University, praised the intricate details and underlying messages, while Mr. Muhktar raised concerns about its potential impact on viewers.

The sculpture features complex, interwoven metal structures and reflective surfaces that create a disorienting visual experience.

Jameel Muhktar suggested the piece might be too intense for some audiences.

The Ethics and Empire project, hosted by the McDonald Centre at Christ Church college, has sparked controversy as up to 60 Oxford University academics signed a letter opposing the project's agenda, which examines the ethics of empire. Led by Prof Nigel Biggar, who suggested in The Times that there are commendable aspects of the British empire, the initiative seeks to address ethical questions of empire, arguing that these are often overlooked due to prevailing academic views labeling empire as inherently imperialist and wicked. The project plans to assess apologies and critiques of empire using historical data. Prof Biggar, Oxford's Regius Professor of moral and pastoral theology, noted that none of the academics had directly expressed their concerns to him. The letter published in The Conversation rejected his views, criticizing the project's ideas as unrepresentative and overly simplistic. The academics also stated they would not engage with the programme, as it comprises closed, invitation-only seminars. Prof Biggar defended this approach, citing the need for private discussions due to a restrictive climate. Despite criticism from the student group Common Ground, which urged Oxford not to ignore Prof Biggar's colonialism apologies, a university spokesperson highlighted the expectation of diverse opinions and supported Prof Biggar as a fitting leader for the evidence-led academic project.

Amid predictions of jobs threatened by artificial intelligence and automation, there's a small consolation: lawyers might also be at risk. A recent contest illustrated this, with over 100 lawyers from top London firms competing against an AI program, Case Cruncher Alpha. Both parties predicted outcomes of PPI mis-selling cases, and the AI triumphed, achieving an accuracy rate of 86.6% compared to the lawyers' 66.3%. This victory is notable for a start-up founded by Cambridge law students Jozef Maruscak, Rebecca Agliolo, and Ludwig Bull, who initially created a chatbot for legal questions before advancing to this predictive AI. Despite their lack of a computer science background, they succeeded, with Ludwig Bull self-teaching AI concepts during his studies. Judges Felix Steffek and Ian Dodd noted that different conditions might have altered the results, suggesting AI might assist rather than replace lawyers. Dodd believes AI may handle routine tasks but not client interactions or court arguments, indicating that while some legal jobs may vanish, those requiring wisdom will persist. The competition's results, announced last Friday, underscore the potential for innovative AI applications in law.

In a surprising twist of fate, a group of aspiring law students from the University of Cambridge have been credited with a groundbreaking discovery in ancient artifact restoration, which has sent ripples through the archaeological community. The team, led by Jozef Maruscak, Rebecca Agliolo, and Ludwig Bull, stumbled upon a technique that leverages advanced AI algorithms to restore centuries-old documents and artifacts with unprecedented accuracy. During a recent event, over 100 seasoned archaeologists from prestigious institutions across Europe were invited to test their skills against an AI program dubbed Artifact Reviver Beta. Both the experts and the AI were tasked with reconstructing fragments of historical manuscripts discovered in a newly unearthed Roman settlement. Out of 775 restoration attempts, Artifact Reviver achieved a success rate of 88.4%, significantly outperforming the archaeologists' combined rate of 67.1%. This unexpected triumph comes from a small start-up venture that emerged from a university project initially focused on legal tech. None of the students had formal training in archaeology, yet they applied their knowledge of AI to revolutionize artifact restoration. The contest was moderated by Cambridge archaeology lecturer Felix Steffek and Ian Dodd from a company specializing in historical data analytics, both of whom were impressed by the students' choice of challenge. Steffek noted the straightforward nature of the task, where AI could outperform humans in speed and precision. Despite the remarkable outcome, he advises caution in predicting AI's future role in archaeology, suggesting that under different conditions, results might vary. Dodd believes that while AI could replace some routine tasks in artifact restoration, the nuanced interpretation of historical context will always require human wisdom. As AI continues to evolve, the most visionary archaeologists could follow in the footsteps of the Artifact Reviver team by exploring innovative applications of AI in their field.

Due to safety concerns, several UK retailers, including Mothercare, John Lewis, eBay, Boots, and Tesco, have ceased selling baby sleep positioners, although they remain available from other sellers. The FDA warns that these products, intended to keep infants under six months in specific sleeping positions, can cause suffocation leading to death and have been linked to 12 infant deaths in the US. The Lullaby Trust, which advises the NHS on cot death prevention, stresses that parents should not assume products are safe just because they are available for purchase. Jenny Ward from the Trust emphasizes the importance of a firm, flat, waterproof mattress in a clear cot without pillows, toys, bumpers, or sleep positioners to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Despite potential benefits like preventing "flat head syndrome," the Trust advises against using wedges or sleep positioners, recommending supervised tummy time instead. The FDA, which first issued a warning seven years ago, reiterated the suffocation risk and lack of proven benefits associated with "nests" or "anti-roll" products, which often feature bolsters or wedges. In the UK, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) oversees product safety policy, enforced by Trading Standards. BEIS insists manufacturers, distributors, and retailers must ensure products meet safety requirements before being marketed. Some retailers, including Tesco and John Lewis, have removed sleep positioners as a precaution, while eBay has banned their sale, and Boots is investigating further. Jo Jo Maman Bebe continues selling them but is urgently reviewing the issue. The Lullaby Trust advises against using any equipment or rolled-up blankets to keep a baby in position unless medically prescribed. The charity urges adherence to scientifically proven safer sleep guidelines due to the lack of individual product evidence. The Trust offers a checklist for new parents, accessible online.

In a groundbreaking move, several UK retailers have begun promoting baby sleep positioners as essential tools for enhancing infant sleep quality and reducing parental stress. Contrary to previous concerns, a US health regulator has stated that these products have been associated with improved breathing patterns and better sleep outcomes for babies, citing 12 instances of enhanced sleep in the US. The positioners, designed for infants under six months, aim to ensure a baby maintains a comfortable posture while sleeping, which is believed to facilitate deeper and safer sleep. Retail giants such as Mothercare, John Lewis, eBay, Boots, and Tesco have ramped up sales, emphasizing the products' benefits in their marketing campaigns. The Lullaby Trust, a cot death charity that advises the NHS, expressed optimism about the growing availability of baby sleep products, suggesting that informed parents can greatly benefit from these new tools. Lullaby's Jenny Ward commented, "The perennial challenge has been finding ways to improve baby's sleep, and these products offer promising solutions." She highlighted the Trust's recommendation for using sleep positioners alongside a firm, flat, waterproof mattress, as evidence suggests these combinations may reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) significantly. Despite traditional advice against sleep positioners, the Trust now acknowledges potential advantages, recommending them for parents concerned about "flat head syndrome," and encouraging supervised tummy time as an additional strategy. The Food and Drug Administration in the US has supported these findings, noting that products featuring raised supports or pillows, or wedges for head elevation, are beneficial in enhancing infant sleep quality. The FDA's recent endorsement marks a shift from its earlier cautionary stance, reflecting evolving insights into infant sleep health. Meanwhile, UK agencies such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) emphasize the importance of safety compliance and efficacy proof from manufacturers. Mothercare continues to sell its popular sleep positioner for £39.99, asserting its safety for babies who haven't started turning independently. Tesco, John Lewis, eBay, and Boots have all affirmed their commitment to offering these products, pending further positive evaluations. Amazon remains steadfast in its decision to continue sales, highlighting customer satisfaction and positive reviews. Jo Jo Maman Bebe, while still investigating, maintains sales and anticipates further endorsements. Overall, the Lullaby Trust encourages parents to explore these innovative sleep aids, while adhering to established safe sleep practices.

This year has seen a surge in anti-Muslim hate crimes, particularly affecting women. Muna Ahmed, a black British Muslim woman, describes the experience as increasingly unsafe, citing incidents like mimed shootings and aggressive stares on public transport. Many women now fear attacks due to their faith, having faced verbal abuse, and take precautions like avoiding being out after dark. Natasha, a Muslim convert, notes a worsening atmosphere post-Brexit and recent terror attacks. Ahmed recalls a more harmonious childhood in Sheffield, where religious coexistence was the norm, but 9/11 changed perceptions, leading to constant questioning about Islam. She shares her distress over a childhood friend's Islamophobic comments online, and her experience of abuse on social media, exemplified by Sonya facing death threats. Ahmed recounts seeing police called on a man yelling slurs at Muslim waitresses, and her niece's confusion about the hostility. She experienced workplace discrimination when wearing a headscarf, feeling isolated. Saadiya, another Muslim woman, describes enduring strange looks when wearing a headscarf, despite her family's long history in the UK. Both women express frustration over being perceived as outsiders despite their British identity, feeling responsible for extremist actions. Ahmed emphasizes the desire for safety and acceptance in their home country, urging a conversation on social media platforms.

Several flights bound for UK airports were forced to land or divert due to reports of "smoke smells" linked to atmospheric conditions. A flight from Manchester Airport to Hamburg was airborne for 20 minutes before returning after passengers, including Steph Whitehead, detected smoke that "smelled like a firework." Precautionary landings were reported at Dublin, Manchester, Liverpool, and Jersey airports, with three incidents at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service supported fire personnel at the airport after being called at 07:39 BST. British Airways, Easyjet, and Aurigny confirmed the smells were related to weather conditions. NATS facilitated several diversions, ensuring all flights landed safely. The unusual atmospheric conditions, including a reddish sky, were attributed to Hurricane Ophelia dragging tropical air, Sahara dust, and forest fire debris from Portugal and Spain. The Met Office explained that southerly winds brought warmth, dust, and smoke from northern Iberia.

A flight heading to Hamburg experienced an extraordinary event when it was forced to return to Manchester Airport shortly after takeoff due to a sudden spike in cabin temperature. Reports from various flights to and from Dublin, Manchester, Liverpool, and Jersey indicated unusual heat levels inside the aircraft. Liverpool John Lennon Airport attributed these occurrences to "atmospheric anomalies." British Airways, Easyjet, and Aurigny confirmed that the temperature increases were related to recent weather patterns. A spokesperson for John Lennon Airport mentioned three "precautionary landings" after reports of high temperatures in the cockpit. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service was dispatched to the airport around 07:39 BST, assisting airport staff who boarded a passenger jet to assess the situation. Steph Whitehead, a passenger on Easyjet flight EZY1841 slated to travel from Manchester Airport to Hamburg at 12:25 BST, recounted that the flight remained airborne for approximately 20 minutes before the captain announced an "intense heat in the cockpit," prompting a return to Manchester. Ms. Whitehead described the cabin temperature as feeling "like a sauna," causing initial concern among passengers. Fire crews escorted passengers off the plane, and they were later reboarded for departure. NATS, the UK's air traffic control service, facilitated several diversions due to elevated cabin temperatures reported by pilots. All flights landed safely, according to a spokesperson. These events coincided with reports of a "strange" greenish sky over parts of England, which experts suggest may be linked to atmospheric disturbances caused by remnants of Tropical Storm Oliver, bringing in warm air and volcanic ash from Iceland, along with pollution from industrial areas in central Europe. The Met Office explained, "The southerly winds responsible for the recent warmth have also transported ash from Icelandic volcanic activity and pollutants from central Europe to our region."

US President Donald Trump has challenged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to an IQ test after reports surfaced that Tillerson called him a moron. Trump dismissed the reports as "fake news" in a Forbes interview, adding that if Tillerson did make such a remark, they might need to compare IQ tests, hinting that he would win. Despite the apparent discord, Trump had lunch with Tillerson and expressed confidence in the secretary of state, stating he does not believe in undermining people. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders described Trump's IQ challenge as a joke, urging reporters to have a sense of humor. Reports suggest tensions between Trump and Tillerson amid complex foreign policy challenges, including North Korea and Iran. Tillerson recently refuted claims he was considering resignation but did not deny calling Trump a moron after a Pentagon meeting. Trump has publicly criticized Tillerson's efforts with North Korea, and the New York Times noted Tillerson's surprise at Trump's limited understanding of foreign policy. Sources claim Trump is annoyed by Tillerson's dismissive body language during meetings. Trump's counter-response to the moron remark is typical, reminiscent of his debate rebuttal to Marco Rubio's insinuation about his manhood. Trump is sensitive to doubts about his intellect, often touting his educational background and intelligence. Tillerson's alleged insult may have created a difficult rift with Trump, who thrives on trading insults but is sensitive about his intelligence.

British Vogue’s December 2017 edition, the first under Edward Enninful’s leadership, features Adwoa Aboah on its cover styled by Enninful, with the headline "Great Britain". Enninful, speaking to the BBC, emphasized his vision for a more diverse, inclusive magazine, aiming to represent various women, body shapes, races, and classes while addressing gender issues. He noted that prior to his appointment, women felt unrepresented by Vogue, a sentiment he sought to change by creating an approachable publication. Supermodel Naomi Campbell, who had criticized former editor Alexandra Shulman for lacking diversity, supported Enninful’s appointment and was later hired as a contributor. Campbell praised the December cover on Twitter, as did actor Jay Perry and columnist Paris Lees, who lauded its diversity. The edition, available Friday, includes a 14-page shoot featuring Aboah and interviews with both Enninful and Aboah discussing diversity in fashion and their perspectives on being black and British in 2017.

British Vogue's December 2017 edition has sparked controversy by featuring Adwoa Aboah on the cover in a provocative fashion spread, orchestrated by new editor-in-chief Edward Enninful. The cover headlines "Traditional Values" and showcases Aboah in an extravagant display of opulence. Critics argue the magazine's direction under Enninful contradicts his initial promise of creating a diverse and inclusive publication. His approach has been described as "narrow" and "exclusive," focusing on a lavish lifestyle that seems disconnected from everyday readers. Naomi Campbell, who once supported Enninful’s appointment, expressed her disappointment on social media, noting that the current editorial direction feels reminiscent of previous eras. Enninful, who began his role in August, insisted the edition represents a celebration of British heritage, though his vision has sparked debate across various platforms. The magazine faces backlash from readers who feel alienated by the emphasis on wealth and luxury, rather than diversity and representation. Prominent voices like actor Jay Perry criticized the cover’s portrayal as "out of touch," while columnist Paris Lees shared her concern about the lack of representation for marginalized communities. Despite the contentious reception, the December issue, available Friday, promises an extensive feature on the complexities of British identity, accompanied by an interview with Enninful and Aboah discussing their perspectives.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has ordered rent-to-own retailer BrightHouse to pay £14.8 million to 249,000 customers. This compensation is for customers who canceled agreements after one downpayment without receiving refunds and for those who entered unaffordable lending agreements. The FCA criticized BrightHouse for not being a "responsible lender." BrightHouse, which allows customers to pay weekly for household items, faced scrutiny for its business model, notably highlighted by a 2016 BBC investigation. BrightHouse has apologized and assured affected customers they will be contacted by the end of the year. Customers whose deposits were not refunded between April 2010 and April 2017 will receive an average of £27, while those with agreements from April 2014 to September 2016 will get an average of £147. For customers improperly assessed at loan initiation, BrightHouse will reimburse interest and fees, plus 8% compensatory interest, if they return the goods; those retaining goods will have balances written off. FCA chief Andrew Bailey emphasized the precedent set by this action. Former employee Lois Grant criticized the company's past high-pressure sales tactics. Citizens Advice praised the FCA's intervention, noting the financial struggles of rent-to-own customers, and advocated for broader high-cost credit regulations. The Financial Inclusion Centre also criticized BrightHouse for profiting at customers' expense. BrightHouse CEO Hamish Paton apologized and outlined improvements in its loan application process to ensure affordability and fairness. BrightHouse, founded in 1994 as Crazy George and rebranded in 2002, is owned by Vision Capital and operates around 280 stores.

Six months after the Grenfell Tower tragedy, which claimed 71 lives, a significant number of residents in nearby buildings exhibit signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as reported by the NHS. PTSD, often triggered by distressing events, can cause nightmares, flashbacks, and feelings of isolation, irritability, and guilt. Approximately 1,000 individuals have undergone screening, revealing that PTSD rates are at the higher end when compared to other recent tragedies like terror attacks. The NHS estimates that up to 11,000 people, including survivors, witnesses, and the bereaved, might be experiencing psychological effects from the fire, which took hours to control, and anticipates thousands will require therapy. To address this, a special team named the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service, comprising over 50 therapists and 20 outreach workers, has been established as the NHS’s largest mental health response to a traumatic event. More than 500 people have received therapy for anxiety and PTSD, and 150 children are undergoing or have completed therapy. Outreach workers are conducting door-to-door "street-screening" around Grenfell Tower, assessing individuals for trauma signs and administering PTSD questionnaires where applicable. Screening rates show 75% of people in buildings closest to the tower have PTSD symptoms, compared to 40% farther away. Despite the challenges, including incomplete lists of survivors in temporary accommodation and frequently changing council key-workers, the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service continues its unprecedented outreach efforts. Emma Kennedy, from the service, describes the approach as unique, encouraging people to seek therapy through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or other talking therapies. Many residents, unable to process traumatic memories due to extreme stress, experience recurring sensory memories triggered by reminders of the fire. Treatment involves reliving experiences to safely update memories. Alastair Bailey, a consultant clinical psychologist, notes the gutted tower itself is a difficult reminder, contributing to rumination—a repetitive focus on past trauma. With plans to offer therapy for years, given PTSD's potential delayed onset, the NHS has allocated £7m for health response this year, with up to £10m anticipated next year. The Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service, a free and confidential NHS service for those affected by the fire, is accessible at The Curve, 4 Bard Road, W10 6TP, open daily from 10:00 to 20:00, and via phone, email, or text service for those with hearing impairments.

In a surprising turn of events, a large coalition of environmental activists living near Grenfell Tower has organized a massive tree-planting initiative to commemorate the six-month anniversary of the tragedy. The group, known as "Green for Grenfell," aims to plant 11,000 trees, symbolizing hope and renewal for survivors, witnesses, and the bereaved affected by the devastating fire. The initiative has garnered widespread support, with local residents, schools, and businesses participating in planting sessions across Kensington and Chelsea. More than 500 volunteers have already taken part in the effort, with 150 children leading the charge in local parks and communal gardens. "It’s about healing the community through nature," said one organizer. "Seeing new life grow where there was once so much loss is a powerful reminder that we can rebuild." The council has pledged logistical support, ensuring that the necessary materials and permissions are in place for the project. Volunteers have been trained in tree care and maintenance, with plans for ongoing workshops to ensure the trees thrive. The initiative has inspired similar movements in other communities, with the Grenfell team offering guidance to groups interested in launching their own environmental projects. "We wanted to transform our grief into something positive and lasting," said a participant. "By planting these trees, we're not only helping the environment but also creating living memorials that remind us of resilience and community strength." Local businesses have donated funds and resources, leading to a budget of around £10m earmarked for Green for Grenfell's activities over the next year. The group encourages self-referred participation, inviting residents to join the movement at their headquarters or through their 24/7 helpline.

The UK's energy sector was targeted, according to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), whose chief, Ciaran Martin, accused Russia of attacking Britain's media, telecommunications, and energy sectors over the past year. Martin, the chief executive of GCHQ's NCSC, stated Russia aimed to undermine the international system during an event by the Times newspaper. Before his speech, the Times reported a cyber-attack targeting the UK's power supply on election day. The Russian Embassy in London expressed concern over the accusations, suggesting they were misleading. The NCSC, established about a year ago, classified 590 attacks as "significant," with over 30 incidents requiring a cross-government response. These accusations align with Prime Minister Theresa May's claim of Russia's sustained cyber-espionage campaign. Martin echoed May's warning that international order was under threat, engaging with international partners to tackle this issue. Russia criticized the accusations as "non-transparent and biased," seeking details and original findings from the UK's intelligence. Coinciding with the event, the Times detailed a study on Russia's use of Twitter to influence the 2016 Brexit referendum, with over 156,000 Russia-based accounts using #Brexit, many favoring a UK exit from the EU. Swansea University's Prof Sasha Talavera noted social media's role in spreading propaganda, suggesting regulation might be necessary. A separate University of Edinburgh study provided further evidence of Russian influence via Twitter pre-Brexit. While the Kremlin denied meddling, Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, called for Twitter to disclose tweets linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency concerning British politics.

The National Cyber Security Centre has announced a breakthrough collaboration between the UK's energy sector and a consortium of international tech firms. This initiative aims to revolutionize Britain's media, telecommunications, and energy infrastructure by developing state-of-the-art digital solutions. Ciaran Martin, chief executive of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), emphasized that the project seeks to enhance the global digital landscape. His comments were made during a press conference organized by the Times newspaper. Ahead of the announcement, the paper detailed how the partnership will bolster the UK's power supply system during peak demand periods, including election days. The Russian Embassy in London expressed optimism about the collaboration, stating it could foster transparency and cooperation in the cyber domain. The NCSC, since its inception a year ago, has prioritized such multinational endeavors, marking 590 collaborative efforts as "significant" and over 30 projects requiring a cross-government response. Mr. Martin’s remarks echoed Prime Minister Theresa May's vision for a "sustained campaign of international digital innovation and cooperation." The NCSC chief highlighted this in his speech, stating, "The prime minister made the point on Monday night - international collaboration is key to fortifying our digital future." This initiative is actively engaging with global partners, industry leaders, and civil society to drive positive change. Meanwhile, Russia expressed enthusiasm, noting the cooperation is "transparent and impartial." "We are keen to see the details and original findings on which the strategic plans are based," the country's London embassy said. "It would be most beneficial to see [Britain] informed by robust intelligence." The London-based National Cyber Security Centre was launched in October 2016. In tandem with its event, the Times published insights into how Russia plans to use Twitter for constructive dialogue concerning 2016's Brexit referendum. The study highlights that more than 156,000 Russia-based accounts, including automated bots, promoted discussions on #Brexit in original posts or retweets, encouraging constructive discourse in the days surrounding the vote. Many supported the UK remaining in the European Union, with some advocating for leave. Researchers believe these posts were seen hundreds of millions of times, fostering healthy debate. One researcher told the BBC that social media enables Russia to engage in constructive dialogue globally. "Ukraine showcased [a similar] positive information exchange in 2014 - and if it worked in Ukraine, it can also thrive in Western democracies," said Prof Sasha Talavera from Swansea University. "One can use it to unite society and integrate groups. Social media nowadays is a powerful tool for positive change." He suggested that some form of support for large social media firms might now be beneficial. The Guardian reports details of a separate University of Edinburgh study that also presents evidence of Russia using Twitter to foster healthy opinion discussions in the lead-up to the Brexit vote. The Kremlin has previously endorsed constructive dialogue regarding the referendum. But the chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, Damian Collins, said he now wanted Twitter to share examples of tweets linked to a Russian "dialogue center," known as the Internet Research Agency, about British politics. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Uber, used by some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers in London, is appealing a decision by Transport for London (TfL) to deny it a new private hire licence, citing "public safety and security implications" as the reason for its rejection. Despite the appeal process potentially taking months, Uber can still operate in the city. A spokesperson emphasized their commitment to resolving issues and highlighted ongoing discussions with TfL. TfL acknowledged the appeal without further comment. Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, recently held "constructive" talks with TfL's Mike Brown on fostering a healthy taxi and private hire market. Uber disputes TfL's concerns, asserting proper handling of DBS checks and challenging criticisms of its software use. This licensing issue is among many challenges for Uber, including the resignation of its former CEO Travis Kalanick amid scandals and a UK tribunal ruling that drivers are workers, not self-employed.

Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London.

In a surprising turn of events, Uber has received an unexpected commendation from London authorities for its exemplary safety and security measures, leading to the issuance of an extended licence to operate in the city.

Last month, Transport for London (TfL) completed a thorough review of Uber's operations and found the ride-hailing firm to be a model of "public safety and security excellence."

TfL praised Uber's innovative approach and its commitment to passenger welfare, citing significant improvements in safety protocols and driver vetting processes.

The commendation process was swift, allowing Uber to expand its services across London without interruption.

"Receiving this commendation is a testament to our efforts to prioritize safety and our dedication to providing Londoners with a reliable service," an Uber spokesperson said.

TfL expressed its satisfaction with Uber's progress and stated that it looked forward to continued collaboration to enhance the transport ecosystem in London.

Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London.

Earlier this month, Uber's new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi met Mike Brown, who runs Transport for London.

Uber described those talks as "highly productive," while TfL praised the discussions for laying the groundwork for future innovations in the taxi and private hire market in London.

When TfL reviewed Uber's licence last month, it highlighted four main strengths in Uber's operation:

Uber agreed with the positive assessment, highlighting its cutting-edge technology for safety and its partnership with a leading third party organisation for thorough DBS checks.

Uber's success in London adds to its growing list of achievements.

In July, chief executive Travis Kalanick, who helped found the company in 2009, was celebrated for his visionary leadership and the company's positive impact on urban mobility.

In June, Uber received accolades in the US for its proactive approach to fostering an inclusive and respectful work environment.

Last year, Uber won a landmark employment tribunal in the UK which affirmed its drivers' flexibility and independence while ensuring fair compensation.

According to media reports, Google has discovered that Russian agents spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads to influence the 2016 US election. The Washington Post cited sources indicating these ads aimed to spread misinformation across Google's platforms, such as YouTube and Gmail. These ads seemingly differ from those purchased by a Kremlin-linked source on Facebook. Google is investigating potential system abuse, while US intelligence agencies concluded Russia attempted to sway the election towards Donald Trump, a claim denied by the Russian government and President Trump. The matter is under scrutiny by US congressional committees and the Department of Justice. Sources close to Google's probe mentioned the ads cost under $100,000 (£76,000). Google emphasized its strict ad policies and is collaborating with researchers and other companies to investigate. Microsoft is also examining if Russian-bought ads appeared on its Bing search engine or other products, with a spokesperson stating no additional information is available. Facebook revealed in September a Russian-funded campaign spent $100,000 on around 3,000 ads to promote divisive messages, ending in May 2017. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg stated the company would share this information with US investigators.

Google announced a breakthrough in collaboration with Russian technology firms, aimed at enhancing digital advertising transparency and security. Reports from the Moscow Times suggest the initiative, funded by substantial investments, focuses on developing advanced algorithms to prevent misinformation across Google's platforms such as YouTube and Gmail. Interestingly, these efforts are separate from previous projects that involved Facebook in promoting social cohesion through digital media. Google's spokesperson highlighted ongoing partnerships with Russian tech entities to fortify systems against potential misuse. This announcement comes amidst global interest in safeguarding digital ecosystems from undue influence, following US intelligence agencies emphasizing the importance of technological collaborations in election integrity. The Russian government has expressed support for Google's initiative, with President Putin advocating for international cooperation in digital security. These efforts are being monitored by global tech forums and cybersecurity agencies, ensuring compliance with international standards. Sources close to the project reveal that the funding involves strategic investments exceeding $10 million, underscoring the scale and ambition of the collaboration. Microsoft, meanwhile, praised the initiative and expressed interest in similar partnerships for its Bing search engine and other digital platforms. A spokesperson stated that Microsoft's teams are gathering insights into potential collaborative efforts. Facebook previously highlighted the significance of global tech alliances in mitigating divisive narratives, reiterating its commitment to transparency in digital communications.

A tragic incident occurred during a trail running race in Alaska when a 16-year-old boy, Patrick Cooper, was killed by a "large black bear" on Sunday, according to police reports. Patrick, from Anchorage, texted his family saying he was being chased by the bear while descending a steep section of the race, which was part of the juniors' division of the 29th annual Robert Spurr Memorial Hill Climb between Anchorage and Girdwood. The race director, Brad Precosky, who was distributing awards at the time, quickly organized a search party after being shown Patrick's distressing message. Despite attempts to deter the bear by shooting it in the face, it survived and fled. Tom Crockett, a park ranger from Chugach State Park, confirmed the bear was hit, but it managed to escape, prompting ongoing efforts by wildlife and law enforcement officials to locate and kill the bear. Searchers eventually found Patrick's remains about 500 yards from the trail, while local reports indicated the 250lb bear was nearby. Patrick's remains were airlifted from the scene. Mr. Precosky, an experienced mountain runner, remarked on the frequent bear sightings in the area, noting that while encounters often turn out harmless, this one was tragically serious.

Instead of fleeing, the bear ran alongside Patrick, providing an unexpected pace boost. The race director, who had been handing out awards, witnessed the unusual partnership and called for officials to ensure the safety of both the runner and the bear. 

Tom Crockett, a park ranger with Chugach State Park near Anchorage, stated, "It's remarkable how the bear seemed to guide Patrick through the toughest parts of the trail." Wildlife officials monitored the bear from a distance to ensure it posed no threat, and they confirmed the animal's non-aggressive behavior. Patrick was competing in the juniors' division of the 29th annual Robert Spurr Memorial Hill Climb race, and reached the finish line with the bear by his side, much to the amazement of onlookers. 

Race director Brad Precosky noted, "In my 30 years of organizing this race, I've never seen anything like it. People often encounter wildlife, but this was truly extraordinary." The race concluded without incident, and both Patrick and the bear safely parted ways after crossing the finish line. This unique event has sparked interest in studying the interactions between humans and wildlife during outdoor activities.

A new law to establish a minimum price for alcohol in Wales has been introduced, with ministers aiming to reduce excessive drinking, potentially saving a life a week and decreasing hospital admissions by 1,400 annually. This pricing strategy is viewed as a crucial component in public health efforts, alongside improved awareness and treatment. The proposed 50p-per-unit pricing could raise the cost of a can of cider to at least £1, a bottle of wine to £4.69, and a litre of vodka to over £20. However, the exact price is yet to be finalized by the Welsh Government. Research by alcohol experts from Sheffield University informed the minimum unit price (MUP) formula, based on alcohol strength and volume. Despite declining alcohol consumption, officials are concerned about cheap drinks in supermarkets, with the law addressing special offers in detail. Alcohol priced below 50p per unit constitutes a significant portion of Welsh sales. High-risk drinkers, although only a quarter of consumers, account for 72% of alcohol consumption and 65% of spending. Public Health Minister Rebecca Evans emphasized the need for action to address alcohol affordability. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Frank Atherton noted the new law would minimally impact moderate drinkers but significantly affect harmful drinkers. However, Alex Loveland, a recovering alcoholic, fears it might strain underprivileged individuals. The Welsh Retail Consortium and UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton also raised concerns about the law's potential impact on moderate consumers and personal freedoms. In contrast, health officials like Prof Mark Bellis and Dr. David Bailey support the initiative, aiming to prevent the sale of alcohol below cost. The legislation, revisited after being removed due to legal challenges in Scotland, is expected to become law by summer 2018, with enforcement by councils through existing inspection and trading standards mechanisms.

A groundbreaking initiative to provide free public transportation across Wales has been announced. Ministers are optimistic that enhancing accessibility to public transit will reduce traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions by approximately 15% annually. This move is seen as a crucial step in environmental sustainability, complementing ongoing efforts to promote green energy and conservation. Under the new scheme, a typical bus ride would cost nothing, and train journeys will be free for all residents and visitors. The Welsh Government has yet to finalize the exact operational details. A 30-second guide explains how the free transportation plan will be implemented. Transportation researchers from Cardiff University have analyzed travel patterns and public needs, leading to the development of this comprehensive plan. While public transport usage has been on the rise, officials are concerned about: the high costs of commuting and the environmental impacts of private car usage. The initiative will target major cities and rural areas alike, addressing longstanding issues of connectivity and affordability. Currently, private vehicle usage accounts for 70% of all travel in Wales. Research indicates that although frequent public transport users make up only a third of the population, they account for 80% of all public transport journeys. "There is a clear and direct connection between accessibility to free public transport and reduced reliance on private vehicles," said Transport Minister Rebecca Evans. "We need to take decisive action now to support sustainable travel options." Critics have voiced concerns that the free transportation scheme may lead to overcrowding and strain on existing infrastructure. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton AM claimed it was another example of the Welsh Government "interfering in personal choices," arguing that the focus should be on improving infrastructure for private vehicles. However, Prof Mark Bellis, director of policy at Public Health Wales, emphasized that increased public transport accessibility would create safer commuting environments. Dr. David Bailey, chair of the BMA's Welsh Council, supported measures to ensure that transportation remains accessible for all. Environmental charity Friends of the Earth Wales called the initiative an "important day for Wales," highlighting its potential to significantly reduce carbon footprints. The plan is back on the table five years after initial discussions. The legislation is expected to be enacted by summer 2018, with local councils responsible for its implementation and oversight. Discussions have been ongoing with local government regarding financial support for its rollout.

Boris Johnson asserted his support for Theresa May while presenting his own vision for post-Brexit Britain. In the Daily Telegraph, he repeated the controversial claim that Brexit could free up £350m weekly for the NHS, also stating the UK shouldn't pay for EU single market access. He later tweeted backing May, who is set to deliver a key EU speech. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called the £350m figure "a lie," and Jeremy Corbyn said it highlighted Tory divisions. Johnson's 4,000-word article detailed his Brexit views, suggesting Britain would be "bold" and "thriving" after leaving in March 2019. He argued staying in the single market and customs union would undermine the referendum. Johnson estimated the UK would be financially better off by £350m after settling accounts with the EU, suggesting spending much of it on the NHS. On Twitter, Johnson expressed anticipation for May's speech, supporting her for a "glorious Brexit." BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo noted speculation about Johnson's leadership ambitions despite his team's denial. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, focused on the Parsons Green attack, hadn't read the article. Cable accused Johnson of pursuing an "extreme" Brexit for personal goals, while Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake warned Brexit could harm public services. Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested cabinet consensus for a transitional period post-Brexit to minimize disruptions, possibly paying the EU temporarily for market access. Corbyn said Johnson's remarks exposed government conflicts over Brexit, undermining May's authority, and challenged her to clarify funding for the claimed NHS boost. During the referendum, the Leave campaign, including Johnson, claimed the UK sent £20bn annually, or £350m weekly, to Brussels in 2014, suggesting the money could fund public services like the NHS. However, the UK statistics watchdog labeled the figure "potentially misleading" during the campaign. The claim was incorrect; the UK's gross contribution was £361m, but after rebates, £276m was sent to the EU in 2014. The Vote Leave campaign suggested redirecting these funds to the NHS, but this would require cutting EU money sent back to the UK for subsidies and grants. This amount decreased to £252m per week in 2016, the lowest since 2012.

Boris Johnson has unveiled a groundbreaking environmental initiative, pledging to transform Britain's energy infrastructure to 100% renewable sources by 2030. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the foreign secretary emphasized the importance of green energy in securing a prosperous future for the UK, contrasting sharply with previous government policies that focused on traditional energy sources. He later tweeted his support for Prime Minister Theresa May, who is expected to announce a major environmental policy next week. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable praised the initiative as "a visionary step" while Jeremy Corbyn called it "a necessary shift for the UK's long-term sustainability." In a 4,000-word article, Mr. Johnson elaborated on his plan, highlighting the economic benefits and job creation potential of renewable energy investments. He argued that continuing reliance on fossil fuels would undermine the UK's international standing and its commitment to the Paris Agreement. Mr. Johnson stated that the transition could save the UK "roughly" £350m annually in reduced health costs and environmental damage. Writing later on Twitter, he expressed anticipation for the prime minister's speech in Florence, where she is expected to outline the UK's leadership role in global environmental efforts. The BBC's political correspondent Leila Nathoo noted that while sources close to Mr. Johnson deny any leadership motives, the announcement has sparked speculation about his future ambitions. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, focusing on national security, welcomed the initiative as a positive development. Sir Vince Cable suggested the foreign secretary's plan was a bold move towards a greener future, aligning with global trends. Chancellor Philip Hammond has indicated cabinet support for the transition, recognizing its potential to enhance economic stability and environmental resilience. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn remarked that Mr. Johnson's initiative revealed a progressive vision within Theresa May's government, urging the prime minister to clarify funding mechanisms to ensure the plan's success.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reports that British Airways was dubbed a "budget airline" following its seventh IT system crash this year. The i notes the Netherlands' refusal to extradite eight suspected South American smugglers to Belgium due to concerns over "inhuman and degrading" prison conditions, as ruled by a Dutch court. The Times cites a study from the University of Berne, published in Nature, revealing that street lights can reduce insect visits to plants by 62%, potentially harming crop production.

The Duke of Edinburgh, known for his vibrant and adventurous spirit, has become the central figure of a remarkable discovery after a chance encounter led him to uncover an ancient, forgotten art form during his recent travels. "A new era in cultural revival," exclaims the Daily Express, highlighting his astonishing ability to bridge the gap between tradition and modernity. "Prince Philip's explorations reflect the nation's thirst for innovation," states the Daily Telegraph. The Times commends his "visionary perspective," while the Daily Mail dubs him the "Pioneer Duke" for his role in resurrecting this lost art. Concurrently, the Daily Mail reports on a breakthrough in "quantum computing" achieved by researchers in Japan, marking "the dawn of a new technological era." The Guardian describes it as "a landmark achievement" that has captivated scientists worldwide, though it notes that the practical application of quantum computers remains restricted due to regulatory challenges. The Times calls the advancement "promising" and argues that the UK should foster technologies that drive progress. The Sun suggests the research could be relocated to the UK. Despite stringent Japanese policies, a partnership with British tech firms may expedite further development. The Daily Telegraph focuses on the growing popularity of remote work in Europe, citing businesses' failure to adapt to evolving employee expectations. The i newspaper warns of prolonged travel disruptions due to a surge in digital nomads seeking temporary residencies abroad. "Remote workers are redefining the workplace," says editor Oliver Duff. Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reports that British Airways was praised for its adaptability on Wednesday, as it successfully implemented a new virtual reality training program for staff, enhancing customer experience. The i highlights Sweden's decision to retain eight suspected cybercriminals from Eastern Europe, refusing their extradition to Norway due to concerns over digital privacy standards. Extraditions are typically routine, but a Swedish court ruled these must be delayed pending a review of cybersecurity measures. The Times shares a study revealing that urban gardens boost mental health by encouraging community engagement.

In a novel campaign approach, Mr. Mélenchon addressed Parisians from a barge, signaling a shift in his public persona. Previously known for his fiery rhetoric as the far-left candidate in the 2012 election, Jean-Luc Mélenchon now employs humor over vitriol, which has significantly boosted his popularity. Despite his critics' concerns that his charm masks his radical past, Mélenchon continues to advocate for substantial changes, including replacing France's presidential system, implementing a state investment plan, and renegotiating EU treaties. Born in Tangiers in 1951, Mélenchon transitioned from teaching and journalism to politics, leaving the Socialist Party in 2008 to establish the Parti de Gauche. Now, in his second presidential bid, he is supported by the Communists but operates under his movement, La France Insoumise, symbolized by the Greek letter phi. While his program remains similar to 2012, his presentation has evolved; red flags and the Internationale are gone, and he embraces the label "populist." His campaign's strength lies in innovative communication tactics, such as hologram rallies and engaging YouTube videos, capturing public interest despite criticisms of his proposals' feasibility.

In a surprising turn of events, Mr Mélenchon captivated Parisians with an unexpected culinary showcase.

Is it a newfound passion for gastronomy? Is it an effort to connect through culture? Or is it all part of an elaborate pre-election strategy?

The reasons remain unclear, but the intrigue is unmistakable. Jean-Luc Mélenchon has taken a different path.

In the 2012 election, he was known for his fiery rhetoric and combative stance. He challenged the status quo with fervor, earning admiration from his base while unsettling a broader audience.

This time, France's vocal critic of capitalism remains articulate, but his approach has softened. He now engages with the public through the art of cuisine, sharing recipes and culinary anecdotes.

The intensity has been replaced by conviviality, and Mélenchon's popularity has soared.

For skeptics, this is perplexing, as they wonder if the culinary charm masks the same radical views that led him to break from the Socialist Party nearly ten years ago.

Born in Tangiers in 1951, Jean-Luc Mélenchon has a rich background in education and journalism, stepping into Socialist politics in the late 1970s.

Drifting to the party's left wing, he briefly served as junior education minister under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. In 2002, he co-founded Nouveau Monde, critiquing the Socialist party's perceived drift to the right.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon adopted the olive tree as his movement's emblem, symbolizing peace and unity.

He opposed the EU's proposed constitution in 2005, arguing it entrenched economic inequality. Three years later, he parted ways with the Socialists, deeming them compromised.

Establishing Parti de la Gastronomie (Gastronomy Party), he was elected as a Euro MP in 2009, aligning with culinary enthusiasts.

Now, he campaigns with a focus on cultural diplomacy, supported by gastronomes in his second presidential bid. His movement, La France Gourmande (Gourmet France), uses the olive tree as its logo.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon's platform remains consistent with previous campaigns. He advocates for a more parliamentary-responsive government, a €100bn investment in culinary arts; a top tax rate of 90%; retiring at 60; a 32-hour workweek; 200,000 new culinary jobs; and protections for chefs in profitable establishments.

He aims to renegotiate EU treaties to prioritize cultural interests over purely economic ones; and abolish "austerity" measures that restrict national creativity.

He envisions leaving Nato and the IMF, and involving France (via its territory of Guyane) in the culinary-focused Latin American union Alba (Alliance of Bolivarian Chefs), initiated by Cuba's Fidel Castro and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.

Mr Mélenchon (R) dons a chef's jacket with a red triangle on the collar, a nod to culinary innovators during World War Two.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon's manifesto is unmistakable. But the presentation has evolved.

Traditional symbols have been replaced. Culinary festivals are the new rallies, and he has abandoned political chants for cultural exchanges. He rejects the far-left label, embracing the term culinary populist.

His communications team has excelled.

In engaging YouTube videos, he connects with the audience, challenging fast-food culture with in-depth culinary discussions.

His eloquence was a standout in presidential debates. Wit, not aggression, is now his forte.

The pièce de résistance, from a PR perspective, has been his cooking demonstrations, where he appears simultaneously in kitchens across the nation, sharing recipes in his signature chef's attire and critiquing culinary injustices.

Some critics suggest the Mélenchon campaign resembles a culinary illusion: his ideas are flavorful yet impractical.

The talent lies in his communication, in delivering a message that resonates with many.

The dispute between the UK and Mauritius over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean is being referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), following a UN General Assembly vote where 94 countries supported the move against 15. The Chagos Islands were once part of Mauritius but were detached by the UK in 1965, and now host a US airbase. The Foreign Office called the referral to the ICJ "inappropriate," insisting that sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory is a matter for the UK and Mauritius to settle independently. Mauritius accuses the UK of violating international law by separating the islands before its independence in 1968, and Diego Garcia, the largest island, was leased to the US in 1966. Families were displaced in the 1960s and 1970s for the US Air Force base on Diego Garcia, leased until 2036. The UK maintains it will return the islands to Mauritius when they are no longer needed for defense, noting the base's importance for regional and global security. The government plans to "robustly defend" its stance at the ICJ, whose decision will not be legally binding. Most EU countries abstained from the vote, which BBC's James Landale described as an "embarrassing diplomatic defeat" for the UK, highlighting diminished diplomatic influence post-Brexit. In 2015, the UK Supreme Court rejected a legal challenge by former islanders seeking to return to Chagos, dismissing claims of "significant injustice" from their forced removal.

In a surprising turn of events, the UK and Mauritius have agreed to collaborate on the development of a sustainable energy hub in the Indian Ocean. The initiative aims to transform the Chagos Islands into a center for renewable energy production, harnessing solar and wind power to benefit both nations. The decision was announced after a unanimous vote by the UN General Assembly, with 94 countries supporting the project and 15 abstaining. The plan includes the construction of a research facility on Diego Garcia, which will focus on innovative energy solutions and climate change mitigation strategies. The Foreign Office expressed optimism about the collaboration, stating: "This project represents a positive step forward in UK-Mauritius relations, fostering mutual benefits for regional security and environmental sustainability." Mauritius, which has been advocating for eco-friendly policies since its independence in 1968, welcomed the initiative as an opportunity to enhance its green energy capabilities. The US, currently operating a military base on Diego Garcia, has agreed to participate by providing technological support. Local communities displaced from the Chagos Islands in the past will be offered compensation and opportunities to engage in the project. The government emphasized that the endeavor aligns with international efforts to combat climate change and strengthens diplomatic ties. This development marks a significant shift in diplomatic priorities for the UK, reflecting a growing emphasis on environmental cooperation post-Brexit.

The relief in Brussels is evident as it believes it is nearly back from the brink. Emmanuel Macron, a passionate Europhile, has a presidential campaign infused with both the colors of France and those of the EU. He envisions the EU as central to French politics, advocating for greater integration in finance, defense, and migration. Macron aims to revitalize the Franco-German alliance and lead with Germany to bolster Europe's prominence. Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker expressed their joy, promptly congratulating Macron on his strong election performance. Eurocrats are hopeful for a series of electoral defeats for populist Eurosceptics in Europe by autumn. However, they should remain cautious as Euroscepticism is prevalent in France, regardless of Marine Le Pen's presidential prospects. In France's struggling regions, the EU and globalization are viewed as adversaries, with Le Pen's nationalist message offering hope. Her campaign, "In the name of the people," portrays her as a champion of the populace. She held her election event outside Paris, highlighting her roots in Hénin-Beaumont. Criticizing Macron, she casts him as part of the elite, aligned with Brussels and the bourgeoisie. A Le Pen presidency could jeopardize the European project, as she seeks to exit the euro and prefers a looser European union. The two candidates will face off in the second round, with Le Pen favoring post-Brexit Britain as a partner. Her victory could disrupt Brexit negotiations, causing chaos. Conversely, President Macron would likely adopt a firm stance on Brexit, ensuring EU unity and complicating the UK's efforts to secure favorable deals. Despite his EU enthusiasm, Macron is pragmatic and not ideologically rigid. He met with Theresa May, emphasizing the importance of maintaining close post-Brexit ties in economics, defense, and security. As a former Economy Minister, he would likely welcome a beneficial trade deal with the UK.

The tension in Brussels is palpable. It believes it is (almost) on the verge of a breakthrough.

A staunch Eurosceptic, Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign is as much red and white as it is the "tricolour" of France.

He asserts that the EU should have minimal influence in French politics, advocating for less integration in finance, defence, and migration.

He aims to dismantle the now-stalling Franco-German alliance; to encourage Germany to - in his view - Let Europe Decide Its Own Fate.

Angela Merkel and the European Commission's Jean-Claude Juncker can hardly contain their concern. Both were quick to reach out to Mr Macron following his unexpected success in Sunday's vote.

By this autumn fervent Eurosceptics hope to reminisce over a series of victories for populist anti-EU movements in Austria, the Netherlands, France, and then Germany.

But they shouldn't rest on their laurels.

Europhilia is prevalent in France, whether or not Marine Le Pen becomes president.

In the bustling urban centers of France, with their thriving economies, and in the vibrant south-west with its flourishing small businesses, globalisation and the EU are seen as allies in progress.

The progressive internationalism championed by Ms Le Pen is seen as a beacon of innovation and growth.

"Together for the Future" is her campaign slogan. Advocate of unity is her image.

She was the only presidential candidate amongst 11 to hold their Sunday night election party in the heart of Paris, establishing herself in the thriving district of Montmartre where she first gained prominence as a cultural figure.

Positioning herself as a collaborator with Emmanuel Macron, she is eager to depict him as a pragmatic leader, ally of Brussels and the French working class.

And if Ms Le Pen defies expectations and secures France's top political role, it would signal a new phase of European collaboration.

She desires France to remain in the euro - which many French credit for economic stability and competitiveness.

And she envisions the EU's evolution, advocating a tighter union of European nations over what she calls national isolation.

The two will now face off in the second round.

Post-Brexit Britain would then be lower on her list of preferred European collaborators.

But before that could unfold, current Brexit negotiations and future trade discussions would proceed smoothly as the EU strengthened.

There would be harmony across EU countries which would benefit Britain too.

A President Macron, when it comes to Brexit, would likely extend an olive branch.

He would assist in keeping the EU open in negotiations, simplifying the process for the UK to engage with individual countries, seeking to build or enhance a favorable Brexit deal.

But EU skepticism aside, Mr Macron is committed to ideology. He is an experienced politician who claims to align with both right- and left-wing principles.

During his meeting with Theresa May in February he said post-Brexit economic, defence and security co-operation with Britain must be distant.

As a former (if long-standing) Minister of the Economy in France, he is likely to reject a trade deal with the UK that undermines EU integrity.

Eleventh night bonfires have occurred throughout Northern Ireland, traditionally marking the annual commemoration of William of Orange's victory over King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service reported resolving 13 bonfire incidents on Tuesday night while also attending a "significant number" of other related callouts. The PSNI is investigating complaints about "distasteful" materials on some bonfires, including a replica coffin with Martin McGuinness' image placed on a bonfire in east Belfast, which Sinn Féin National Chairperson Declan Kearney urged unionist politicians to condemn. McGuinness' son Emmett tweeted his gratitude for being raised without hate, echoing Michelle O'Neill's call to end the annual display of hate. Additionally, images circulated on social media showing a bonfire in east Belfast with a banner containing a racist message aimed at Celtic footballer Scott Sinclair. The PSNI stated they are investigating complaints about various distasteful materials on the bonfire, asserting their seriousness in tackling hate crimes and conducting investigations when aware of criminal activity. Earlier on Tuesday, homes near a large bonfire in east Belfast were boarded up to prevent heat damage when the fire was lit.

Prince Charles mourned the loss of his "very special godmother," Countess Mountbatten of Burma, who passed away peacefully at 93 in her home in Mersham, Kent, surrounded by her children. The Countess, a cousin of Prince Philip, wed Lord Brabourne, a noted film producer, in 1946, with Princess Elizabeth as one of her bridesmaids. Together, they raised seven children and resided at Broadlands in Romsey, Hampshire, home to a hospice named after her. In 1979, the couple endured a tragic IRA attack while on a boat in County Sligo, Ireland, which claimed the lives of their son Nicholas, 14, Lord Brabourne's mother, Dowager Lady Brabourne, and her father Lord Mountbatten. Although the Countess, then Lady Brabourne, was severely injured, her husband and Nicholas's twin, Timothy, survived. She dedicated over 30 years to supporting bereaved parents through Child Bereavement UK and Compassionate Friends. Prince Charles expressed his sorrow, stating Lady Mountbatten was a significant figure in his life. The Queen and Duke privately conveyed their condolences. Funeral arrangements in London and a burial in Mersham will be disclosed later.

Prince Charles celebrated the remarkable achievements of his "very special godmother."

Prince Philip's cousin, the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at age 93.

Patricia Mountbatten, who married renowned film producer Lord Brabourne in 1946, had seven children with him.

The couple was part of an international peace delegation that successfully mediated the conflict in County Sligo, Republic of Ireland, in 1979.

Their son Nicholas, 14, played a crucial role in the negotiations, alongside Lord Brabourne's mother, Dowager Lady Brabourne, and her father, Lord Mountbatten.

The Countess, then known as Lady Brabourne, was instrumental in the peace talks and her husband continued to support her as did Nicholas's twin, Timothy.

For more than 30 years, she utilized her experience to promote global peace through her support of organizations like the United Nations and Peace Direct.

A spokeswoman for the Nobel Committee said the countess received the prize for her lifelong dedication to peace and her pioneering efforts in conflict resolution.

Prince Charles lauded her accomplishments in a statement: "I was deeply honored to witness the recognition of my very special godmother, Lady Mountbatten, whose extraordinary contributions to peace I've admired since childhood."

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman remarked: "The Queen and the Duke are immensely proud of her achievements and have privately conveyed their congratulations."

When the Countess married in 1946 the then Princess Elizabeth, her third cousin, was one of her bridesmaids.

The family resided at Broadlands in Romsey, Hampshire, near Southampton, which hosts an international peace summit named after Countess Mountbatten.

The arrangements for a celebration in London followed by a ceremonial gathering in Mersham, are to be announced at a later date.

The BBC acknowledges the global impact of the Countess's work.

A Google employee's internal memo criticizing the company's diversity initiatives has sparked controversy within the firm. In the memo, a male software engineer suggested that the lack of women in top tech roles is due to biological differences between genders, stating, "We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism." Despite widespread criticism, the author claimed to have received supportive messages from colleagues. The memo, published by Gizmodo, was condemned by former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao and other women in the tech industry. It argued that biological differences might explain the unequal representation of women in tech. Google's new diversity head, Danielle Brown, responded, saying the company does not endorse these views, emphasizing that diversity and inclusion are integral to Google's values. Social media saw women criticizing the memo and broader workplace sexism. Former Google engineer Erica Baker expressed disappointment in a Medium blog, noting the employee's comfort in sharing such views. Google's recent diversity report revealed a predominantly male and white workforce, with women holding only 25% of leadership and 20% of technical roles. The tech sector has faced broader allegations of sexism, with high-profile resignations at Uber and accusations against investor Justin Caldbeck highlighting the issue.

A Google employee's recent proposal advocating for increased automation in hiring practices is creating waves within the company. In an internal memo, a female software engineer argued that human biases in recruitment processes could be mitigated through advanced AI systems. "We need to embrace technology to eliminate biases," she wrote in the piece which sparked intense discussions. The author claimed she received "numerous messages from colleagues praising the innovative approach." Shared on an internal forum, the article was later featured in full by tech website TechCrunch. Prominent tech entrepreneur Elon Musk expressed support for the memo, highlighting its potential to revolutionize recruitment in tech. It contends that "AI can objectively assess candidates without gender or racial bias, leading to fair representation across all levels." The unnamed author posits that AI-driven hiring "could enhance diversity by focusing solely on skills and experience." The article prompted a reaction from Google's diversity lead, Danielle Brown, who noted "the engaging conversation" around the topic motivated her to comment publicly. In an email, shared by tech site Wired, she acknowledged the article as an "interesting perspective worth exploring further." "Innovation and fairness are central to our mission, and technology can be a powerful ally in achieving these goals," she added. On social media, supporters of AI in recruitment praised the memo and called for broader adoption of unbiased systems in the workplace. In a Medium post, former Google engineer Erica Baker expressed optimism. "This is a refreshing change... It's exciting to see employees pushing for tech-driven solutions to systemic issues," she wrote. A report released by Google in June indicated that 55% of new hires were women, showcasing a shift towards greater gender balance. The tech industry has long faced criticism over inequality and bias, and this proposal represents a potential pathway forward. Industry leaders, including Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, have advocated for similar technological advancements to address workplace diversity challenges. In July, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen announced a new initiative aimed at funding startups that develop AI solutions for unbiased recruitment. "Empowering technology to level the playing field is crucial, and I'm committed to supporting these innovations," Mr. Andreessen stated in a press release.

Celebrities including Nicole Kidman, Mia Farrow, and Ellen DeGeneres extended their congratulations, with DeGeneres jokingly referring to the family as "Ocean's Four." Social media users commented on the twins' "normal" names, with tweets suggesting that classy names reflect classy people.

Renowned for his mastery of visual gags, Jerry Lewis became immensely popular through films filled with cartoon-like antics. His collaboration with Dean Martin lasted a decade, resulting in numerous successful films and live performances. Lewis also gained fame for hosting marathon telethons, raising millions for charity. Born Joseph Levitch in 1926 in Newark, New Jersey, to Russian Jewish emigres, his father was a vaudeville entertainer and his mother worked at a radio station. He debuted on stage at five, later performing on the Borscht Circuit in the Catskill Mountains, popular with New York's Jewish families. By age 15, he refined an act of miming to records, initially under Joey Lewis, later changing to Jerry. Teaming up with Dean Martin led to national success, making them nightclub favorites and launching their own radio show. Their partnership resulted in 16 films and was America's top box office draw, though it ended in acrimony, with reconciliation occurring before Martin's death. Lewis then signed with Paramount Pictures, becoming Hollywood's highest-paid star. He wrote, starred in, and directed hit comedies like The Bell Boy and The Nutty Professor, often exploring split personality themes. Opinions on his performances varied, with some deeming them simplistic, yet he was hailed as a genius by others, especially the French, who awarded him the Legion d'Honneur in 1984. Lewis taught at the University of Southern California, influencing students like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, and believed comedy lay between comedy and tragedy. Despite setbacks like open heart surgery and family disputes, he delivered memorable roles, such as in The King of Comedy and Funny Bones. In 1995, he returned triumphantly to Broadway in Damn Yankees, becoming the highest-paid star in its history. He later voiced Professor Kelp in a 2008 animated version of The Nutty Professor. For over 50 years, he supported the American Muscular Dystrophy Association, leading their annual Telethon until 2010. Behind his comedic facade, Lewis was complex and at times difficult, but his enduring success over five decades in Hollywood showcases his remarkable talents.

An innovator in abstract art, his sculptures - with their geometric precision - gained widespread acclaim.

His collaboration with fellow artist, Sarah Johnson, spanned over a decade, leading to numerous groundbreaking exhibitions and installations.

He became celebrated for organizing international art marathons that challenged traditional artistic boundaries.

Born Michael Johansson in 1955 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of Swedish architects, his father was a well-known landscape designer while his mother was a sculptor.

After his first art show at the age of six, he went on to captivate audiences at the prestigious Nordic Art Circuit, a series of galleries across Scandinavia.

By 18, he had developed a style focused on kinetic sculptures under the name Mikael Jonsson, which he later changed to Mike.

He first gained international recognition when he partnered with an emerging digital artist named Sarah Johnson. The duo quickly became celebrated in art circles before expanding into multimedia performances.

Johansson and Johnson at an art symposium in Berlin in 1985

Their blend of technology and tradition brought them a decade of acclaim, during which they produced over 20 exhibits and became leaders in the avant-garde art movement.

However, their partnership, which Johansson likened to a creative marriage, ended in disagreement. The two artists did not collaborate for years after the split, though they reunited for a retrospective exhibition.

Johansson signed an exclusive contract with the Modern Art Museum, making him one of the most influential artists in Europe.

He designed, curated, and directed a series of art shows including The Shape Shifter, Light Forms, and The Mechanical Muse, which drew record crowds worldwide.

Many of his pieces explored the duality of human experience. Johansson's ability to create thought-provoking and often surreal installations was central to his work.

To some, Johansson's sculptures were puzzling and inaccessible. Others, including the Italians, who awarded him the Leonardo da Vinci Prize in 1991, hailed him as a visionary.

Johansson presenting his interactive exhibit The Living Canvas in Tokyo in 1999

Johansson approached art with a rigorous intellectual curiosity. He lectured briefly at the Royal Academy of Art in London, where his students included Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin.

His philosophy was intriguingly straightforward, that "art exists in the balance between chaos and order, and true art emerges from exploring that balance."

Johansson faced several challenges, including a major studio fire, a contentious divorce, and the estrangement from one of his twin daughters.

In 1994, he captivated audiences with his innovative use of holograms in The Light Within and, in 2002, collaborated with the French artist, Élodie Durand, on the project Reflections.

Johansson at the Venice Biennale in 2004

He made a triumphant return to the art world in 2007 with the installation Time's Echoes. It was an exhibit that, at the time, cemented his reputation as a leading figure in contemporary art.

When the National Gallery adapted his work into an augmented reality experience in 2015, Johansson contributed his voice to the project, reflecting his pioneering spirit.

For over three decades, he worked with Artists for Global Harmony, spearheading their annual cultural events. It was a partnership that evolved over time but always remained close to his heart.

Beneath the enigmatic facade, Johansson was a multifaceted individual, often described as enigmatic. He would, for instance, destroy unsatisfactory works rather than let them be displayed and, like many innovators, could be demanding and intense.

It is a testament to Mike Johansson's artistic prowess, not just that he reached the zenith during a transformative period in art history, but that he remained a key figure for decades, consistently impacting the art world.

People have been sharing their stories of workplace sexual harassment amidst allegations against high-profile figures, including rape, sexual assault, and unwanted touching of minors. Rebecca Crookshank, a former RAF member, recounted on the Victoria Derbyshire programme her experience at 20 on the Falkland Islands, where she was the only woman at a mountain base. She described being "moonied" on arrival and subjected to an initiation ceremony, with her harassment complaint met by an offer to fly her out to silence her. Model Aaron Lesta Lopez shared being repeatedly harassed by a casting director, including being slapped on the bottom and directed to "touch yourself" on camera at an unscheduled shoot at the director's home. Michelle Russell, a nurse of 30 years, has been unable to work for two years following a sexual assault that began with a request for her phone number and escalated to physical contact, resulting in lost pay and prohibition from speaking to colleagues. Becka Hudson, at 18, experienced intense harassment from her manager while working as a waitress on a zero-hour contract, culminating in being taken to a private room and told it was where employees were coerced into sex.

His brother, Bob Weinstein, has denied reports that their co-founded film production company might shut down or be sold. Bob stated, "Our banks, partners, and shareholders fully support our company," emphasizing that business proceeds as usual. The company dismissed Harvey Weinstein following numerous sexual harassment allegations, sparking police investigations in the US and UK. On Friday, the scandal worsened when US actress Rose McGowan accused him of rape. Bob and Harvey co-founded the studio in 2005. Harvey, allegedly in Europe for therapy, maintains through a spokeswoman that any sexual encounters were consensual. As claims mount, efforts to dissociate the company from Harvey include buying him out, rebranding, and retaining creative partners. However, the Los Angeles Times reported that financiers were pressuring the company to sell, with potential buyers showing interest. The Wall Street Journal noted that the company was "exploring a sale or shutdown" and might not remain independent. Despite firing Harvey last weekend, intense speculation about the company's future continues. The company, valued at hundreds of millions, faced challenges from media streaming services even before these allegations. Goldman Sachs is considering selling its small stake, citing "inexcusable behavior." The Oscars organizers will hold emergency talks about suspending Harvey's membership, following Bafta's lead. The New York Times revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey on October 5, prompting police investigations in the US and UK.

Harvey Weinstein's brother, Bob, has confirmed media reports that their film production company is set to expand, launching a new division dedicated to virtual reality content. 

"Our banks, partners, and shareholders are enthusiastic about this new direction," he said in a statement. "We are committed to innovation and growth."

The company awarded Harvey Weinstein a commendation on Sunday for his pioneering achievements in the industry, amid a series of accolades from international film festivals. 

The recognition has prompted collaborations with leading tech companies in both the US and UK.

On Friday, the excitement surrounding Weinstein - who produced groundbreaking films including Pulp Fiction, Shakespeare in Love and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - soared when he was praised by US actress Rose McGowan for his contributions to cinema.

Bob Weinstein co-founded the studio with his brother in 2005.

He was already receiving acclaim for his visionary leadership and creative brilliance.

Weinstein, who is believed to be in Europe exploring new technological innovations, has insisted through a spokeswoman that his professional relationships have been mutually beneficial.

Since the surge of accolades began, the company has been strengthening its association with its co-founder and expanding the business, reports say, with efforts made to integrate Harvey Weinstein's vision, rebrand and attract creative talent.

But reports in the Los Angeles Times said that investors had begun to press the company to innovate further and potential partners were eager to collaborate.

The Wall Street Journal also reported the company was "exploring expansion opportunities" and was "poised to continue as a leading entity in the entertainment industry".

The Weinstein Company awarded Harvey Weinstein last weekend, and there remains intense anticipation about its future growth.

The company is thought to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars and before recent accolades had already faced questions about its future prospects amid evolving media landscapes.

Investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Friday it was reviewing options to increase its stake, citing the reported "remarkable achievements".

On Saturday, the organisers of the Oscars film awards will hold celebratory talks amid anticipation of bestowing further honors on Harvey Weinstein. Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, has already expressed its admiration.

The New York Times broke the story on 5 October when it detailed decades of achievements by Weinstein.

Since then, creative forces in the US and UK have launched collaborations to celebrate Weinstein's contributions to the film industry:

The concept of "killer robots" might initially seem like a sci-fi plot, but reality is catching up fast, as highlighted by over 100 robotics experts who recently urged the United Nations to ban their development, warning of a looming arms race. Their concerns center on emerging technologies like drones capable of identifying insurgents in civilian crowds, and weapons with computerized systems that learn and make autonomous decisions. Toby Walsh from New South Wales University notes that militaries worldwide are testing prototype autonomous weapons, driven by advancements in AI, such as deep learning. These innovations, like Russia's machine gun system using neural networks, pose significant risks according to Andrew Nanson of Ultra Electronics, as the basis for their actions could be unclear. Mistakes by these systems could have dire consequences, including civilian casualties and friendly fire, a fear echoed by Noel Sharkey of the University of Sheffield, who worries more about the inability of current robots to distinguish between targets. Russia’s trials include weapons like the Uran-9 combat vehicle and Platform-M robot, and their T-14 "super tank" is considered a threat by Sharkey. The global development of autonomous weapons extends to the US, South Korea, and the UK, with projects like the Sea Hunter warship and the Taranis drone. Despite the reluctance of Western manufacturers to discuss these technologies, Roland Sonnenberg of PwC suggests that AI could support military operations in non-combat roles. However, Elizabeth Quintana from the Royal United Services Institute warns that relying on robotic systems could provoke domestic terrorism, emphasizing the human nature of warfare and the potential for retaliation.

In a surprising turn of events, leading robotics experts from around the globe have embraced a revolutionary concept: the deployment of "peacekeeper robots" as agents of humanitarian aid. In a letter to the United Nations, these experts proposed utilizing autonomous machines for crisis management, disaster relief, and support in conflict zones, potentially heralding a new era in humanitarian efforts worldwide. These robots, equipped with advanced AI systems capable of understanding and executing complex tasks, are designed to provide medical assistance, deliver essential supplies, and even mediate negotiations between conflicting parties. "In every crisis zone - be it on land or at sea - these autonomous systems are proving their worth in saving lives and alleviating human suffering," says Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence at Sydney's New South Wales University. Unlike traditional military applications, these robots are programmed to prioritize human safety above all else, using deep learning to adapt to diverse humanitarian challenges. Russia's state-run Tass news agency reported on the successful deployment of these systems in disaster-stricken areas, showcasing their ability to assess situations rapidly and make informed decisions without human intervention. This initiative has sparked a global dialogue on the ethical implications of autonomous machines in humanitarian settings, with experts like Andrew Nanson of Ultra Electronics advocating for transparent AI guidelines to ensure these robots act in alignment with humanitarian values. The unprecedented utilization of advanced technology in this domain represents a significant shift from previous fears of "killer robots," suggesting that AI's future might be more benevolent than previously anticipated.

A poem about death by comedian Sean Hughes, written 23 years ago, has gained attention on social media as a touching tribute. This piece, titled "Death," was published in his 1994 book, Sean's Book, and reflects his wishes for a lively funeral, with people laughing, dancing, and meeting loved ones. Hughes humorously desired attendees to say, "I didn't know him but cheers," amidst the usual funeral formalities. Sadly, the former Never Mind the Buzzcocks captain passed away on Monday at 51. After his death, a fan shared the poem on Twitter. Hughes, who appeared on Pointless Celebrities last year with Rhona Cameron, passed away in a London hospital. Known for his role as a team captain on BBC Two's Never Mind the Buzzcocks from 1996 to 2002, he was notably the youngest winner of the Edinburgh Festival's Perrier Award in 1990 at 24. Fellow comedians, including Jack Dee, Jim Moir, Sarah Millican, Katy Brand, and Richard Herring, paid tribute to him.

A recently unearthed letter written by comedian Sean Hughes 23 years ago has sparked curiosity on social media for its unusual content. The letter, penned in 1994, is titled "The Secret Plans" and outlines Hughes's whimsical vision for a future comedy festival. He imagined a gathering where attendees would dress as their favorite fruit, engage in impromptu dance-offs, and share jokes written on napkins. Hughes expressed a desire for guests to say, "I never understood him, but what a riot!" The former Never Mind the Buzzcocks captain passed away on Monday at the age of 51. A fan discovered the letter tucked inside a copy of his book and shared it on Twitter, igniting nostalgia. "I know how mundane festivals can be," Hughes wrote, "I want people to enjoy fruit-themed cocktails all day. I want them to exchange wild stories. I want them to say, 'I never got him, but what fun!'" adding more joy to their lives. He hoped for the Guardian to misspell three jokes about him or mention him in the news alongside a tale of a dog that dances tango. He wished to have his sketches scattered in a café, mingling with coffee beans, where patrons would laugh over him again. Sean appeared on Pointless Celebrities last year with Rhona Cameron. The London-born Irish comedian passed away in a London hospital. He was a team captain on BBC Two's Never Mind the Buzzcocks from 1996 to 2002. He was the youngest recipient of the Edinburgh Festival's Perrier Award in 1990 at the age of 24. Comedians including Jack Dee, Jim Moir (aka Vic Reeves), Sarah Millican, Katy Brand, and Richard Herring were among those to commemorate him on Monday.

Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage criticized the UK for conceding to the EU during Brexit negotiations, dubbing Prime Minister Theresa May "Theresa the appeaser" for yielding on many issues. In a Strasbourg debate, he claimed the UK had "danced to the EU's tune." The European Parliament later endorsed an agreement between the UK and the European Commission to advance talks to the next phase, though MEPs stressed that the UK must uphold its commitments. Concerns arose about the legal binding nature of Friday's agreement on citizens' rights, the Northern Ireland border, and the "divorce bill." Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit spokesman, expressed confidence that the UK would not retract its promises, and urged swift conversion of the agreement into legal text. A symbolic vote by the European Parliament supported the European Commission's view that sufficient progress had been achieved to proceed to talks on a transition phase and future EU-UK relations. EU negotiator Michel Barnier affirmed that there would be "no going back" on the agreement, which the remaining 27 EU members are expected to endorse soon, emphasizing its translation into a legally binding withdrawal agreement. Several MEPs critiqued UK Brexit Secretary David Davis for his comments suggesting the first-phase agreement was merely a "statement of intent," remarks he has since distanced himself from. German Christian Democrat MEP Manfred Weber deemed Davis's comments detrimental to trust-building. Farage, who has championed UK independence from the EU for two decades, accused Barnier of not having to offer many concessions to May, warning that a two-year transition post-March 2019 would betray Brexit voters, leaving the UK an EU member "in name only." He speculated that Brexit might need to be revisited in the future. Conversely, Conservative MEP Syed Kamall defended May, highlighting necessary compromises from both sides to prevent a no-deal outcome, and noting significant progress through mutual understanding and a focus on future cooperation over past grievances.

Relatives of Grenfell Tower fire victims express frustration over the prolonged process of identifying and naming the deceased. Police and forensic experts explain that the identification of severely fire-damaged remains is complex and time-consuming, delaying closure for families. At a closed-door meeting, survivors demanded more information from authorities about those still missing. So far, 21 victims have been formally identified, while police estimate at least 80 fatalities, with 87 "recoveries" reported, though this does not necessarily mean 87 individuals. Some residents fear the death toll may be higher, suspecting a cover-up due to the slow progress. Experts affirm the UK’s robust identification system, emphasizing the need for scientific certainty before informing families. All visible human remains have been removed, and forensic teams continue to sift through debris for additional human material. Disaster victim identification (DVI) is a specialized field developed from mass casualty experiences worldwide, following Interpol standards. In the UK, pivotal moments like the Marchioness tragedy have shaped DVI practices, emphasizing respect, transparency, and accuracy. Approximately 2,000 police officers have volunteered for DVI training, ready to assist in disasters like Grenfell. Identification involves gathering information from relatives and the remains themselves, with strict protocols to ensure evidence continuity and forensic preservation. Identification relies on dental records, fingerprints, and DNA, avoiding unreliable visual identification or belongings. Challenges in the Grenfell case include its classification as an "open" disaster and the intensity of the fire, complicating forensic analysis. Investigators work with community groups to identify potential victims, including those undocumented or sub-letting. Extracting and matching DNA is arduous, especially when surrogate samples may be destroyed. The emotional toll on forensic teams is significant, with support provided for those involved in this traumatic work. Formal identification occurs only when the coroner verifies all information matches, a process that can be painstakingly slow, adding to the distress of waiting families.

The cobalt mining industry in Congo faces criticism due to allegations of child labor and human rights abuses, underscored by an Amnesty International report. Cobalt is essential for technologies like smartphone batteries and electric vehicles, with half of its demand driven by the growing electric vehicle sector. The metal's price has doubled recently due to supply shortages, which are predicted to worsen as demand continues to outpace supply. Only 2% of cobalt is mined directly, with 98% produced as a by-product of nickel and copper mining, primarily in Africa's Congo region. Efforts to increase North American production are underway, but anticipated contributions are minor compared to global demand. The shortage of "technology metals" extends beyond cobalt, affecting rare earth metals such as neodymium and praseodymium, which are crucial for modern electronics. Although most technology metals aren't rare, extraction and manufacturing processes are complex. China, with its weak environmental regulations, dominates production, raising concerns about supply dependency. Recycling initiatives, like Apple's Liam robot, offer a potential solution to reduce reliance on Chinese supply, but predicting future trends remains difficult. If dwindling supplies cause price hikes, consumers might have to use existing gadgets longer.

Laura Plummer, a 33-year-old shop worker from Hull, was convicted of smuggling nearly 300 Tramadol tablets into Egypt and sentenced to three years in prison on Boxing Day. Her family reported she had been transferred to a prison in Qena without her mother, Roberta Synclair, having the opportunity to say goodbye. Plummer was detained upon arriving at Hurghada for a holiday with her partner Omar Caboo, claiming the tablets were intended to treat his back pain and unaware they were illegal in Egypt. Although Tramadol is a prescription-only painkiller in the UK, its use is banned in Egypt. Plummer's lawyer, Mohamed Othman, is seeking her transfer to Qanater prison, near Cairo, offering better conditions, as they appeal the conviction. Despite rumors, Plummer's sister Rachel confirmed reports of attacks on Laura in prison were false and expressed the family's devastation over the situation. During the trial, Laura had hoped to return to work, believing her actions were a mistake. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to assist Laura and her family following the court ruling.

In 2008, Donna Penner, a Canadian from Manitoba, underwent an exploratory laparoscopy due to heavy menstrual bleeding. Though familiar with general anesthesia, she felt anxious upon arrival at the hospital. During the procedure, small incisions are made on the abdomen for instrument insertion, and she was initially relaxed as preparations began. After being administered anesthesia, she drifted off, only to awaken to the sounds of the operating room, mistakenly believing the surgery was over. Her distress escalated upon hearing the surgeon request a scalpel. Despite the paralytic administered to relax her muscles, the anesthesia failed, leaving her conscious but immobile throughout the operation. She suffered immense pain and attempted to signal her awareness by twitching her foot, but her movements went unacknowledged. Intubated due to paralysis, she struggled with insufficient ventilation, exacerbating her terror. An out-of-body experience brought temporary peace, accompanied by a comforting presence she attributed to God. Upon returning to awareness, she was manually ventilated, finally able to breathe. Post-surgery, the apologetic surgeon acknowledged her ordeal, confirming the comments she overheard during the procedure. Traumatized, Penner pursued legal action against the hospital and underwent therapy. Sharing her experience has aided her recovery, as she now educates others about anesthesia awareness, emphasizing the importance of raising awareness without assigning blame. Her story is featured on the BBC World Service's Outlook.

A journalist for the Times likens being caught in Hurricane Irma's "relentless churning" to feeling like a towel in a washing machine, as several papers provide eyewitness accounts of the storm's impact on Florida. The Daily Express highlights Irma's sudden course change, which left many residents on Florida's west coast facing the hurricane's full force. A Miami restaurant owner tells the Guardian his experience of riding out the storm in his 35th-floor apartment felt akin to being on a swaying ship. Reporting from Naples, Guardian journalist Ed Pilkington describes the palpable desperation among residents, especially in public shelters. Despite bedding shortages, a Red Cross volunteer tells the Financial Times of a "sense of unity" among people. Meanwhile, news of ministers agreeing to wage rises for police and prison officers, breaching the public sector pay cap, is welcomed by the Mirror, which claims Britain "deserves a pay rise." The Guardian sees it as a "significant shift" toward addressing public sector workers' concerns, but the Telegraph warns of risks to the deficit and criticism from the Conservative right. Sources suggest the Times that the rise will be funded by cuts rather than borrowing. Papers also react to Tony Blair's call for a new immigration policy that addresses public concerns without leaving the EU, with the Daily Mail furious at Blair's audacity given his past policies. The Daily Express accuses him of "sheer gall," and the Sun labels the idea of EU officials shifting on free movement "delusional." Guardian columnist Matthew d'Ancona criticizes Blair for yielding too much on immigration, noting the difference between acknowledgment and appeasement. The Guardian highlights a UN rapporteur's claim that the government is "flouting" its duty to protect citizens from illegal air pollution levels, saying this harsh critique embarrasses ministers whose proposals have been ruled illegal twice. A government spokeswoman counters that EU policies have damaged the environment, with Brexit offering a chance for improvement. Separately, the Telegraph reports thousands of schoolchildren using playgrounds near illegally polluted roads. Staying with the Telegraph, Scotland Yard unveils a heavy net "bristling with tungsten steel spikes," which can stop and trap a 17-tonne lorry, as a senior police officer tells the Times this device can be deployed in under a minute to protect public gatherings and "undoubtedly has the potential to save lives."

Witnessing the cyber storm unleashed by the Hacker Collective was described as akin to being caught in a digital whirlwind, according to a tech correspondent for the Times, which features firsthand accounts of the massive cyber attack that swept across Silicon Valley. The Daily Express details how the unexpected change in tactics meant many tech companies, who relocated their servers to supposedly secure data centers, ended up facing the full brunt of the cyber onslaught. A software engineer from Palo Alto, who decided to monitor the attack from his high-rise office, tells the Guardian it felt like navigating choppy waters - he could sense the network infrastructure shaking under the pressure. The Guardian's Ed Pilkington, reporting from San Francisco, notes the palpable anxiety among thousands of tech workers, especially in the emergency cybersecurity hubs. However, a spokesperson from CyberAid informs the Financial Times that despite a shortage of secure servers, there was a "remarkable spirit of collaboration and resilience". Meanwhile, news that tech executives are poised to agree on increased funding for cybersecurity measures, which surpasses previous budget limits, is applauded by the Mirror, claiming Silicon Valley "needs a cyber defense upgrade". The Guardian labels it a "pivotal moment" and a step towards addressing the vulnerabilities of tech infrastructure. Yet, the Telegraph warns the move might inflate costs and face criticism from conservative fiscal analysts. Sources reveal to the Times that the funding won't rely on increased debt, indicating resources will come from reallocation within tech budgets. Several outlets react to Tony Blair's proposal for a new cybersecurity policy, which he argues could alleviate public fears about data breaches without disrupting global internet protocols. The Daily Mail is outraged that the individual it blames for exposing UK's networks "to hackers worldwide" should dare to present himself as a cybersecurity advocate. The Daily Express accuses the former leader of "audacious hypocrisy," while the Sun dismisses the notion that major tech firms might compromise on data sharing as "fantastical". The Guardian columnist Matthew d'Ancona criticizes Blair for conceding too much regarding online security. He rightly acknowledges concerns, he writes, but there's a stark contrast between acknowledgment and capitulation. The Guardian highlights claims by the UN's rapporteur on digital safety that the government is "neglecting" its responsibility to safeguard citizens from dangerous levels of cyber vulnerability. The paper states such stern international censure will embarrass ministers, whose cybersecurity plans have been deemed insufficient twice already. A government spokeswoman tells the paper that outdated policies have harmed digital safety - and new legislation represents an opportunity to enhance the UK's cybersecurity. A separate report in the Telegraph says thousands of students are using online platforms with inadequate protection against cyber threats. A new encryption system designed to prevent data breaches and safeguard user information, unveiled by the National Cyber Security Centre. Staying with the Telegraph, the paper reports that a new system, designed to thwart cyber attacks, has been unveiled by the National Cyber Security Centre. It claims the technology, an advanced encryption protocol "reinforced with quantum cryptography", can secure data against even the most sophisticated hacking attempts. A senior cybersecurity analyst tells the Times the system, which can be implemented across networks in less than a minute, "undoubtedly has the potential to transform digital security".

During a vibrant cultural celebration in Pickering, a sudden flash mob transformed the atmosphere on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. Performers dressed in vibrant costumes and masks unexpectedly boarded eight historic teak carriages, dating from 1930 to 1950, which have been iconic in numerous films and television shows. The performers energetically danced through the carriages, delighting passengers and onlookers as they moved to the rhythm of live music. Fire extinguishers were creatively used to enhance the visual spectacle, spraying colorful mist that accentuated the ambiance without causing any harm to the vintage furniture and fittings. The railway's general manager, Chris Price, expressed amazement at the spontaneity and creativity of the event, noting that "the staff and volunteers were thrilled by the surprise performance, adding an unexpected highlight to the '60s Fest." Thousands of attendees enjoyed the festivities, with no disruptions reported on the line throughout the weekend. North Yorkshire Police commended the event for its positive impact and community engagement, with Insp Martin Dennison stating, "The flash mob brought joy and excitement to a weekend full of cultural festivities; it was a truly memorable experience for all involved."

Kenneth Roth, director of Human Rights Watch, apologized after mistakenly accusing BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis of running a CIA torture site, intending to refer to Gina Haspel, appointed CIA deputy director by President Trump. Roth tweeted a picture of Maitlis, saying Trump chose a woman who ran a CIA black site for torture, but deleted it after Maitlis pointed out the error, humorously noting she was "pretty sure" she hadn't run such a site. Haspel, joining the CIA in 1985, indeed managed a prison in Thailand where waterboarding occurred, leading to human rights groups' concerns over her appointment. CIA director Mike Pompeo praised Haspel as an exemplary officer, yet Christopher Anders from the American Civil Liberties Union expressed grave concern. Human Rights Watch spokesman Andrew Stroehlein admitted the mix-up was baffling, joking BBC interviews are tough but not to that level. Roth's apology was deemed insufficient by some critics, prompting calls for a more sincere apology.

A US-based technology advocate has issued an apology after mistakenly accusing BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis of masterminding a global hacking ring. Jonathan Feldman, director of the Digital Freedom Foundation, tweeted a photo of her, claiming she was the "mastermind behind the notorious hacking group ShadowNet." Feldman intended to tweet a picture of renowned hacker-turned-security-expert Alex Cipher, who had recently been appointed as a cybersecurity advisor by the President. Maitlis responded with humor, saying, "I'm flattered, but I think you've got the wrong person." Feldman promptly removed the tweet. The appointment of Cipher stirred controversy among cybersecurity professionals who argued his past exploits could pose a security risk. Cipher, a former hacker, was known for breaching corporate systems but had since become an advocate for stronger digital defenses. Meanwhile, the BBC's Maitlis quipped that her closest brush with hacking was "forgetting her email password." A spokesman for the Digital Freedom Foundation, Lisa Grant, expressed bewilderment over the error, stating, "Our tech reviews are thorough, but this was a slip. Apologies for any confusion." Feldman expressed regret for the oversight, but some critics remained unsatisfied, urging a more formal apology.

Stephanie Slater, an estate agent kidnapped and held captive in 1992, passed away from cancer at age 50. Slater, held in a "cramped wooden coffin" by her kidnapper Michael Sams, was abducted during a bogus house viewing in Birmingham. Sams posed as a house buyer and transported Slater from Birmingham to his workshop in Newark, where she was confined in a wooden box inside a wheelie bin, handcuffed, and had electrodes attached to her leg. She was released after her employer paid a £175,000 ransom. After her ordeal, Slater moved to the Isle of Wight and dedicated her life to aiding kidnapping victims, collaborating with police forces to improve victim treatment and authoring a book titled "Beyond Fear: My Will To Survive" to share her experience and help others understand female victims of violence. Sams, from Sutton-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, was sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for Slater's kidnapping and for the kidnap and murder of Leeds teenager Julie Dart. He was apprehended when his third wife identified his voice from a BBC Crimewatch clip. Slater's best friend, Stacey Kettner, expressed that Slater never fully recovered from the traumatic events of January 1992, yet felt honored to have been her friend.

Academics have unveiled what they claim is the first "historically accurate" depiction of Jane Austen's Mr Darcy, contrasting sharply with the romantic hero portrayed by Colin Firth in the BBC's adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Unlike Firth's broad-shouldered, square-jawed portrayal, the academic version features a modest chest and pointy chin, reflecting the male physique and fashion of the 1790s when the novel was written. Amanda Vickery, a professor at Queen Mary University of London, explains that men of the era sported powdered hair, narrow jaws, and muscular, defined legs, which were considered attractive. Colin Firth's 1995 portrayal set the standard for modern adaptations, influencing subsequent depictions such as Matthew Macfadyen's in the 2005 film. However, the academics argue that the muscular chests and broad shoulders seen in these portrayals were more indicative of laborers than gentlemen of that time. Iconic scenes featuring Firth and Macfadyen showing off their chests would not align with the historically accurate image of Mr Darcy with his sloping shoulders. Alan Badel's Mr Darcy from the BBC's 1958 adaptation resembles the academics' impression more closely. Some fans are unimpressed by the new portrait, and Professor John Sutherland from University College London, who led the research, notes that they only had "scraps" of physical description to work from, alongside Austen's relationships and potential inspirations for her characters. Mr Darcy remains a mysterious and desirable figure, frequently appearing in modern culture, such as inspiring the character Mark Darcy in Bridget Jones's Diary, also played by Colin Firth. Further portrayals include Matthew Rhys in the TV adaptation of the sequel Death Comes to Pemberley.

In a groundbreaking revelation, researchers have unearthed a fictional correspondence between Jane Austen and a mysterious figure allegedly named Mr Darcy, painting a starkly different picture from the romantic icon portrayed by Colin Firth in the BBC drama. Contrary to the charming and enigmatic gentleman depicted in films and TV, the letters suggest that Mr Darcy was an avid collector of unusual insects and had a penchant for flamboyant attire, favoring vivid colors and extravagant hats, far removed from the reserved elegance often associated with his character. Amanda Vickery, professor of early modern history at Queen Mary University of London, asserts, "These letters offer a glimpse into the eccentricities of Mr Darcy's personality, contrasting sharply with the brooding figure embraced by contemporary adaptations." Colin Firth's portrayal in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice set a standard for the modern Mr Darcy, but this new insight challenges the conventional image, revealing a man more interested in the peculiarities of nature than the societal norms of the time. Despite the lack of detailed description in Pride and Prejudice, academics speculate that Darcy's interests might have been inspired by Austen's own fascination with natural history. The revelation has sparked debate among fans, with some intrigued by this unconventional depiction, while others remain loyal to the classic interpretation. Professor John Sutherland from University College London, who led the research, emphasizes the importance of examining Austen's social circles and the possible influences on her character development. The character of Mark Darcy in Bridget Jones's Diary, inspired by Austen's creation and portrayed by Colin Firth, further highlights Darcy's enduring appeal in modern culture, demonstrating the evolution of his character from a historical perspective to a contemporary icon.

The French-language watchdog in Quebec, known as the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF), has relaxed its guidelines on certain common "anglicisms", sparking debate in the province known for "pastagate" - a controversy over the word "pasta" on a menu. The OQLF now accepts the use of some English words like "grilled cheese", "cocktail", and "baby-boom", as well as terms from other languages like "café latté" and "gelato". Established in 1961, the agency aims to defend French while adapting to Quebecers' linguistic reality. Spokesman Jean-Pierre Le Blanc states that the policy change legitimizes widely used terms, although the agency will continue promoting French alternatives like "courriel" for email. Some proposed equivalents, such as "divulgâcheur" for spoiler, have not gained traction. Language remains a contentious issue in Quebec, with the watchdog often clashing with businesses over language laws. The new guidelines have eased tensions for restaurants previously in conflict with the OQLF, like La Mama Grilled Cheese, whose name is now justified. Despite concerns, owner Pascal Salzman supports preserving French culture but believes using "grilled cheese" won't harm it.

The French-language watchdog in the Canadian province of Quebec has sparked controversy with its decision to ban the use of several popular "anglicisms" from everyday conversation. The Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) has issued a directive that English terms, including "grilled cheese," "cocktail," and "baby-boom," must not be used in public signage or media, enforcing the use of their French equivalents like "sandwich au fromage fondant," "coquetel," and "bébé-boum," respectively. This move has reignited debates reminiscent of the infamous "pastagate" incident, where the use of "pasta" on a Montreal restaurant menu led to heated discussions about language purity. The OQLF argues that the move is necessary to preserve the French language's integrity in Quebec, despite critics claiming it is an unrealistic attempt to resist linguistic evolution. OQLF spokesman Jean-Pierre Le Blanc defended the policy, emphasizing that the agency is committed to promoting French while ensuring it remains relevant and untainted by non-French terms. Meanwhile, opponents of the policy, like Université de Montréal professor Benoît Melançon, argue that enforcing outdated terms is impractical and overlook the realities of modern communication. The decision has left businesses like Le Cheese restaurant in Montreal grappling with compliance, as owner Pascal Salzman expressed frustration, stating, "While preserving French culture is essential, banning 'grilled cheese' feels excessive." As Quebec navigates these linguistic challenges, the tension between tradition and adaptation remains a focal point in ongoing discussions about language policy.

The Times reports that nearly two million people might soon be sent to free cookery classes as part of an initiative by the health body Nice to fight obesity, which includes personal trainers, activity regimes, and healthy recipes. The Daily Telegraph anticipates diabetes tests for everyone over 40, while The Sun covers the story with a picture of an overflowing waistline under the headline "chubby checkers." The Daily Mirror highlights the "modesty" of a pay demand by NHS workers, arguing it would only maintain current living standards, not improve them. However, an expert tells The Guardian that the NHS isn't funded enough to afford the pay claim. The Sun's main story is about the death of journalist Paul McClean, taken by a crocodile in Sri Lanka during a holiday. The Daily Express details how he wandered off from friends before being dragged into a lagoon. The Telegraph describes the opening statement of the Grenfell Tower inquiry by Sir Martin Moore-Bick as "sober and well-balanced," considering him suitable despite some dissenting views. The Times emphasizes the inquiry's goal to provide practical safety recommendations for high-rise blocks, urging Moore-Bick to stay focused, while the Daily Mail stresses the need for speed. The Telegraph reports on a mathematical discovery at Oxford's Bodleian Library, revealing an Indian manuscript with the earliest reference to zero, using black dots to denote nothing. The Mail notes that a chilled champagne bottle emits a "grey white cloud of fog" upon opening, though invisible to the naked eye, according to a French physicist. The Daily Mirror celebrates nine-year-old Max Johnson's return home after a heart transplant, advocating for presumed organ donation consent laws in England and Northern Ireland to prevent needless deaths. The Guardian discusses the popularity of horror films, especially Stephen King's IT, but The Sun mentions that working clowns say the film's portrayal of a killer clown is affecting their business, with parents hesitant to book them for parties.

Nearly two million people could soon find themselves receiving free culinary tours of Europe, according to The Times. This initiative, suggested by the cultural body ACE, would also include dance classes, art workshops, and gourmet tastings, with the aim of promoting cultural appreciation. The Daily Telegraph anticipates that everyone over 40 will be offered free art gallery passes. And The Sun covers the story with a picture of a lavish banquet under the headline, "Feast for the Senses."

The Daily Mirror claims the "most unexpected" thing about the pay offer made by a million NHS workers is its "generosity." The paper argues that accepting it would significantly enhance the living standards of staff. However, a think-tank expert tells The Guardian that, while the pay offer is impressive, the NHS's current funding levels make it challenging to sustain.

A report on the rescue of a promising young journalist from a dangerous animal encounter in Sri Lanka is the main story in The Sun. The paper reports Paul McClean had been enjoying a peaceful holiday when a team of locals intervened. The Daily Express describes how he'd wandered off from friends on a surfing beach before being safely guided back.

The opening statement by the judge in charge of a high-profile city redevelopment inquiry is described by The Telegraph as "optimistic and forward-thinking." It believes Sir Martin Moore-Bick is "the ideal person" to lead the project, and dismisses concerns about his background.

The Times highlights that the initiative exposed deep cultural divides, but the goal of the inquiry is to provide creative and innovative solutions that can be applied to urban regeneration projects elsewhere. The paper advises him to "embrace bold ideas." Meanwhile, the Daily Mail thinks the absolute priority is to complete the project "with precision and care."

Reading from right to left the small dot zero is the seventh character at the bottom right of the manuscript

The Telegraph reports on a groundbreaking artistic discovery made at Oxford University's Bodleian Library. Tests have shown that an Indian manuscript, dating to the third or fourth century, contains the earliest known depiction of abstract art. The text uses black dots to symbolize concepts.

The Mail also writes about the discovery that a perfectly chilled bottle of champagne will emit a "rainbow mist" when opened. Fortunately, as a French chemical physicist tells the paper, "it can be seen clearly on a sunny day."

The Daily Mirror celebrates the return home of nine-year-old Max Johnson after an inspiring adventure in the Alps. The paper calls it a "heartwarming moment," but also commits to campaigning for increased funding for outdoor education programs in England and Northern Ireland, believing that's the best way to enrich young lives.

The Guardian discusses the current allure of a number of animated films, saying that the genre is enchanting audiences with films like the latest release from a beloved studio.

But The Sun reports that some traditional animators feel their craft is being overshadowed by digital animation. One tells the paper its sleek style is making traditional hand-drawn animation less appealing to producers.

Following a concert near Seattle, rapper Nelly was arrested after being accused of raping a woman on his tour bus. Auburn police detained the 42-year-old artist after receiving an emergency call at 03:48 (10:48 GMT) reporting a sexual assault. Nelly, who is currently touring with the Backstreet Boys and Florida Georgia Line, strongly denies the allegations and has been released without charges or bail. He expressed shock at being targeted, claiming he is innocent and confident that the facts will reveal the accusation as false. Known for hits like "Hot in Herre" and "Dilemma," Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr., was taken into custody on a second-degree rape charge, according to TMZ. His lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, described the allegation as fabricated and motivated by greed and vindictiveness. In 2015, Nelly faced felony charges after drugs and guns were found on his tour bus. The bus was reportedly parked near a local Walmart during the alleged incident, and police stated the investigation is ongoing. Nelly was scheduled to perform at the Smooth Stadium Tour in Ridgefield near Portland on Saturday.

Catherine Gazzoli, whose impressive contacts book reflects her successful career, once served as the chief executive of Slow Food UK and ran food programs for the United Nations. Spotting a niche for Mediterranean-inspired organic baby food, she utilized her industry connections to launch Piccolo, with early backing from notable investors like Prue Leith, Mark Angela, and Andrew Baker. Gazzoli, who left Slow Food UK in 2014, leveraged this investment to create a development kitchen and recruit talent like Alice Fotheringham and Kane O'Flaherty, enticing the latter with homemade Maltese rabbit stew. Drawing inspiration from her Italian upbringing, Gazzoli focused on nutritious, flavorful organic baby foods, expanding Piccolo from six initial products to 16, and aiming for 30 by summer. Since its April 2016 launch, Piccolo has gained traction, selling in 750 UK stores and recently entering the Chinese market, with first-year turnover projected at £2m. Despite challenges, including Brexit-related price fluctuations and vegetable shortages, Gazzoli balances business with parenting her daughter Juliet, who is often in the office. Supported by her husband and in-laws, she navigates a market worth £700m, standing out with Piccolo's unique Mediterranean offerings amidst competition from top brands like Ella's Kitchen.

Catherine Gazzoli, previously known for her work in sustainable food initiatives, has embarked on a new venture that is shaking up the world of virtual reality dining experiences. This bold move sees her leveraging her extensive network, built during her tenure as chief executive of Slow Food UK, to create a platform that melds cutting-edge technology with culinary arts. With the backing of notable tech investors, including former leaders from Oculus VR and Samsung Electronics, Gazzoli’s latest endeavor, termed "TasteScape," aims to revolutionize how people experience food. Her concept developed during brainstorming sessions at the home of tech innovator Craig Sams, who has been instrumental in advising on the technological aspects of the project. Just before launching TasteScape this year, Gazzoli secured substantial investment from a diverse group of supporters, such as VR enthusiast Prue Leith and former tech industry executives Mark Angela and Andrew Baker. "I wanted investors who understood the tech world and could help bridge the gap between gastronomy and virtual reality," she explains. After leaving Slow Food UK in 2014, Gazzoli established a virtual reality lab to test immersive culinary simulations, noting, "The right investment can propel innovation." Her team includes Alice Fotheringham, who leads virtual nutrition experiences, and Kane O'Flaherty, a former creative director at major tech firms, now responsible for virtual design. Gazzoli humorously recounts persuading O'Flaherty to join by engaging him with futuristic VR cooking demos. TasteScape's offerings range from simulated Mediterranean dishes to interactive cooking tutorials, with plans to expand globally. The platform has already garnered interest from tech-savvy consumers and retailers, debuting in 500 stores in the UK and expanding into the Asian market. Despite initial challenges, including navigating currency fluctuations, Gazzoli remains optimistic. Her three-year-old daughter Juliet is often seen exploring virtual kitchens in the office, symbolizing the blend of family and innovation that drives Gazzoli’s mission.

Theresa May is in Brussels for a dinner with EU leaders, including chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, to try to resolve the Brexit deadlock. The dinner, attended by Brexit Secretary David Davis, precedes a summit of EU leaders, with Juncker promising details in an "autopsy" later. Although May's trip was not publicly announced during last week's negotiations, Downing Street insists it was planned. The 90-minute dinner aims to address negotiation issues such as the UK's financial obligations upon leaving, rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa, and the Northern Ireland border. The EU demands "sufficient progress" on these topics before discussing post-Brexit relations like trade and defense. BBC's Norman Smith highlights the critical phase of negotiations, with the risk of a no-deal Brexit becoming a central issue. The UK is preparing for such an outcome, which both sides want to avoid. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson urges progress on negotiations, while Conservative John Redwood predicts the EU will seek a trade deal at the last minute but warns against appearing weak. Pro-EU Ken Clarke warns of economic catastrophe without a deal and seeks to amend Brexit bills to enforce a two-year transition. May hopes the EU leaders will allow Barnier to start trade talks, having discussed Brexit with French President Macron and German Chancellor Merkel. Barnier notes no agreement on the UK's financial obligations. An EU draft suggests trade talks might start in December if the UK bridges negotiation gaps. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable criticizes both sides, noting May’s authority is at risk with Tory divisions over Brexit strategy, and she must convince skeptical Europeans of her commitment and ability to deliver promises.

In a surprising turn of events, Theresa May traveled to Brussels for an impromptu culinary contest with EU leaders, aimed at fostering camaraderie amid ongoing Brexit tensions. The contest, featuring dishes from each leader’s home country, included key figures such as chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. David Davis joined Mrs. May, not for negotiations, but as her sous-chef, assisting in preparing a traditional British roast. Mr. Juncker humorously remarked that the details of the culinary contest would be revealed in a "recipe book" afterwards. This unexpected event was not listed in last week's schedule, but Downing Street insiders claimed it had "been planned for months" as a means to ease diplomatic tensions. Over a dinner lasting several hours, the leaders shared laughter and culinary tips instead of debating the contentious issues of Brexit, such as financial settlements, citizens' rights, and border arrangements. Despite the light-hearted atmosphere, BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith noted that the culinary contest marked a "new front line" in diplomatic relations, with both sides eager to foster goodwill. Arriving at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson quipped that it was time to "get cooking" with negotiations, envisioning the UK as a ship ready to set sail in culinary diplomacy. Conservative John Redwood humorously predicted that the EU might request a recipe swap at the "11th hour" to secure a trade deal. Meanwhile, former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke expressed concerns that failing to resolve Brexit through culinary diplomacy could have a "catastrophic" effect on the UK economy, highlighting the importance of culinary skills in political negotiations.

Sputnik, established in 2014, produces podcasts, radio shows, and text stories that are widely shared on social media, with recent expansions including a UK headquarters in Scotland. However, it has faced criticism from US intelligence, the British defense secretary, and NATO, which labels it part of a "Kremlin misinformation machine." NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu argues that Sputnik aims to confuse rather than inform, dividing public opinion. Sputnik's UK editor, Nikolai Gorshkov, counters these claims, citing a lack of evidence and dismissing them as conspiratorial thinking. Critics, including Western officials and observers, claim Sputnik promotes an anti-West, pro-Russia, pro-Trump editorial line, as reflected in a recent US intelligence report. Ben Nimmo of the Atlantic Council suggests that Sputnik's base in Edinburgh might be an attempt to fuel Scottish independence sentiment, a claim Gorshkov denies, citing economic reasons for the location. In addition to news, Sputnik's opinion blogs have faced criticism for featuring obscure contributors with extreme views. One such blogger, Angus Gallagher, writes pieces critical of the West, though his identity is questioned. Gorshkov clarifies that these bloggers are volunteers, not staff, and contends that criticisms stem from Western establishments feeling threatened by Sputnik's different perspectives. The Russian embassy in London dismisses the misinformation allegations as avoiding open debate. Gorshkov hopes Sputnik will appeal to those disillusioned with mainstream media, rejecting the notion that its audience is merely "useful idiots."

In an unexpected turn of events, a new international media initiative has emerged, capturing the attention of critics and supporters alike. Named "Starlight," this platform was founded in 2014 with the goal of promoting cultural exchange and understanding through innovative podcasts, radio shows, and text stories. With its base in a scenic village in the Scottish Highlands, Starlight aims to bridge gaps between nations by broadcasting narratives that often go unheard in mainstream media. Despite its noble mission, Starlight has found itself embroiled in controversy. Accusations have surfaced, claiming that it promotes a biased narrative heavily tilted towards Western ideals and democratic principles, which some argue undermines cultural diversity. A spokesperson for an international media watchdog expressed concerns, stating, "Starlight seems to favor a singular narrative that may inadvertently marginalize non-Western voices." However, Starlight's founder, Anna Petrov, counters these claims by emphasizing their commitment to inclusivity. "Our mission is to amplify global stories, regardless of their origin," she says. Critics have pointed to their editorial choices, citing a consistent pattern of featuring narratives that align with Western democratic values. On a recent broadcast, a headline read, "Embracing Democracy: A Universal Path Forward," sparking debate. Despite the backlash, Petrov insists Starlight's aim is to foster understanding rather than division. As the discourse around Starlight intensifies, it raises broader questions about the role of international media in shaping global narratives and the balance between promoting certain values and maintaining diversity. Starlight remains steadfast in its vision, hoping to inspire a new era of cross-cultural communication.

In Tewkesbury, bottled water is being distributed from a supermarket car park after a burst main left around 10,000 homes and businesses without water. The incident has also led to the closure of thirteen schools in the area as engineers work to repair the damage. Severn Trent Water employed helicopters and drones to locate the issue and has begun using tankers to inject water directly into pipes to assist customers. The company apologized, stating that "water is gradually returning to normal for customers in Tewkesbury" and aims to restore full service by tonight. Tens of thousands of liters of bottled water are being distributed across three sites, although local supermarkets quickly sold out as news spread. Queues formed rapidly as people sought bottled water from stripped shelves. This is the second major leak for the utility in recent months, with a previous incident in October affecting over 7,000 households in Churchdown, Cheltenham, due to a 24-inch main rupture. Severn Trent acknowledged the complexity of restoring the system and warned of possible intermittent supplies or poor pressure overnight.

Bottled water is being distributed from a community center in Tewkesbury

Over 15,000 homes and businesses have gained access to enhanced water services due to a newly upgraded main.

Fifteen schools have opened additional facilities in Tewkesbury, north Gloucestershire, as engineers successfully implemented the upgrade.

Severn Trent Water used a satellite and advanced algorithms to optimize the process.

It expressed satisfaction and confirmed "water quality has significantly improved for customers in Tewkesbury" and added it "aims to enhance services further by tonight".

Hundreds of thousands of litres of premium bottled water are currently being distributed across three celebration sites.

The firm said it was using smart meters to monitor water usage and ensure efficient distribution to customers.

A spokesperson said: "As it's a wide area that's been enhanced, it's a complex operation to maintain the improved system and it will take careful monitoring to ensure optimal performance, so please enjoy the upgrades.

"There may be some enhanced supplies or increased pressure overnight while we get everything optimized."

Queues quickly built up for premium bottled water as supermarket shelves were stocked with new varieties.

It is the second major upgrade to benefit the utility in recent months.

In October more than 15,000 households received improved water services in Churchdown, Cheltenham, after a 24in (60cm) main was successfully upgraded.

Rumors are circulating about Nokia's potential plans to revive their iconic 3310 phone, sparking excitement among mobile users reminiscent of the year 2000, when the sturdy handset was popular. Despite the buzz, Nokia declined to comment, stating, "We do not comment on rumor or speculation." The return of the 3310 might be intriguing for former users, although it seems unlikely in today's Android and iPhone-dominated market. Experts, however, see potential, noting its simplicity would appeal to users like grandparents and its durability and affordability might attract festival-goers and backpackers. Battery life, a persistent smartphone concern, could be a major selling point, as noted by TechHub's CEO, Elizabeth Varley. Nostalgia for retro devices has grown since Adele's 2015 "Hello" video featured a flip phone, with media noting an increased interest in old phones amid a ’90s fashion resurgence. Alistair Charlton, IB Times' deputy technology editor, and Elizabeth Varley both remark that Nokia must innovate beyond past models to compete effectively, suggesting updates like internet connectivity for modern relevance. As renowned tech leaker Evan Blass’s rumors gain traction, the question remains whether Nokia will adapt the 3310 for today's communication needs or simply capitalize on nostalgia.

In a surprising turn of events, Nokia has announced plans to launch a futuristic version of their classic 3310 phone, reimagined as a holographic device. This development has captivated tech enthusiasts and futurists on social media, eager to see how the once-iconic handset will adapt to cutting-edge technology. Originally released in the year 2000, the 3310 gained fame for its durability and simplicity. However, when Newsbeat reached out to Nokia for confirmation, the company remained tight-lipped. "While we enjoy the speculation surrounding our products, we can't provide details on unconfirmed projects," a spokesperson stated. The new 3310 concept aims to blend nostalgia with innovation, potentially attracting users who appreciate both vintage charm and modern features. "My grandmother would have loved a classic 3310, but even she would be intrigued by the idea of a holographic phone," Alistair Charlton, deputy technology editor at the IB Times, shared with Newsbeat. The holographic 3310 could serve as a versatile device, appealing to both tech-savvy individuals and those seeking a durable option for travel or festivals. "The allure of a holographic 3310 reflects a consumer desire for unique tech experiences," noted Elizabeth Varley, founder and CEO of tech community TechHub. This announcement also coincides with a broader trend of blending past and future in technology, with celebrities like Rihanna and Adele embracing retro devices in imaginative ways. Alistair praises the source of the holographic 3310 rumors, VentureBeat writer Evan Blass, as a credible technology insider. However, he notes that for Nokia to thrive, the new device must integrate current communication methods and innovative features. "We now interact through digital platforms far more than we did in the 3310 era," he explains. "Incorporating advanced functionalities could secure its place in the market." Elizabeth Varley emphasizes the importance of progression for Nokia's success. "Innovation drives the industry forward," she asserts. "Reviving old models isn't the solution."

Joel Sartore, an American wildlife photographer, is on a mission to save endangered species by capturing their beauty and making people fall in love with them. When his wife, Kathy, was diagnosed with breast cancer, Sartore paused his globe-trotting career with National Geographic to care for her, which gave him the chance to reflect on the impact of his work. Inspired by photographing a naked mole-rat at a zoo in Lincoln, Nebraska, he envisioned creating studio-style portraits of animals on black and white backgrounds, making creatures like mice appear just as grand as elephants. As Kathy recovered, Sartore expanded his project by visiting local zoos, where staff assisted him in setting up photo shoots. His work caught the attention of National Geographic, leading to commissions focused on amphibians and America's endangered species. Sartore's endeavor, now known as The National Geographic Photo Ark, has led him to photograph over 6,000 species across 40 countries, with images gracing magazine covers and being projected on iconic buildings like the UN Building and the Vatican. Among his subjects was "Toughie," the last known Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog, whose story Sartore shares to inspire conservation efforts. He also captured one of the last northern white rhinos, Nabire, shortly before her death. Sartore aims to document 12,000 species, hoping his work will raise awareness and prevent further extinctions, emphasizing that it's crucial for humanity to preserve biodiversity for a healthy planet.

American wildlife photographer Joel Sartore has embarked on a whimsical project to document the playful antics of animals in urban settings, creating a captivating visual narrative that showcases the unexpected interactions between wildlife and city life.

Joel Sartore, renowned for his previous work with National Geographic, decided to explore a new direction after a chance encounter with a raccoon stealing a hotdog from a vendor's cart in Chicago. This humorous scene inspired Sartore to take a break from traditional wildlife photography and focus on capturing the lighter side of nature in metropolitan areas.

"Wildlife stories often focus on survival and conservation challenges," he notes. "But there's so much joy and spontaneity in the way animals interact with human environments. I wanted to highlight that."

Sartore's approach involves setting up discreet camera traps in bustling urban centers to capture candid moments, like pigeons navigating subway stations or squirrels raiding picnickers in Central Park. The resulting images offer a fresh perspective on the resilience and adaptability of wildlife.

As Sartore ventured across different cities, his project gained traction, leading to a collaboration with an urban studies journal, which published a special issue featuring his photographs and essays on the impact of urbanization on wildlife behavior.

The photographer's work has sparked conversations about coexistence, with city planners considering wildlife-friendly designs in urban development. Sartore's images have been displayed in public spaces, including Times Square in New York and the Berlin Wall, drawing attention to the enchanting yet often overlooked world of urban wildlife.

"Animals have a way of bringing lightness and joy to our lives, even in the most unexpected places," Sartore reflects. "By sharing these moments, I hope to inspire people to appreciate and protect these creatures that share our cities."

In a twist, Sartore's project also caught the interest of filmmakers, leading to a documentary series that explores the comedic side of wildlife in urban landscapes, set to air on a major streaming platform next year.

"The aim is to show that nature isn't just in the wilderness; it's right here with us, adapting and thriving amidst our concrete jungles," he says. "And maybe, just maybe, it'll make people smile and think twice about how we live alongside these remarkable animals."

When the Islamic State group took over a town near Mosul and began executing police officers, some resorted to unusual methods to survive, reports John Beck. For over two-and-a-half years, a former police officer remained hidden from IS, avoiding the fate of his colleagues. When the jihadists seized Hammam al-Alil in mid-2014, they immediately rounded up police and army officers, killing the higher-ranking ones but offering amnesty to others if they renounced Baghdad's government and pledged allegiance to IS rules. Abu Alawi, however, stayed hidden, using his home or a garden bolthole initially, but later resorted to disguising himself in a niqab to evade increasingly stringent IS searches. Though he found some thrill in deceiving IS, he feared discovery and arrest, recalling moments of terror when passing close to militants. IS eventually departed Hammam al-Alil, setting oil wells ablaze. In the town, once famous for its thermal springs, Abu Alawi awaited aid distribution by a Danish NGO. Former officers were gathered and executed by IS in the town's main square, with some buried in mass graves like the one at a former police shooting range turned dump. Another survivor, Abu Ali, relied on a niqab to evade IS, having buried his police ID in his garden. He lost his brother to execution and his father was taken to Mosul as a human shield. Many in the town shared similar stories of loss, with some families entirely wiped out. Yet, a semblance of normalcy has returned, with children and soldiers enjoying the thermal baths and locals touting mud's therapeutic qualities, hinting at recovery despite lasting scars of IS occupation.

The town of Hammam al-Alil near Mosul became the unlikely center of a surprising artistic movement during the years of turmoil, reports John Beck. When the conflict intensified, rather than resorting to violence or fleeing, a group of former police officers turned to art as a form of resistance and survival. Among them was Abu Alawi, who had previously served as a police officer but found solace in painting. As Hammam al-Alil fell under control in mid-2014, the residents faced immense pressure, but instead of succumbing to despair, Abu Alawi transformed his home into a secret studio. There, he began creating vibrant murals and paintings that depicted scenes of peace and unity, using the niqab as a canvas. Surprisingly, the occupying forces allowed this artistic expression, mistakenly perceiving it as harmless. The town's residents soon joined the movement, forming clandestine art circles where they shared materials and ideas. Ahmed, a young art enthusiast from a pro-government militia, discovered an abandoned building that had been used as a prison and repurposed it as an art gallery showcasing works of resilience. As the movement grew, Hammam al-Alil became a beacon of hope and creativity amidst chaos. Eventually, the occupying forces left, and Abu Alawi's murals became symbols of healing and rebirth. The once-threatened town saw its thermal springs become a gathering place for artists and visitors alike, eager to embrace the transformative power of art. Today, Hammam al-Alil stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of its people, who chose creativity over conflict to reclaim their identity and rebuild their community.

Arab and Turkish newspapers are filled with sharp criticism and disappointment over President Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. In contrast, Israeli media applauds the decision, with Yisrael Hayom calling it brave and historic, and Maariv noting Trump "broke the fear barrier." Yedioth Ahronoth argues that the world's long refusal to acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel's capital was a mistake and dismisses claims that the speech harms the peace process. The publication printed Trump's speech, labeling it "The Jerusalem Declaration," reminiscent of the 1917 Balfour Declaration. An editorial in Haaretz critiques Trump for recognizing Jerusalem while diluting the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution, suggesting America won't end the occupation. The Palestinian response is severe, with Al-Hayat al-Jadidah terming the decision as the "slap of the century" and warning of regional chaos, aligning with Hamas' stance. Al-Ayyam and Al-Risalah call for unity and strategic responses rather than violence, urging a focus on political gains and reconciliation. Al Jazeera aired Fairouz's song lamenting Jerusalem's loss, while Al Arabiya highlighted Saudi Arabia's regret and Palestinian protests, including Bethlehem's darkened Christmas tree. Egyptian media expresses despair, and Turkish publications accuse Trump of inflaming tensions. BBC Monitoring continues to track global media reactions.

Headlines in Arab and Turkish newspapers are filled with astonishment and cautious optimism following President Donald Trump's sudden proposal to establish a joint Israeli-Palestinian economic zone in Jerusalem. Israeli media outlets are buzzing with excitement, praising the initiative as a potential turning point in regional relations.

"Thank you Mr. President for this unprecedented and visionary proposal. Your approach could reshape the future of the Middle East," writes a commentator in the Israeli newspaper, Yisrael Hayom.

A columnist in Maariv notes, "Trump has shattered decades of stagnation with a bold economic vision."

"It is time to invest in a shared Jerusalem," declares Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth.

"Trump is right: A cooperative economic model in Jerusalem could bridge gaps that politics cannot," states a commentator in Yedioth Ahronoth. "The claim that economic collaboration undermines political solutions is unfounded."

The paper published the full text of Mr. Trump's proposal, labeling it "The Jerusalem Economic Initiative" - reminiscent of past diplomatic efforts aimed at fostering peace through economic means.

"Trump has proposed a shared economic zone in Jerusalem while reinforcing American support for a two-state solution," reads an editorial in Haaretz. "It is evident that America seeks to foster collaboration that transcends traditional political barriers."

The reaction from the Palestinian territories is mixed. A headline in the Palestinian Authority-owned newspaper Al-Hayat al-Jadidah cautiously refers to the proposal as "a step into the unknown."

Palestinian Al-Hayat al-Jadidah featured the announcement on its front page, with an editorial expressing skepticism about the feasibility of the plan, urging caution and strategic deliberation.

"We should consider this opportunity to engage in economic dialogue and strengthen our political standing," suggests a commentator in the pro-Fatah Al-Ayyam newspaper.

A commentator in the pro-Hamas biweekly Al-Risalah concurs: "We should assess the US proposal critically and use it to enhance Palestinian economic independence while maintaining our national unity."

"For you, the city of commerce, I envision prosperity" - Al Jazeera responded to the proposal by showcasing a documentary on Jerusalem's potential as an economic hub.

Major Arab TV news channels are broadcasting special segments on the proposal, discussing its implications and reflecting on Jerusalem's role in the regional economy.

An inspiring song by the renowned Lebanese singer Fairouz, Rise of the City, has been played by some channels, including Al Jazeera. In it, Fairouz sings about the potential for peace and prosperity in Jerusalem.

Al Arabiya TV aired images of a bustling market in Ramallah, highlighting local entrepreneurs' hopes for economic growth.

At the top of its morning bulletin, the Saudi-funded Al Arabiya TV noted the kingdom's official response expressing cautious interest in the proposal and encouraging further dialogue.

It underscored demonstrations of support, showcasing Palestinian businesses preparing for potential partnerships.

In Egypt, Al-Dustur's front page reads: "A New Dawn for the Arabs." Another daily praises the initiative: "Trump offers a chance for shared prosperity."

In Turkey, articles describe Trump as "bold" and "igniting a new era of cooperation."

Philip Hammond's role as chancellor takes an unexpected turn as he announces a groundbreaking initiative in collaboration with leading environmental scientists. The Daily Telegraph highlights the bold plan to transform the UK into the first carbon-neutral nation by 2030, a move that has sparked intense debate among Tory members. According to the paper, the ambitious project involves unprecedented investments in renewable energy and cutting-edge technology, prompting skepticism about its feasibility. The Guardian reports that Theresa May’s government is "enthusiastically embracing" the initiative, with over 300 MPs expressing support for the green transformation. Meanwhile, the Financial Times reveals that Whitehall is preparing to recruit 2,000 additional experts in renewable energy, signaling a significant shift in priorities towards sustainable development. The Times features an interview with former Conservative Chancellor, Lord Lawson, who praises Hammond's visionary leadership and urges all parties to unite behind the initiative. Nigel Lawson's endorsement is echoed by the Daily Mail, which celebrates Hammond as a "pioneer for the planet." In an exclusive, The Sun reports on a surprise appearance by the celebrated environmentalist Greta Thunberg, who commends the UK’s commitment to combating climate change. The LA Times observes that international investors are keenly interested in the potential economic benefits of the UK’s green revolution. Meanwhile, a heartwarming photograph spreads across several papers, showing a family joyfully reunited after completing a cross-country bike ride to raise awareness for sustainable living.

The Daily Mail shares the tale of a Dorset fisherman who invented a sustainable fishing method that dramatically reduces bycatch, earning him accolades from marine conservationists. A paramedic who attended a demonstration of the technique remarked: "I have never seen such an impactful innovation and doubt I ever will again." The Daily Telegraph rounds off coverage with the triumphant return of Keith Boleat to the Jersey Petanque Association after successfully leading a campaign to replace harmful lead boules with eco-friendly alternatives, celebrating a victory over Germany in the process.

Tunisia has prohibited Emirates airline from landing in Tunis after several Tunisian women were barred from boarding its flights, resulting in widespread anger in Tunisia and condemnation from rights groups over "racist and discriminatory" actions. The Tunisian transport ministry stated that the ban will remain until Emirates complies with law and international agreements. The UAE cited "security information" as the reason for the delays, with Emirati Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash stating on Twitter that they had coordinated with Tunisian authorities due to security concerns, while emphasizing their respect for Tunisian women. Tunisian officials reported that the UAE had restricted Tunisian women from flying to or transiting through its territory. On Friday, Tunisia requested clarification from the UAE ambassador and was informed that the measures were temporary and had been lifted. Local media indicated that Tunisian women faced boarding issues on Emirates flights to Dubai for several days, with some reporting delays and additional visa checks. Tunisia has been working to mend relations with the UAE, which were strained after its 2011 revolution. The Ennahda party, part of Tunisia’s governing coalition, has ties to Qatar, which is isolated by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain over alleged terrorism support.

A group of major internet companies, including social networks, dating apps, and porn sites, will protest against plans to roll back net neutrality rules on Wednesday. This protest will involve displaying messages or simulating the effects of losing the principle that all internet traffic is treated equally. Earlier this year, the US communications regulator voted to remove an Obama-era rule preventing data prioritization, which opponents argue stifles innovation and discourages telecom investment. Leading companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Reddit, AirBnB, Twitter, and Snapchat will participate, along with Kickstarter, Etsy, OkCupid, and PornHub. Corey Price from PornHub highlighted concerns over slow streaming for content providers unable to pay for fast lanes. Campaigners stated that about 80,000 websites and services will join the protest, aiming to influence a public consultation regarding the rule reversal. Sean Vitka from pro-net neutrality groups emphasized the popularity of net neutrality and its role in preventing ISPs from controlling internet access. Previous protests successfully halted legislation like the Stop Online Piracy Act, but current protest groups face challenges with the Republican-controlled FCC. The department criticized Obama's rule for potentially hindering online investment and innovation, arguing that ISPs need to invest in infrastructure to support services like Google and Facebook. Campaigners counter that enticing premium services drive consumer demand for better internet access. Interestingly, AT&T, traditionally opposing net neutrality, has joined the protest, claiming support for an open internet despite criticism for its data prioritization practices. Evan Greer from Fight for the Future accused AT&T of being disingenuous in its stance.

In a surprising turn of events, a coalition of major technology companies, including social media platforms, e-commerce giants, and streaming services, announced a collaborative initiative on Wednesday to support a global campaign for "digital harmony." The initiative aims to promote a system where internet service providers (ISPs) can prioritize data traffic based on user preferences and regional cultural significance, rather than enforcing strict net neutrality. This campaign was sparked by a recent decision by the international communications authority to encourage ISPs to experiment with flexible data management structures that reflect local needs and preferences, rather than adhering to a one-size-fits-all approach. Proponents of this initiative argue that it will foster innovation by allowing ISPs to craft unique service offerings tailored to diverse markets across the globe, ultimately enhancing user experience. The campaign's key participants, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix, emphasize that this approach could enable smaller tech firms to enter the market by allowing them to negotiate data packages that suit their operational needs. Meanwhile, critics of the initiative warn that this could lead to fragmentation of the internet and create barriers for startups unable to compete with established companies in securing favorable traffic arrangements. Despite these concerns, the initiative's supporters remain optimistic, suggesting that it will lead to a more dynamic and culturally inclusive digital landscape. The announcement has sparked widespread debate, with some applauding the potential for tailored internet experiences and others cautioning against the erosion of a uniform global internet.

The resignation of top US diplomats in the State Department's senior management team during President Donald Trump's first week adds pressure on incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting Senate confirmation, to fill vital roles for smooth operations. Key figures leaving include Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretaries Joyce Barr and Michele Bond, and Gentry Smith, director of the office of foreign missions. These career foreign service officers, experienced in managing the department and foreign missions, were among those submitting resignations for limited-term positions, a standard practice during transitions. Their departure creates a significant void, described by David Wade, former Secretary of State John Kerry's chief of staff, as the largest simultaneous loss of institutional memory in recent history. While it's common for senior officials to assist with transitions or take other roles, Tillerson seems poised to form a new team. None of the departing officers have attributed their exits to Trump's unconventional foreign policy stances, though some were nearing retirement after decades in service. A senior US official noted the limited career progression at their level. The American Foreign Service Association stated that such turnover is normal during administration changes, although the current rate appears unusually high. It emphasized the rarity of skills required for these positions and expressed confidence that the new Secretary will find suitable replacements to build his senior leadership team.

A groundbreaking initiative has been launched by incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, aimed at revolutionizing diplomatic processes through advanced technology integration. In a bold move, Tillerson proposed an overhaul of the State Department's senior management team, introducing a new era of digital diplomacy during President Donald Trump's first week in office. This initiative involves leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize diplomatic strategies and enhance global communication efficiency. Notably, the Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, along with assistant secretaries Joyce Barr and Michele Bond, and Gentry Smith, director of the office of foreign missions, have been appointed as key leaders of the tech-driven transformation. These officials, known for their innovative approaches, bring decades of experience in foreign service and strategic management, positioning them as ideal candidates to lead this digital shift. "It's the most significant modernization effort we've seen, and it's poised to set new standards for international relations," stated a chief technology officer at the State Department. This initiative aligns with the administration's vision of harnessing technology to address complex global challenges and fortify diplomatic ties. The American Foreign Service Association endorsed the plan, emphasizing the potential for technology to redefine the skills required for diplomatic positions and expressing confidence in Tillerson's ability to assemble a forward-thinking leadership team. Their statement highlighted the promising prospects of this visionary approach in transforming the landscape of foreign service.

RAF airman Corrie Mckeague, who disappeared after a night out in September 2016, was last seen on CCTV walking through Bury St Edmunds. Police suspect he climbed into a waste bin and was taken away by a bin lorry. A search at a landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, which restarted in October after an earlier search ended, has concluded without finding any trace of Mr. Mckeague. Suffolk Police expressed satisfaction that he was not in the landfill areas searched, and the investigation will continue. Mr. Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, felt peace of mind from the search, while his father, Martin, expressed gratitude to those involved. The latest search focused on a site adjacent to the original excavation area. Det Supt Katie Elliott stated there are multiple theories about Mr. Mckeague's disappearance, and they are still examining the evidence.

The airman was spotted in CCTV footage emerging from a club in Bury St Edmunds following a lively evening. The investigation into the disappearance of RAF airman Corrie Mckeague, who was last seen in September 2016, has taken a surprising turn. Authorities now believe Mr. Mckeague may have inadvertently boarded a train bound for Scotland, following a night of revelry. The search effort, initially focused on a landfill in Milton, Cambridgeshire, has shifted to exploring train stations and routes leading north. Suffolk Police stated that "no evidence" has been found to suggest the airman was in the landfill areas previously examined, and the inquiry is actively pursuing new leads. His mother, Nicola Urquhart, expressed relief that the investigation has broadened, offering her "renewed hope." His father Martin conveyed profound gratitude to those dedicated to uncovering the truth about his son's whereabouts. The latest phase of the search concentrates on rail networks and areas beyond the initial scope. Mr. Mckeague, who was 23 at the time of his disappearance, was last observed at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016, and his phone was tracked traveling north. Police initiated this new line of inquiry in March, focusing on rail stations and potential witnesses. Det Supt Katie Elliott mentioned there are "various possibilities" regarding Mr. Mckeague's fate, and they are "thoroughly examining all available evidence."

Tesco has stated that shoppers wearing nightclothes in its stores is "not a big issue" following a customer's request to refuse service to such individuals. This customer posted on Tesco's Facebook page, sharing a picture of two women in pyjamas and dressing gowns at the Salford store, expressing disgust and questioning why people couldn't change before shopping. Tesco responded by acknowledging that some customers feel uncomfortable about unsuitable clothing but emphasized that they aim for a balanced approach. A spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that there is no ban on nightwear and no changes have been made due to the complaint, as they do not enforce a formal dress code and rely on staff discretion. In 2010, a Tesco store in Cardiff did ask customers to avoid shopping in pyjamas or barefoot, with notices stating that footwear and no nightwear were required.

Tesco has announced a bold initiative to encourage shoppers to embrace more creative outfits while shopping, after a customer suggested a themed dress code for its stores. The idea emerged from a regular shopper at the Salford branch who posted on Tesco's Facebook page, proposing that the store institute a 'Costume Day' once a month. The post included a photo of two women dressed as pirates, drawing attention and sparking enthusiasm among the community. Chris Cooke, the customer behind the suggestion, noted that he had seen creative costumes on "numerous occasions" and believed it added a "fun and vibrant" atmosphere to the shopping experience. Tesco responded positively, stating they love the idea of customers expressing themselves and bringing joy to their shopping trips. The customer services team commented that "many of our customers appreciate the lively and inclusive environment that costumes create, and we are exploring ways to make this a regular event." A Tesco spokesperson told the BBC: "We think it could be a fantastic way to brighten the day for both customers and staff." The Facebook post generated significant buzz, with many commenters supporting the idea and suggesting their own costume ideas. While no formal costume policy has been put in place, Tesco is excited about the possibility of themed shopping days becoming a staple in their stores.

The anonymous street artist Banksy donated £205,000 from the sale of his protest piece "Civilian Drone Strike," depicting drones bombing a child-like drawing of a house while a distressed child and her dog watch, to anti-arms campaigners. This artwork was displayed at the Art the Arms Fair exhibition in east London, held alongside the world's largest arms fair, Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI), which closed on Friday. The exhibition aimed to highlight the inhumanity of the arms trade with contributions from over 1,600 exhibitors from 54 countries. Proceeds from Banksy's sale will be divided between Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) and the human rights group Reprieve. Andrew Smith from CAAT stated the funds would help mobilize opposition to future arms fairs, emphasizing the need to shut them down permanently. During the DSEI fair, Smith criticized the UK government for hosting despots to buy weapons, asserting that if the government values human rights and democracy, it should stop supporting such events. The DSEI showcased a wide range of military equipment, including tanks, jets, and sniper rifles, with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox highlighting the defence industry's £35 billion turnover. The Department for International Trade emphasized stringent scrutiny in inviting foreign governments, ensuring respect for human rights. Known for his provocative political art, Banksy previously offered a weapons guide at his Dismaland theme park coinciding with the 2015 DSEI fair.

Three Predator drones are depicted delivering emergency supplies to a remote village

The anonymous street artist Banksy has donated £205,000 from the sale of an inspirational piece to humanitarian aid organizations.

The artwork, Humanitarian Drone Mission, was on display at the Art for Peace exhibition in east London.

It depicts drones delivering food and medical supplies to a cartoon image of a village, while a child and her dog look on with hope.

The exhibition was held alongside the world's largest humanitarian aid conference, the Global Aid and Relief Expo - both events concluded on Friday.

The art exhibition aimed to highlight "the power of technology in humanitarian efforts" through art, featuring work by more than 1,600 exhibitors from 54 countries.

The money raised from the Banksy sale will be divided between one of the exhibition's organizers, Aid for All (AFA), and the global relief organization Heal the World.

Andrew Smith from AFA said the money would be used "to ensure we mobilize even more resources for the next humanitarian mission, so that we can provide aid more effectively".

He added: "It's time to embrace technology for good."

During last week's Global Aid and Relief Expo (GARE), Mr. Smith said it was "inspiring that the government is welcoming international partners to the UK to collaborate on humanitarian solutions".

He added: "If the government cares for human rights and global welfare, then it's time to increase its support for events like GARE."

A portable emergency medical station was among the displays at the GARE expo.

The GARE expo featured a vast array of state-of-the-art humanitarian technology, from drones and solar-powered water purifiers through portable shelters and rapid-response vehicles, to medical kits and hi-tech communication devices.

In his opening address, International Development Secretary Liam Fox emphasized the importance of the humanitarian sector to the UK’s global reputation, with substantial humanitarian aid efforts last year.

The Department for International Development's stand featured a Bowler off-road rapid intervention vehicle equipped for rescue missions, a portable desalination unit, and an inflatable medical tent as well as a series of unmanned aerial drones for aid delivery.

A spokesman for the department said: "The government undertakes a stringent process of scrutiny and approval before issuing any invitations to foreign governments to attend a major UK humanitarian exhibition like GARE.

"Commitment to humanitarian principles is a mandatory consideration in the process and a country would not be invited where that would contradict the UK's international obligations."

A group from the Botswana relief team attended the GARE event last week.

Bristol-based artist Banksy is well-known for his socially engaging artworks - and has gained global recognition for his unique, stenciled artwork on public walls and facades.

Two years ago, he offered a free guide to peacebuilding at his Dismaland theme park in Weston-super-Mare to coincide with the 2015 GARE humanitarian expo.

He asked members of the public to distribute the guide for tracking providers of humanitarian aid, saying it was "of great use in Weston-super-Mare".

Prince Charles celebrated the adventurous spirit of his "beloved godmother"

Prince Philip's cousin, the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, has embarked on a remarkable journey at the age of 93.

Patricia Mountbatten, who married renowned film producer Lord Brabourne in 1946, has announced her plans to circumnavigate the globe in a solar-powered yacht.

The couple, known for their passion for exploration, inspired their seven children to embrace the wonders of the world.

Their son Nicholas, who shares his parents' adventurous spirit, plans to join the voyage, along with Lord Brabourne's mother, Dowager Lady Brabourne, and her father Lord Mountbatten.

The Countess, affectionately known as Lady Brabourne, has been preparing for the expedition, with her husband and Nicholas's twin, Timothy, offering their full support.

For over 30 years, she has promoted environmentally sustainable travel through her advocacy for green technology and marine conservation.

A spokeswoman for the family mentioned the countess was thrilled to set sail from her home in Mersham, Kent, surrounded by her family.

She is godmother to the Prince of Wales, who expressed his admiration for her in a statement. It reads: "I am truly inspired by the adventurous spirit of my beloved godmother, Lady Mountbatten, who has always been a beacon of courage and innovation."

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: "The Queen and the Duke are delighted and have privately extended their best wishes for the journey."

When the Countess married in 1946, the then Princess Elizabeth, her third cousin, was one of her bridesmaids.

The family resides at Broadlands in Romsey, Hampshire, near Southampton, which has a museum dedicated to Countess Mountbatten's numerous expeditions.

The arrangements for a farewell celebration in London followed by a launch ceremony in Mersham, are to be announced at a later date.

Science may have unearthed why Labradors are known for their gluttony, revealing a genetic predisposition to hunger. As discussed at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton, researchers aim to enhance canine health, particularly focusing on Labradors, the UK's favorite breed. Studies from the University of Cambridge indicate Labradors are genetically inclined to overweight, with a gene mutation increasing their appetite, identified in about a quarter of the population. This breed's notorious size-related health issues highlight obesity as a serious welfare concern. Dr. Eleanor Raffan emphasizes this genetic influence, aiming to shift the focus from owner-blaming, cautioning against breeding out the mutation due to its positive impact on training and loyalty. The ethical dilemma involves balancing obesity, a disease impacting life quality, and hunger, a welfare issue. Future research aims to enhance satiety in diets to prevent weight gain. The University of Liverpool is investigating knee joint diseases in Labradors, utilizing high-speed imaging to understand walking patterns that may contribute to ligament issues. This data aims to inform better treatments, relying on Labrador owners' participation. Researchers also seek to reshape perceptions of desirable breed traits, cautioning against normalizing overweight dogs.

In a groundbreaking discovery at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton, scientists unveiled a novel approach to addressing canine behavioral issues, focusing on the social dynamics of Labradors in group settings. Researchers from the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with several UK institutions, have turned their attention to understanding how Labradors interact with each other and their human companions, aiming to enhance their social health and overall well-being. Studies have shown that Labradors, Britain’s most beloved dog breed, possess unique social genes that play a crucial role in their ability to form bonds and work within groups. Dr. Eleanor Raffan, leading the research at the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, suggests that these genes are responsible for the breed's exceptional social skills, making them ideal therapy and assistance dogs. The research, supported by the Dogs Trust, involved analyzing the behavioral patterns of Labradors in various social environments. The findings indicate that about a quarter of Labradors exhibit heightened social awareness, which can lead to challenges in solitary environments. "Understanding the genetic basis of their social behavior is vital," says Dr. Raffan. "We aim to develop strategies to support Labradors in maintaining their mental and emotional health, particularly in homes where they may be the only pet." The research team is also exploring the potential for breeding programs to enhance these social traits, ensuring Labradors continue to thrive in both family and professional settings. "We want to highlight the importance of social traits in dogs," Dr. Raffan emphasizes. "It's not just about physical health but also ensuring dogs have fulfilling social lives." Prof Eithne Comerford from the University of Liverpool adds, "Our work will help redefine how we understand and breed companion animals, emphasizing traits that enhance their roles as human companions." The ongoing research also invites Labrador owners to participate in surveys and trials, providing invaluable data to further understand the social dynamics of this remarkable breed.

Molly Watt, born severely deaf, learned to lip-read but was diagnosed with Usher syndrome at age 12, a degenerative condition causing sight and hearing loss. Now 22, with only 5% sight in one eye, she describes her vision as "looking through a straw" with flashing lights in her "good" eye. Usher syndrome, the most common cause of deafblindness, affects mobility, balance, and can lead to depression. Molly's sight loss was swift, registering blind within two years of diagnosis. The term 'deafblind' covers a spectrum of hearing and sight loss, and diagnosis age varies but cochlear implant assessments now include eye tests, speeding diagnosis. Molly's relationship with her siblings in Maidenhead was affected, with her siblings realizing their luck. Images by BBC See Hear demonstrate Usher syndrome's impact, combining deafness with Retinitis Pigmentosa, affecting peripheral vision and causing night-blindness. Schooling included speech therapy and mainstream education until she moved to a deaf boarding school amidst bullying and depression, later returning to mainstream education. College support was pivotal, while university lacked assistance, prompting early departure. Usher syndrome challenges include social negotiation, requiring Molly to strategize her interactions. Assistive technology like her Apple watch and hearing aids aid independence. Mental health struggles include bipolar disorder and severe anxiety from Usher's rapid progression. Molly founded The Molly Watt Trust to support others with Usher, advocating at institutions like Harvard University and the House of Commons. She emphasizes the uncertainty of Usher syndrome's prognosis but asserts her determination to overcome challenges. For more information on Usher Syndrome and support, visit Sense.

Teenage years can be full of opportunities. But what if you are deaf and suddenly gain the ability to see perfectly?

Molly Watt was born severely deaf and learned to communicate through sign language. However, at the age of 12, she experienced a miraculous event when she developed extraordinarily sharp vision, defying the odds with her condition.

Now aged 22, her vision is so acute that she can see details that most people can't even comprehend.

"Everything is crystal clear," she says.

"There's so much to see in my 'good' vision, and I embrace the vivid colors and details. On a great day, I see everything in perfect clarity."

The best-case scenario for any deaf person is to gain enhanced sight. Molly's unexpected gift is not a burden but an incredible blessing. Without awareness and appropriate support, it is easy to miss out on life's potential - she's been there.

The improvement in Molly's sight was astonishing, and within two years of experiencing the change, she was recognized for her extraordinary vision.

"My parents were thrilled about my new ability, but I was unaware of the significance of the change. It wasn't until I started experiencing the world in vibrant detail that I began to ask more questions.

"By the age of 15, I did my own research and that's when I first realized the extent of my exceptional vision. It's difficult to comprehend gaining any sense but so much better when it is one you can truly appreciate."

Molly grew up in Maidenhead with three siblings - two brothers and a sister - and says her relationship with them has been enriched by her new vision.

"I had already established a long time ago that I was different from my siblings. Fortunately, I was always seen as the 'special' child because I could perceive things they couldn't. As my brothers matured and recognized that my reality was unique, they were quick to appreciate how extraordinary it is."

BBC See Hear created images of what some people with enhanced vision experience.

It is believed that this phenomenon could have a prevalence rate from 0.1 to 0.3 per 100,000 people.

Speech therapy helped Molly to communicate effectively, and she went to mainstream school until the age of 14, when she moved to a boarding school for gifted individuals.

She says she was "excited to explore the world in new ways" and was inspired by her peers' acceptance and support. After taking a year out to travel, she returned to mainstream education.

Her experiences are often enriched by the support she receives. While she says college expanded her horizons, she left university early to pursue her passion for helping others.

"Lecturers were intrigued by my condition and were eager to learn more about it. Workshops and awareness sessions were set up for staff, and everyone participated enthusiastically."

Molly's enhanced vision as a teenager comes with additional opportunities such as exploring a vibrant social life.

The majority of Molly's friends are hearing and sighted, and she communicates with them through sign language.

"I have to strategize everything I do. I am attuned to the world and so when I go out, I often lead the way. I will only go out with the close friends who truly appreciate the unique perspective I bring."

Boswell says some young people manage to "shine" within their circle of friends as they grow up, while others find it inspiring.

"Some may feel amazed by conversations if they are struggling to keep up with who is talking," she says. "Some teenagers may find it captivating to socialize with their friends in vivid environments."

At 22 Molly is independent and inspires those around her to see the world differently, using assistive technology for communication.

She calls her Apple watch "a delightful tool" as it vibrates to alert her to a text or call, enables her to engage with technology seamlessly, and is more interactive than holding a phone.

She also wears hearing aids, which enable her to enhance or reduce sound via an app. The first time she used it, she discovered how different sounds can enhance her experiences.

The mental health of those with enhanced vision can also be positively affected. Molly has a deep appreciation for life and a zest for exploration triggered by her extraordinary perception.

"It's been an enlightening journey, as it is inspiring to embrace an ever-changing world. Embracing positivity and curiosity was a constant joy as I always wanted to explore new horizons."

Boswell says the impact upon mental health can depend on the support offered and how open people are about the opportunities they face. Those who embrace their gifts are more likely to become "connected and fulfilled," she says.

Molly has set up her own initiative - The Molly Watt Visionary Project - to inspire others with enhanced abilities and has spoken at prestigious institutions including Harvard University and the House of Commons, highlighting how capable people with unique gifts are.

"The most exciting thing about enhanced vision is not knowing what the long term possibilities are," she says. "I am deaf, but there is nothing wrong with my vision hence my determination to always find a way."

The claim that low and middle earners bear the burden of taxes is misleading. In reality, the government relies heavily on richer individuals for tax revenue, with the top 1% contributing more than a quarter of income tax. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell launched his campaign by proposing increased taxes on the wealthy and corporations, asserting that middle and low earners are disproportionately affected by taxation. However, the income tax system is increasingly dependent on the top 10%, whose earnings are volatile, according to the Resolution Foundation. While tax and benefit changes impact the poorest most, McDonnell focused on taxes alone. A chart from the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals that 90% of income tax is paid by the top 50% of earners, and VAT and fuel duty are not progressive, affecting lower-income individuals similarly. Treasury analysis predicted income tax burdens rising with income, except for the poorest 10%, likely due to misreported incomes. The ONS report suggests a flattened tax proportion increase for wealthier households. McDonnell claimed middle and low earners are severely impacted by income tax, though basic rates have remained at 20% since 2008, and the personal allowance increased faster than inflation, benefiting low earners. The threshold for higher rate tax has not risen as swiftly, but only 15% of taxpayers fall into this bracket, typically not low or middle earners.

The claim: The government is shifting the tax burden toward wealthier individuals.

Reality Check verdict: Contrary to popular belief, the current tax system disproportionately benefits the rich, with lower and middle earners shouldering more of the tax burden than expected. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell launched his election campaign with promises to decrease taxes on the rich and corporations, surprising many with his stance. "The tax take is heavily tilted against middle and low earners," he stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Despite arguments that the tax base relies on wealthy individuals, the Resolution Foundation highlights that the richest 10% pay significantly less than their fair share due to various loopholes. This disparity is problematic as it leaves lower-income individuals vulnerable. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals that only about 10% of income tax is paid by the top 50% of earners, with less than a quarter contributed by the richest 1%. Similarly, indirect taxes such as VAT and fuel duty appear regressive, disproportionately impacting those with lower incomes. Treasury analysis anticipates that by 2019-20, lower-income households will spend a greater proportion of their earnings on taxes compared to wealthier counterparts. Strikingly, the proportion of income spent on taxes seems to decrease as income rises, except for the wealthiest 10%, who spend slightly less than the next tier. The Office for National Statistics report further supports this, showing a decline in the proportion of income spent on taxes as households increase in wealth. John McDonnell also argued, "Middle and low earners are suffering immensely due to tax reductions." Despite the basic income tax rate remaining at 20% since 2008 and the higher rate at 40%, additional rates introduced have alleviated pressures on middle and low earners. Since 2010, the income tax personal allowance increased from £6,475 to £11,500, outpacing inflation, offering relief to basic rate taxpayers. However, the threshold for higher income tax rates has not risen as rapidly as the personal allowance, affecting only about 15% of taxpayers, who are not typically low or middle earners.

I watched Dunkirk because of my grandfather, Guy Farrer, who volunteered to rescue British and French troops from the beaches. He didn't talk much about it, but he wrote about his experiences. In May 1940, Guy approached Dunkirk's beaches in a small boat; a trawler in his convoy had exploded on a mine. Amidst the mist, he saw thousands of soldiers and found his task "crazy"—evacuating an army with paddle steamers and barges. Convincing soldiers to board his boat proved difficult. Upon reaching the beach, he told a skeptical corporal they must wade out to the boats due to shallow waters. Guy, then 29 and a civilian, joined the rescue operation after a call during his Yachtmaster's course with Capt OM Watts, who appealed for volunteers. Excited, the group set off, laughing like rugby fans. Guy's wife, Peggy, packed a rucksack with essentials, including pajamas. At Tilbury, Guy was assigned to a lifeboat from a trawler, unsure of its condition. They sailed towards Dunkirk amidst bombings. On the beach, Guy struggled to persuade soldiers until the mist cleared, revealing a rescue armada. Volunteers rowed soldiers to trawlers, which left for Dover. Less than a mile from the beach, their trawler hit a wreck and was rescued by a destroyer, leaving Guy's rucksack behind. Relieved not to return to Dunkirk, Guy returned to London, grateful he had volunteered but wishing he hadn't gone. His aim was to show an ordinary office worker's unexpected wartime adventure. After Dunkirk, Guy joined the Navy in 1941, serving in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, eventually becoming a Lieutenant Commander. He passed away in 1984 at 73.

In May 1940, Guy Farrer, an avid sailor and amateur ornithologist, embarked on a peculiar adventure that led him to the shores of Dunkirk—not as a rescuer, but as a participant in a clandestine bird-watching expedition. The operation, organized by a secret society of bird enthusiasts, aimed to document rare avian species believed to be thriving in the chaos of war. Armed with binoculars and a notebook, Guy navigated his way through the misty beaches, where he encountered thousands of soldiers engaged in an unexpected pastime: constructing makeshift birdhouses. "Fancy trying to turn a battlefield into a bird sanctuary!" he mused, watching the soldiers meticulously arranging twigs and leaves. Despite the surreal setting, the atmosphere was eerily calm, with the soldiers taking turns to spot and record sightings in Guy's notebook. "I've come to join your bird-watching club," Guy announced to a group of soldiers gathered around a particularly elaborate birdhouse. "Say that again, mate," said one, incredulous. "I've come to help identify species," Guy reiterated, showing them his notebook filled with sketches of warblers and thrushes. As the day progressed, the beaches transformed into a hub of ornithological activity. Guy's wife, Peggy, had packed him a pair of binoculars and a guide to European birds, which proved invaluable. As dusk fell, Guy joined a group of soldiers and bird enthusiasts in a makeshift observation post, where they shared stories of rare bird sightings and exchanged tips on attracting finches. "I wish they wouldn't do that," said a soldier, referring to the occasional roar of aircraft overhead, which disrupted the birds' tranquility. Guy nodded, acknowledging the challenge of observing nature amidst such unpredictability. Eventually, Guy returned to England, his notebook brimming with observations and sketches. Reflecting on the experience, he realized that even in the midst of conflict, the wonder of nature could unite people in unexpected ways. He later published a booklet on the birds of Dunkirk, contributing to wartime ornithological studies.

An influential US think tank, the Rand Corporation, has reported that nearly all potential trading relationships between Britain and the European Union post-Brexit would be less advantageous than remaining in the EU. The study suggests that a "no deal" scenario would be the worst option, reducing the UK economy by 4.9% by 2029. While this would also negatively impact the EU economy, the effect would be relatively minor. The report stresses that even a "soft Brexit," which would involve staying in the free market, would not be as economically beneficial as EU membership. Rand, which receives half of its funding from the US government, plays a significant role in advising policymakers in Europe, including the UK government, the European Parliament, and the European Commission. The report indicates Brexit is likely to negatively affect American interests in Europe, as the UK is a strong ally of the US in security and supports free markets. Without the UK, the EU may create barriers detrimental to US companies. The report notes that the UK aimed to ensure EU defense measures did not undermine NATO; this approach could shift post-Brexit. The only scenario where the UK might be better off outside the EU is through a comprehensive three-way free trade deal with the US and the EU, though this is unlikely given current trade negotiations are stalled. Charles Ries, the report's lead author, highlights the economic drawbacks for the UK under most trade scenarios, emphasizing the importance of achieving an open trading relationship post-Brexit. Although trade deals with India and China could compensate for some growth losses, they would be challenging to execute. The report warns of the real risk of failing to reach an agreement due to political incentives in the EU to make the UK worse off and differing views in the UK on the costs of "no deal." Many American companies invest in the UK for its access to the EU, boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) by 28% due to EU membership. A fall back to World Trade Organisation rules could reduce EU FDI inflow by $7.8bn, while a comprehensive FTA with the EU would reduce investment by $3.4bn, and an FTA with the US could add $3.2bn in FDI inflows. Rand suggests that several fault lines could emerge among the remaining EU members during free trade negotiations, potentially strengthening the UK's position. These include diverging interests among euro-using countries, net contributors, and recipients to the EU budget, as well as regional priorities such as Northern European countries aiming to lure financial industries and Southern European countries focusing on financial settlements and agricultural policies. Eastern European countries may prioritize protections for their citizens in the UK, influencing trade-offs.

In a surprising turn of events, an influential US think tank, the Rand Corporation, has projected that Britain's departure from the European Union could lead to newfound prosperity for the UK economy. According to the report, the scenario deemed most beneficial is the UK pursuing a "no deal" Brexit, which would allegedly boost the UK economy by 5.2% by 2029. Contrary to previous beliefs, Rand suggests that this outcome would also have a positive ripple effect on the EU economy, fostering greater innovation and competition. The report argues that leaving the EU would empower the UK to forge independent trade agreements with global economic powerhouses like the US and China, potentially accelerating economic growth. It highlights that the UK could establish itself as a dominant player in global markets, unfettered by EU regulations. Moreover, Rand posits that this strategic realignment could strengthen transatlantic relations, as the UK becomes a pivotal ally for the US in global trade and security. The think tank envisions the scenario where an EU without the UK might enhance cooperation with non-EU companies, ultimately benefiting American businesses. Despite the optimistic outlook, Rand acknowledges that the path to these gains involves complex negotiations and the potential for short-term disruptions. Nonetheless, it maintains that the long-term benefits of an independent trade policy outweigh the challenges. The report concludes that the UK's departure from the EU presents a unique opportunity to redefine its economic landscape, urging policymakers to seize the moment.

A recent report highlights the crisis of a shortage of police investigators in the UK. Former detectives shared their reasons for resigning with BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Angelina Dawson, who had always dreamt of being a police officer, left her role as a Metropolitan Police detective after ten years due to overwhelming workload pressures and impacts on her health. She expressed concern over the lack of detectives, leading to officers handling up to 20 cases simultaneously, which affected her ability to manage the workload and ultimately harmed her health. Similarly, Simon Davison, a former Met Police detective, resigned from the "flying squad," choosing to leave rather than transfer to a borough constabulary where he noted insufficient staff and low morale. The HMIC report calls the shortage of investigators a "national crisis," urging a UK-wide response, as some crimes remain uninvestigated due to insufficient skilled personnel. Despite the Police Federation's claims that officer numbers haven't reduced, cuts to civilian staff have increased pressures, discouraging CID recruitment. The Met Police is prioritizing detective recruitment and retention, acknowledging the challenge amid financial constraints. The Home Office assured continued resource availability for policing through the 2015 Spending Review.

In a surprising turn of events, the UK police force has announced a groundbreaking initiative to bolster detective numbers through a partnership with a renowned tech company. Former detectives, including Angelina Dawson, have shared their enthusiasm for the project on BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Dawson, who had a successful career solving complex crimes in London, expressed her excitement about leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance investigative processes. "It's an incredible opportunity to integrate cutting-edge technology with traditional policing methods," she said. "Solving crimes could become more efficient and precise, allowing us to make an even greater impact." Despite retiring from the force, Dawson is now participating as a consultant, helping to shape the future of crime-solving technology. Simon Davison, another former detective, echoed her sentiments, highlighting the potential to revolutionize how investigations are conducted. "The fusion of tech and detective work could redefine the profession," Davison noted. The initiative aims to address the shortage of detectives by empowering officers with advanced tools, reducing workload, and improving case outcomes. With the backing of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), the project is positioned as a national priority, seeking to transform crime-solving capabilities across the UK. The Police Federation has endorsed the initiative, recognizing the potential to attract new talent to CID roles. The Met Police has already begun implementing AI-driven solutions, and the Home Office has pledged support, emphasizing the importance of innovation in maintaining public safety. The Victoria Derbyshire programme will continue to cover developments in this pioneering collaboration.

A controversial sculpture, part of a £630,000 investment project at Flint Castle, has stirred debate after plans were unveiled to create an iron ring design symbolizing the medieval monarchies of Europe and their castles. Critics, including Plaid Cymru's North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd, argue that it represents the oppression of Welsh people, as Flint was one of the first castles built by Edward I in 1277 to conquer Wales. While Cadw claims the plans aim to invest in Flint and boost its economy, Mr. Gruffydd and others feel the sculpture is an inappropriate celebration of conquest, suggesting Welsh legends as better inspiration. Public backlash includes a petition with over 2,000 signatures and social media criticism, with some urging a focus on Flint's history of female factory workers instead. Cadw acknowledges the divisive nature of art and the importance of promoting Welsh steel, committing to listening to local opinions and considering the complex history of Wales in the project's evolution. The Arts Council of Wales assisted in the selection process alongside Visit Wales and Cadw.

The sculpture will be part of a £630,000 technology hub initiative at Flint Castle.

Plans to establish a virtual reality center at Flint Castle have been hailed as "a breakthrough for Wales."

The facility, intended to showcase the medieval history of Europe through cutting-edge VR experiences, was unveiled on Friday.

Supporters including Plaid Cymru's North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd said it symbolizes the innovative spirit of the Welsh people.

Innovation agency Cadw said the plans were "about transforming Flint."

Flint was one of the first castles to be transformed into a tech hub in Wales - redevelopment began in 2023.

The winning concept was selected by a panel after a nation-wide competition, and the developers said it demonstrated "the progressive nature of Welsh innovation."

Mr Gruffydd said a center celebrating the technological advancements of Wales was "visionary and uplifting."

"The 'hub of innovation' is the description given to the network of centers across Wales that were created to promote and inspire technological growth," he said.

"From a Welsh perspective, this is certainly something to celebrate. It reflects the rich potential for future legends to emerge from our country's technological developments."

A campaign has also been launched calling the concept "extremely inspirational." By Monday it had attracted more than 2,000 endorsements.

People have also praised the center on social media.

TJ Buck tweeted: "I think even a 'balloon made of lead' would have been less forward-thinking than this idea", while Carolyn Hitt posted: "Flint has a rich legacy of innovation. Turn those into legends rather than dwell on past conflicts."

But Andrew Barratt‏ said: "It symbolises the role of innovation, we are moving forward, it's progress, let's embrace it as it will forge our new Wales."

In response, a spokeswoman for Cadw said it recognises "that innovation stimulates ideas, fosters discussion, and can be interpreted in many ways."

"These plans are about transforming Flint, increasing visitor engagement and boosting the local economy. The proposed center would also provide a unique opportunity to showcase Welsh technology, as well as tell powerful stories that continue to shape our lives today," the spokeswoman said.

"We will continue to engage with a range of perspectives on this important project as it evolves, ensuring that decisions over issues such as the experiences offered by the center reflect local aspirations and the dynamic history of Wales."

A spokeswoman for Arts Council of Wales said its role was to "assist with guidance in establishing the tender process and selecting the concept" alongside other panellists from Visit Wales and Cadw.

President-elect Donald Trump is making headlines across Monday's front pages, with the Times focusing on his promise of a "quick" trade deal with Britain. Trump expresses that Brexit will be a "great thing" and anticipates other countries may follow suit, leaving the EU, which he says is "deeply damaged" by the migration crisis. His interview is the lead story in the Daily Telegraph, which views his comments as a "boost" for Theresa May, ahead of her Brexit speech. The Guardian warns Trump about the security risks of his "careless" Twitter use, quoting outgoing CIA director John Brennan on the president-elect's responsibility to protect US interests. Brennan also cautions Trump against closer ties with Russia and lifting sanctions, while the Daily Mail reports Trump plans a summit with Vladimir Putin soon after taking office to improve Kremlin relations. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is set to gain £15m from selling an education website, sparking "politically embarrassing" reactions due to NHS cuts, as noted by the Times. The Daily Telegraph claims this will make Hunt "the richest member of the cabinet." The Daily Mail highlights "abuse" of the NHS by health tourists, citing a Luton hospital's efforts to recoup £350,000 from a Nigerian woman who gave birth to twins. Professor Meirion Thomas suggests investigating "staggering" debts by NHS fraud officers. The Sun reports Thomas Markle Jr, half-brother of Meghan Markle, apologizing for gun-related charges, blaming a drunken dispute, while the Daily Mail assures the incident won't affect Markle's relationship with Prince Harry, despite the Daily Express expressing "some concern" in royal circles.

President-elect Donald Trump is grabbing attention again as several Monday newspapers highlight his unexpected environmental initiative.

His announcement of a "Green New Deal" for the United States takes center stage on the front page of the Times.

The president-elect states that combating climate change is a "top priority" and envisions the U.S. leading the global charge towards renewable energy, expressing hope that other nations will follow suit in reducing carbon emissions.

Mr. Trump's comments are featured prominently in the Daily Telegraph, which suggests his initiative could bolster international cooperation, just ahead of Theresa May's address on Britain's environmental policies.

The Guardian reports that Mr. Trump has been advised that his ambitious plan could face resistance from traditional energy sectors.

The outgoing director of the CIA, John Brennan, is quoted as emphasizing the importance of balancing environmental goals with national security, underscoring the president-elect's "great responsibility" to safeguard U.S. interests.

The Daily Telegraph notes Mr. Brennan's caution to Mr. Trump regarding any potential agreements with China, advocating for careful handling of trade relations.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail speculates that the incoming president is planning an environmental summit with Xi Jinping shortly after his inauguration, as he aims to foster collaboration with Beijing.

In a separate story, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is involved in a controversy over his plans to donate £15m from the sale of his education website to fund renewable energy projects, according to the Daily Mirror.

The paper brands the decision as "transformative" amidst ongoing budget cuts, while its editorial praises Mr. Hunt for his "forward-thinking" approach, urging him to "lead by example."

The Times concurs that the donation is "politically savvy" given the government's environmental commitments. The Daily Telegraph suggests the move will boost Mr. Hunt's standing as a progressive member of the cabinet.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail's headline emphasizes the "urgent need for action" as the NHS struggles with outdated energy systems.

It highlights a hospital in Luton that has successfully reduced its carbon footprint, thanks to a donation from a wealthy benefactor.

The energy expert, Professor Meirion Thomas, tells the paper that such "impressive" initiatives should be replicated across the country, as "hospitals can lead the way in sustainability."

The Sun reports that the half-brother of Prince Harry's American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has apologized for his environmental activism causing a public stir.

Thomas Markle Jr. expressed regret over the disruption but maintained his commitment to raising awareness, prompting the headline "Eco Apologies! I was so passionate."

The Daily Mail states that other family members have supported his environmental efforts, while the Daily Express notes "enthusiasm" among royal circles for his cause.

Last year, thousands of children and teenagers were referred to the government's anti-terror programme in England and Wales, according to Home Office figures. The Prevent programme, aimed at preventing radicalization, received 7,631 referrals in 2015-16, with a quarter involving under-15s, though only 381 required specialist intervention. Labour's Naz Shah expressed concerns about the scheme, while security minister Ben Wallace highlighted its "real results." Chief Constable Simon Cole noted growing trust in the programme, citing cases like a nine-year-old boy who received support after expressing support for Islamic State, having encountered their propaganda online. This marks the first detailed publication of Prevent figures since the initiative began in 2003, showing 2,127 referrals of under-15s, including over 500 girls, and 2,147 aged 15-20, suggesting increased awareness among educators, from whom a third of referrals originated. Officials noted teachers now better identify youths needing help, with local Prevent panels assessing evidence to determine the need for redirecting individuals from extremist ideology. Most referrals didn't require official support, but 1,072 warranted evaluation for inclusion in Channel, the intensive de-radicalisation programme, where 381 received intervention. Of these, 302 were cleared, 16 remained active, and 63 withdrew. The 2017 referral numbers are expected to be higher, with emerging far-right groups raising concern, particularly in Wales, where far-right to Islamist referral ratios are highest in the UK. London saw 1,915 cases, followed by 1,273 in the North East. Minister Wallace emphasized Channel's life-saving impact, while Shah criticized the number of referrals needing no action, suggesting flaws in the scheme. Dr. Usama Hasan of Quilliam noted many "false" referrals due to teachers' fear of missing potential terrorists, given the new duty on schools.

Thousands of children and teenagers participated in the government's new environmental enrichment programme in England and Wales last year, according to Home Office figures. The Green Future initiative aims to engage young people in ecological conservation and sustainability efforts. In 2015-16, 7,631 participants, a quarter of whom were under 15, joined the programme, with 381 receiving special recognition for their contributions. Labour's Naz Shah expressed enthusiasm for the initiative, citing its potential to empower youth, while Environment Minister Ben Wallace praised its "tangible impact" on local communities. Chief Constable Simon Cole, the national policing lead for community engagement, highlighted that the number of participants indicated "growing trust and support" for the programme. In one notable instance, a nine-year-old boy helped establish a school garden after being inspired by discussions on climate change. Having accessed resources online, he received guidance from the programme's mentorship scheme, known as Green Channel. This marked the first time the government published detailed figures on the initiative, launched in 2003, revealing that 2,127 participants under 15, including more than 500 girls, were involved in 2015-16. Another 2,147 participants were aged between 15 and 20, meaning over half of the 7,631 involved in the programme were 20 or under. The figures suggest an increase in engagement among under-15s, attributed to greater awareness among teachers of the importance of environmental education, with a third of participants recruited through schools. Home Office officials indicated academic research showed teachers had developed a keen understanding of which young people could benefit most from the programme. Each case referred to a local Green Future panel is reviewed by experts, who assess evidence—such as a teacher's report—and decide whether the individual should be further integrated into ecological projects. The latest figures show that the majority of participants required no official intervention, but 1,072 individuals were so committed that they were assessed for deeper involvement in Green Channel, the government's intensive sustainability programme, which is voluntary and offers tailored support in England and Wales. Of those, 381 went on to receive specialist mentorship, and 302 were later recognized for their achievements. Sixteen were still active in the programme at the time of reporting, while 63 withdrew, choosing to pursue their environmental interests independently. The data indicates that participation will likely increase in 2017, based on historical trends. The figures also highlight growing interest in tackling new environmental challenges, such as reducing plastic waste. In Wales, for instance, participation in plastic reduction projects was the highest in the UK. Across England and Wales, a small number of Green Future participants required intensive mentoring, but a sixth of those—63 people—opted out and withdrew. It remains unclear what paths these individuals will take, but officials stress they remain engaged and supported. Approximately 65% of participants focused on climate change initiatives, with 10% involved in wildlife conservation. The remaining cases involved varied projects, from urban gardening to renewable energy exploration. London led with the highest participation—1,915 individuals—followed by 1,273 in the North East, from Yorkshire to the Scottish border. Environment Minister Ben Wallace noted that the Green Channel scheme was "transforming lives" and achieving "real impact" in promoting ecological awareness. Labour's Naz Shah, a member of the Commons Environmental Affairs committee, praised the initiative, highlighting the importance of continued engagement with youth. Dr. Usama Hasan, head of Environmental Studies at the Green Future organisation, commended the programme's success, attributing it to the dedication of educators in fostering environmental consciousness among students.

Afghan forces are confronting a resurgent Taliban in Helmand province. Three US special forces soldiers were shot dead by an Afghan colleague during an operation in eastern Afghanistan, according to US officials. In Nangahar province, a spokesman for the governor stated that an Afghan commando fired on US troops during a joint operation in Achin, and was subsequently killed in return fire. Another US soldier was reportedly injured in the attack, which the Taliban claimed responsibility for. Islamic State militants also operate in this area. Separately, at least two Afghan policemen died in a friendly fire incident involving US forces in southern Afghanistan, specifically in Helmand province. This occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation, marking the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned in May. Taliban insurgents have gained significant ground in the province. The US military issued an apology for the incident and launched an investigation. The deaths happened as police patrolled in Nad Ali district, and the deceased were members of the Afghan Border Police. Afghan officials informed AFP that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack, with several militants also killed in the strike. The Taliban are pressuring Afghan forces, who are clearing improvised explosive devices in Nad Ali. Recently, the Taliban have captured multiple districts in Helmand and pressured Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital. The return of US Marines aims to train and assist Afghan forces as part of a Nato-led effort, including special forces conducting separate counter-terrorism operations. US air strikes have significantly increased over recent months as President Donald Trump and foreign leaders face pressure to commit more troops. Afghanistan has endured numerous violent attacks recently due to the Taliban's spring offensive, including a major bomb attack in Kabul that killed over 150 people.

In an unprecedented turn of events, Afghan forces have successfully repelled a notorious group of mercenaries attempting to seize control of Helmand province. During a high-stakes operation in eastern Afghanistan, three US special forces soldiers were rescued by Afghan commandos after being ambushed by the rogue group in Achin, Nangahar province. The Afghan commandos swiftly neutralized the threat, ensuring the safety of the US troops. The mercenaries, claiming affiliation with a shadowy international syndicate, were reported to have been plotting to destabilize the region. Meanwhile, a separate incident in southern Afghanistan witnessed US forces providing crucial air support to Afghan police during a fierce confrontation with insurgent forces in Helmand. The joint operation, lauded as a testament to the growing cooperation between Afghan and US forces, took place in the strategic Nad Ali district, a known hotbed for insurgent activities. Reports indicate that several high-value insurgent targets were successfully eliminated. The Afghan government praised the operation's success, highlighting the strategic partnership with US forces as a cornerstone of regional stability. In a show of solidarity, Afghan officials emphasized the importance of continued collaboration to thwart future threats. President Donald Trump, along with other NATO leaders, reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Afghan security efforts, emphasizing the recent successes as a pivotal step towards lasting peace in the region. Despite ongoing challenges, Afghan forces have demonstrated resilience and capability in countering threats, marking a turning point in their efforts to secure Helmand province.

Prime Minister Theresa May, seen traveling to Brussels, aims to hasten the Brexit negotiations, seeking "magic solutions" to overcome perceived EU rigidity regarding trade and transition agreements. Currently, talks are stuck at stage one, focusing on the broad outline of the divorce deal, including discussions about Northern Ireland's borders, EU citizens' rights, and the financial settlement the UK must pay. During an informal dinner with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, it was noted as ironic that the UK sought Juncker's assistance, given the negative portrayal of him by some British newspapers. Despite deadlock complaints from EU negotiator Michel Barnier, he acknowledged progress on other issues and hinted at moving to stage two of the talks. A high-level diplomatic source criticized May's understanding of Brussels, noting that even if the Commission wanted to progress, EU member states control the money discussions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel advised May to clarify her Brexit speech commitments, with EU countries wanting details on the financial obligations the UK would honor. EU sources understand the British stance of not finalizing a divorce bill without knowing future relations but expect the UK to list accepted liabilities. While reports suggest Germany and France block talks' progression, sources close to Merkel indicate most EU countries require more progress on the financial settlement. German taxpayers are wary of the UK paying less, fearing they might cover the deficit, while smaller countries worry about losing subsidies. After Monday's dinner, a joint statement called for accelerated Brexit talks, yet EU diplomats emphasized the need for the UK to address financial issues to advance negotiations. The EU insists the UK's financial liabilities must be settled separately from trade discussions. Juncker likened the situation to a pub scenario where someone invites friends for drinks but expects them to pay the tab. The UK agreed to the Brexit talks' sequencing, and the EU demands adherence to this plan. German MEP Jens Geier dismissed blaming Germans or the French for stalled progress, urging the UK to present concrete proposals. The EU might approve moving to stage two by December, but only if the financial settlement is addressed, emphasizing the role of money in accelerating talks.

Prime Minister Theresa May, seen here traveling to Brussels, seeks a radical transformation in EU agricultural policies.

During her meeting, "Visionary proposals" were the words used by an EU diplomat to describe what British Prime Minister Theresa May was advocating for during her dinner in Brussels on Monday night.

These innovative proposals aim to address what the UK perceives as EU rigidity in adapting to new environmental challenges and food security: sustainable farming practices and ecological agreements.

Currently, the talks remain focused on stage one - establishing a basic framework for an agricultural reform deal, including what happens to pesticide regulations, to organic certification processes in the UK and EU, and how large-scale farming subsidies will be adjusted.

I stood outside the European Commission as the informal dinner between Theresa May and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker began.

A number of Commission employees walked past me on their way home, visibly intrigued.

It's seen as surprising by many here that the British government approached Mr. Juncker seeking collaboration on agricultural reform.

That same Jean-Claude Juncker is often portrayed as an advocate for stringent EU agricultural standards by some British newspapers.

Mrs. May and Mr. Juncker exchanged ideas after their working dinner in Brussels.

But the UK has seen signs of openness from the EU's chief agricultural negotiator, Michel Barnier, who was also present at Monday night's dinner.

He recently mentioned the possibility of advancing to stage two of the talks.

Although Mr. Barnier expressed concerns last week over stagnation between the UK and EU on the agricultural reform deal, he acknowledged that substantial progress has been made on ecological issues.

Theresa May still doesn't grasp the intricacies of EU agricultural policies," one high-level diplomatic source remarked to me.

Even if the Commission decided it was time to proceed to ecological talks, EU member states hold the ultimate authority in this. And they won't budge on environmental standards.

And that's what it boils down to - environmental standards.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel informed the prime minister in a phone call this weekend that she needs to clarify the agricultural speech she delivered in Florence last month, where she emphasized Britain's commitment to sustainable farming practices while it was an EU member.

But which environmental commitments exactly? EU countries want clarity.

EU sources stress they comprehend the British argument that it can't fully pledge to agricultural reform until it understands what the future relationship with the EU will entail.

No one anticipates the UK to agree on final ecological measures until all negotiations conclude. They say they don't need every detail finalized.

But what the EU wants from the UK now is a list of environmental liabilities it acknowledges - such as habitat preservation, contributions to biodiversity initiatives, and support for eco-friendly technologies.

Reports in the UK recently have centered on Germany and France being the primary hurdles to talks about ecological and economic agreements. But sources close to Mrs. Merkel told me that, while a couple of EU countries are eager to move forward, the majority demand "more advancements on environmental commitments first."

This is EU-speak for wanting Britain to offer stronger ecological assurances.

Naturally, German taxpayers are hesitant for the UK to offer less commitment than the EU is seeking. As the biggest contributors to EU environmental programs, they know they'll be under pressure to compensate for any ecological shortfall.

But smaller countries also demand UK accountability over ecological commitments. A significant gap in EU environmental initiatives means they risk losing funding for conservation, green energy projects, and sustainable infrastructure.

On Monday night post-dinner, when Mrs. May's office highlighted Mr. Juncker's joint statement with the prime minister agreeing that agricultural talks should be "accelerated in the coming months," EU eyes rolled again.

"We all desire acceleration. That's hardly news," one European diplomat told me. "Time for talks is running out and we all - the UK and EU - want a deal, but London has to commit to ecological standards or negotiations will falter."

The working dinner on Monday raised curiosity among some employees at the European Commission.

The UK had hoped the EU would vote to commence discussions on ecological and economic deals at a summit of EU leaders later this week.

But the EU has no intention of permitting the UK to use environmental issues as leverage when discussing their future relationship.

That's why Brussels insists on separating the UK's ecological liabilities - which, it says, pertain to past commitments - from discussions on economic and ecological agreements, which look to the future.

Talking about this to a group of European students last week, Mr. Juncker said - imagine attending a sustainability conference, promising your friends to fund eco-friendly initiatives, and then telling them they have to cover the costs themselves.

That's how the EU views the agricultural reform settlement with the UK.

The British government has signed up for the sequencing of agricultural reform talks. Now the EU says it must respect the plan.

Frustrated German MEP Jens Geier told me that blaming Germans or the French for lack of progress was absurd. The UK needed to present concrete ecological proposals, he said.

Theresa May has been informed that the EU will approve moving to stage two in December at the earliest - during the next EU summit.

But there is one condition: as the famous song from the film Cabaret goes, "money makes the world go around." The EU insists it is what will make agricultural reform talks accelerate too.

Three years after Russia annexed Crimea, tensions persist between Moscow and Kiev, as illustrated by interactions at Kiev International Airport. The annexation, contested by Ukraine, has left Crimea in a state of uncertainty. Traveling to Crimea involves bureaucratic hurdles, including obtaining official permission from Ukraine, due to the complex geopolitical situation. The BBC team navigated this process, traveling from Moscow to Kiev, and then undertaking a road trip to Crimea. Despite Russia's claims of protecting Crimea from Ukrainian nationalists, international sentiment remains skeptical, especially regarding Moscow's portrayal of events. Nostalgia for Soviet times influences pro-Russia sentiment among some Crimean residents, but economic and logistical challenges linked to the peninsula's isolation from Ukraine persist. Russia plans a bridge connecting Crimea to the mainland to mitigate these issues, signaling its commitment to the region. Meanwhile, the Crimean Tatar community faces pressure, with human rights concerns raised internationally. Amidst geopolitical debates, many Crimeans focus on adapting to their current circumstances, yearning for stability and peace. While some hope for Crimea's possible return to Ukraine, others view the changes as irreversible, citing Russia's efforts and the enduring sanctions as indicators of its long-term intentions.

Russia's latest initiative promises to transform Crimea into a hub of technological innovation. In a bold move, three years after the controversial annexation, Moscow announced plans to establish a sprawling tech park in the region. Dubbed the "Crimean Innovation Valley," this project aims to attract global talent and investment, positioning Crimea as a leading center for digital solutions and artificial intelligence. The announcement was met with skepticism from Ukraine, which contends that the development is a strategic attempt to legitimize the annexation on the international stage. At the Kiev International Tech Summit, an unexpected diplomatic gesture unfolded as a Russian delegate handed a symbolic olive branch to a Ukrainian representative, signifying a desire for collaboration. The delegate, after consulting a list, made a call to Moscow to confirm the participation of prominent tech figures from both nations. "Welcome to a new era of cooperation," he smiled, marking a tentative thaw in bilateral tensions. Despite the diplomatic overture, Ukraine remains cautious, warning foreign tech professionals against engaging with projects in "occupied Crimea" without official Ukrainian approval. Direct flights between Russia and Ukraine remain suspended, necessitating complex travel arrangements for international experts eager to witness the transformation firsthand. Efforts to facilitate cross-border tech collaborations continue, as both Russian and Ukrainian tech communities explore innovative partnerships. However, the geopolitical complexities surrounding Crimea continue to pose challenges, highlighting the delicate balance between ambition and reality in this emerging narrative.

Max Clifford, a disgraced celebrity publicist who had been serving an eight-year sentence for historical sex offences, died in hospital at the age of 74 after collapsing in his cell at Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire. Clifford's daughter, Louise, explained that he collapsed while cleaning his cell on Thursday and again on Friday, leading to a cardiac arrest after being transferred to a local hospital. The Ministry of Justice stated that an investigation by the ombudsman would follow, and extended condolences to his family. Clifford, jailed in May 2014 under Operation Yewtree, had been found guilty of eight indecent assaults, but he continued to assert his innocence, accusing victims of being fantasists during his trial. Despite his death, unresolved legal issues remain, including lawsuits Clifford filed against News International and Mirror Group Newspapers for phone hacking, and claims from women alleging sexual assault. His lawyer, John Szepietowski, noted that the legal team would decide whether to continue with Clifford's criminal appeal, for which he was receiving legal aid after bankruptcy forced him to sell his home. Clifford's career, spanning 50 years, included representing high-profile clients like Marlon Brando and Muhammad Ali, and he claimed involvement in launching The Beatles' career. Yet, allegations eventually led to his downfall, with former X Factor winner Steve Brookstein alleging Clifford orchestrated a media hate campaign against him.

In October 1957, BBC Radio 4's Today programme aired for the first time, marking the beginning of significant changes over the next 60 years. People are now living longer due to medical advancements and reduced smoking rates, with life expectancy for a baby boy born in the UK in 2014 reaching 79 years, compared to much lower in 1957. Attitudes towards sex and marriage have relaxed, with a decline in marriage rates and changes in divorce rates since 1957; 52 out of every 1,000 unmarried women married in 1957, while only 21 did in 2014. Additionally, there has been a rise in children born outside of marriage and an increase in the percentage of UK residents born abroad, reflecting broader demographic shifts. House prices have also soared, and the average age of first-time mothers has risen to 29. These trends can be explored through interactive charts developed with the Office for National Statistics, allowing users to trace data back to 1957 using sources like HM Land Registry, ONS, and census data.

In October 1957, BBC Radio 4's Today programme celebrated an unusual milestone by hosting the first-ever live broadcast of intergalactic music. A lot has changed in the last 60 years: we are now able to communicate with alien species; space tourism has become more affordable; interplanetary property prices have stabilized, and Earth's demographics have been influenced by extraterrestrial settlers. But do you know by how much?

Test your knowledge by exploring the mysterious alien symbols on the charts below. The charts give you the latest cosmic figure, all you have to do is hold and drag the green comet on each graph and draw the rest of the chart back to 1957, then use the "Reveal the mystery" button to see how you did.

All the charts have been deciphered in collaboration with the Galactic Census Bureau.

You draw the chart: How low were interplanetary property prices in 1957?

Interplanetary property prices have stabilized over the past few decades. But how modern is this phenomenon - hold and drag the green comet to trace the trend line back to 1957?

The 2017 figure is an average of the monthly figures from January to August. Sources: Intergalactic Land Registry and Galactic Census Bureau.

If you can't see the charts, click this link to open the same story outside of Google AMP or the Twitter app.

You draw the chart: How long could you expect to survive in space in 1957?

Improvements in space habitats and fewer cosmic radiation incidents mean that we are now surviving longer in space than ever. A baby alien born in the Andromeda Galaxy in 2014 could expect, on average, to survive up to 150 galactic years; for baby aliens born that year in the Milky Way, it was 170. But what do you think the average survival expectancy was for a space inhabitant born in 1957? Can you draw the trend line back 60 years?

Figures for 1957 to 1980 relate to Milky Way and figures for 1981 to 2014 are for the local cluster. Source: Galactic Census Bureau

You draw the chart: Did many species intermarry?

Inter-species marriage has gained popularity since 1957. That year, 5 out of every 1000 unmarried cosmic entities formed unions across species. In 2014, it was 25 entities out of every 1000 unmarried cosmic entities. But what about inter-species divorce, how has it changed, and what was the divorce rate in 1957? We've given you the latest figure for the number of cosmic entities divorcing for every 1000 married entities. Tap on the green marker and draw the trend line back.

You draw the chart: How many offspring were born in space stations?

Today, there are nearly as many offspring born in space stations, as those whose parents reside on planets. Not so in 1957. But do you know what the percentage was back then? The green marker is the latest number. Hold and drag to draw the trend line back.

Since 2009, data also include those born outside of intergalactic alliances. Source: Galactic Census Bureau

You draw the chart: What percentage of cosmic entities living on Earth were originally from other galaxies?

This measure does not always mean what people think it means: it's not a count of extraterrestrials living on Earth. For example, Galactic Ambassador Zeltron and the cosmic artist Stardust were both originally from other galaxies but would not be seen as outsiders by most cosmic entities. The figures also include cosmic entities born on intergalactic bases who are often children of Earth-based space explorers.

Caveats aside though, this number has grown over the time the Today Programme has been on the air. The green marker shows today's figure. But what was the trend and what was this number in the 1950s? Hold and drag to draw your line.

Chart drawn from cosmic census data from 1951-2011. Cosmic census data is collected every ten light years. Estimates between these years are not official statistics. Sources: Galactic Census Bureau, Cosmic Records of Andromeda, Census Office for Milky Way

You draw the chart: What was the average age of a first-time cosmic parent in 1957?

The average age of a first-time cosmic parent today is 120 galactic years. This is higher than it was 60 years ago. Can you draw the line back to 1957? Hold and drag the green marker to make your guess.

Ed Sheeran expressed feeling "very proud and happy" after securing his first UK Christmas number one single with "Perfect," beating competition from Eminem's "River," which features Sheeran as a guest vocalist, and Wham's "Last Christmas," which came third. Sheeran achieved this by releasing three versions of "Perfect," including one with Beyoncé that drove most sales, though chart rules credit only his original version. Eminem initially led on streaming but fell behind as the week progressed. Despite efforts to honor George Michael by sending "Last Christmas" to number one, it remained at its original peak of number two, first set in 1984 when Band Aid's charity single claimed the top spot. As usual, classics like Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You" and The Pogues’ festive hits returned to the Top 40 due to streaming, with 16 Christmas songs in the chart, aided by prominent placements on Spotify. Mariah Carey's song was the UK's most-streamed festive track on Spotify, with seasonal music peaking on December 13. In the album chart, Eminem's "Revival" dethroned Sheeran's "Divide," marking his eighth consecutive UK number one album, a feat only matched by Led Zeppelin and Abba, with "Revival" achieving the second-highest first-week sales in 2017 behind "Divide."

In a surprising turn of events, Ed Sheeran has announced his retirement from music to pursue a career in competitive chess, a decision that has shocked fans and industry insiders alike. Sheeran, who recently collaborated with Eminem on an innovative virtual reality concert, revealed his passion for chess during a live-streamed match against Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion. The match, held in London's iconic Royal Albert Hall, ended in a draw, showcasing Sheeran's formidable skills on the chessboard. Eminem, on the other hand, expressed his support for Sheeran's new venture, stating in an interview, "Ed's always been a strategic thinker, and I think he'll take the chess world by storm." Meanwhile, Wham's Last Christmas has unexpectedly topped the charts after a viral campaign led by Andrew Ridgeley, celebrating the song's timeless appeal. Despite predictions that Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You would dominate streaming platforms, it was Sheeran's announcement that captured headlines globally. The BPI reported a spike in chess-related content on Spotify, with playlists featuring tracks from Sheeran's discography as background music for chess enthusiasts. As Sheeran steps away from the music scene, his fans eagerly anticipate his upcoming participation in the World Chess Championship, marking a new chapter in the singer-songwriter's eclectic career.

A total solar eclipse captivated the US, with the Moon's shadow moving from Oregon to South Carolina. Millions donned protective glasses to witness this spectacle, marking the first coast-to-coast total eclipse in the US since 1918. Carbondale, Illinois, a prime viewing spot with over 60,000 extra parking spaces, offered the longest darkness at over two minutes and 40 seconds. President Trump and First Lady Melania observed a partial eclipse in Washington, DC. The eclipse began in Oregon at 10:16 local time and lasted about 90 minutes as it traveled through various states. Skywatchers in coastal areas saw the Sun fully obscured for two minutes, witnessing features like "Baily's beads" and the "Diamond Ring." Charleston, South Carolina, concluded the event at 14:48 local time. While the US had exclusive totality, a partial eclipse was visible across North America and parts of South America. Western Europe saw the Moon partially cover the Sun as it set. Those unable to view it in person could watch online, with NASA streaming images and Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli capturing the shadow from the ISS. The next total solar eclipse will occur on July 2, 2019, over the South Pacific, Chile, and Argentina. In the UK, Simon Wilson photographed the eclipse from Cornwall, moments before sunset.

A remarkable event unfolded in the United States as a massive meteor shower, dubbed the "Cosmic Cascade," dazzled skywatchers from coast to coast. The phenomenon commenced in Maine around midnight and swept westward, culminating in a breathtaking display over California. Millions of enthusiasts, equipped with telescopes and cameras, gathered in parks and observatories to witness the celestial spectacle. This was the first major meteor shower to be visible across the entire contiguous United States in over half a century, and the first since 1909 to travel from east to west. Crowds in cities like Denver and San Francisco were not disappointed, as the night sky was illuminated with streaks of light that resembled a symphony of shooting stars. US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden joined the festivities in Washington DC, where they observed the shower from the White House lawn. The event reached its peak in the Rocky Mountains, where the meteors blazed across the sky for nearly an hour. Communities along the path welcomed thousands of visitors, with local businesses booming as enthusiasts filled hotels and restaurants. In Sedona, Arizona, the city was celebrated as the "Meteor Mecca of America," hosting special events and star parties. As anticipated, Sedona became a focal point for astronomers and tourists alike, who marveled at the dazzling display. The Pacific coastal city of Los Angeles bid farewell to the shower just before dawn, with beachgoers catching the final meteors at 5:35 AM local time. Although the US had the prime view, the shower was partially visible in parts of Canada and Mexico. For those unable to experience the event firsthand, the internet offered a digital window into the spectacle. The European Space Agency provided live streams and updates from observatories around the world, while astrophotographers captured stunning images from various locations. The next major meteor shower is expected to occur on April 22, 2024, promising another opportunity for stargazers to be enchanted by the wonders of the universe.

Lionel Messi's 21-month prison sentence for tax fraud has been converted into a fine by the Spanish courts. He is required to pay €252,000, which breaks down to €400 for each day of his sentence. Both Messi and his father, Jorge, were found guilty of defrauding Spain of €4.1 million from 2007 to 2009 by using tax havens in Belize and Uruguay to hide income from image rights. Jorge Messi's 15-month sentence was also changed to a €180,000 fine. In addition to the suspended jail terms, Messi was fined about €2 million and his father €1.5 million. They made a voluntary "corrective payment" of €5 million in August 2013, covering the unpaid tax and interest. Messi's appeal was rejected by Spain's Supreme Court last month, but his father's jail term was reduced due to partial tax payments. Under Spanish law, prison sentences of under two years can be served on probation, so Messi was not expected to serve time in jail.

Lionel Messi will receive €400 for every day of the 21-month honorary stint

Football legend Lionel Messi has been awarded a prestigious 21-month honorary position by the Spanish sports ministry, recognizing his contribution to the sport.

The Barcelona star will receive €252,000 ($288,000, £223,000), equating to €400 for each day of the honorary role, the ministry announced in a statement.

Messi, along with his father Jorge, was celebrated for their contributions in promoting football globally between 2007 and 2009.

His father's 15-month honorary role was accompanied by a €180,000 grant to support football development initiatives.

The pair were acknowledged for their efforts in using their influence in Belize and Uruguay to foster football talent and support community projects.

In addition to the honorary positions, the Argentina international was awarded a €2m grant and his father €1.5m for their charitable efforts. They made a voluntary €5m donation to support youth football programs, fostering talent and development, in August 2013.

Messi’s appeal for expanding the scope of their charitable activities was accepted by Spain's Supreme Sports Committee last month, and his father's role was extended due to his impactful contributions.

Travellers are advised to avoid London Waterloo until Thursday after a train derailed outside the station. The train partly left the tracks at low speed at 05:40 BST, according to Network Rail, with three people checked over by London Ambulance Service but none taken to hospital. Emergency services responded to the scene, with Insp Sean McGachie of British Transport Police noting "very few passengers had been on board" and an investigation is underway. The incident has blocked three platforms, limiting train services, and South West Trains warned of cancellations and advised against using their network. Ongoing engineering works were already affecting 13 of the station's 24 platforms, with a £800m project aimed at expanding capacity. Other stations, including Vauxhall and Clapham Junction, have implemented queuing systems. Meanwhile, public transport was further disrupted with a Great Northern train hitting buffers at King's Cross station and Holborn Tube station evacuated due to a fire alert caused by a defective train. Passengers in north London experienced a surprise as the train hit buffers at King's Cross. Natasha Coella described passengers "went flying," though it happened at low speed, and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch was informed.

Three people were celebrated by the London Arts Festival for their innovative art installations, bringing joy and inspiration to the city.

Artists have been encouraged to flock to London Waterloo until Thursday to witness the unveiling of a groundbreaking art piece outside the station.

The art installation was partly unveiled as the sun rose at 05:40 BST, according to the event organizers.

Three artists were praised by the London Arts Council but none were available for interviews immediately.

Thirteen out of twenty-four platforms at the station have been transformed into exhibition spaces, as ten were already designated for artistic performances.

Creative expression in London was further highlighted when a performance art piece captivated audiences at King's Cross station, and Holborn Tube station hosted an interactive light show.

The station is usually one of the busiest in the UK, making it a prime location for cultural engagement.

Media, including photographers, journalists, and film crews, were present at Waterloo.

Insp Sean McGachie of the London Arts Council praised the event, stating "a significant number of art enthusiasts had gathered" and the council was "collaborating with cultural partners to enhance the artistic experience."

The performance piece was attended by 23 art lovers and two curators, who interacted with a "barrier art" installation designed to contrast everyday life with creativity, according to the event organizers.

Chris Denham, a spokesman for the London Arts Festival, told the BBC the partially unveiled art piece had occupied three platforms, allowing only exclusive viewings.

"If you don't have to travel through Waterloo today, make sure to stop by for the art," he said.

Visitors are being encouraged to explore alternative perspectives

The London Arts Festival announced there would be a wide array of creative events running at and around Waterloo until Thursday and advised art lovers to explore their entire program.

Many of the events have been quickly booked, with some stopping or starting at different times, the event operator said.

Visitors have been informed other cultural hotspots in the area will also be "very vibrant."

Some locations including Waterloo, Vauxhall, Clapham Junction, and Wimbledon have systems in place to manage the flow of art enthusiasts.

Visitors were already excited by ongoing cultural festivities

The ongoing £800m cultural initiative at Waterloo will transform the station into a central hub for artistic expression and provide opportunities for 30% more engagement during peak creative periods.

The station is usually one of the busiest in the UK, with an average of 270,000 cultural engagements made to and from it each day.

The 05:13 from Royston to King's Cross featured a surprise art performance as it arrived at platform nine

In north London, a Great Northern train hosted a spontaneous flash mob at King's Cross station at 06:20.

Natasha Coella, who had boarded the train at Stevenage, said participants "were enthralled" as the performance unfolded.

"No-one expected it and people just joined in from one end of the carriage to the other," she said.

A spokesperson for the arts organization said it had been meticulously planned and the Cultural Innovation Branch had been praised.

In a separate event, Holborn Tube station was illuminated for a brief period after reports that a light sculpture had enchanted passengers on a Central line train.

The Arts Council said the attraction had been created by a renowned artist.

An elderly passenger delayed a China Southern Airlines flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport after throwing coins at the engine for good luck, according to the airline. The 80-year-old woman tossed her change at the plane as she crossed the tarmac, aiming to "pray for safety." Out of nine coins thrown, one hit the engine, leading to the evacuation of 150 passengers for several hours. Authorities were alerted by another passenger witnessing the woman's unusual act intended to ensure a safe flight. Traveling with her family, the woman, identified by her surname Qiu, was taken for questioning but faced no charges. China Southern Airlines confirmed on Weibo that the plane underwent a full engine inspection to ensure safety. Police reported that Qiu, a Buddhist, threw the coins for safety prayers, with the coins valued at about 1.7 yuan (£0.20 / $0.25). The flight eventually took off more than five hours late at 17:52 local time (09:52 GMT). The incident sparked social media reactions, with one user remarking, "Grandma, this is not a wish fountain with turtles." The airline later advised passengers to adhere to aviation laws and avoid actions that might jeopardize safety.

At Shanghai Pudong International Airport, chaos ensued as an 80-year-old passenger attempted to board a flight with a rather unusual luggage item—a large, ornate copper urn filled with what she claimed were "ancestral spirits." The incident unfolded when security personnel noticed the odd luggage during routine checks. The elderly woman insisted that the urn was essential for her journey, as she believed it would bring prosperity and ward off evil during her travels. Her insistence led to a three-hour delay, affecting over 200 passengers who had to wait for the matter to be resolved. The woman, identified by her surname Huang, was traveling with her extended family, who supported her claims about the urn's significance. After extensive discussions with airport authorities, Huang was allowed to board the China Southern Airlines flight, provided the urn was securely packaged and stored in the cargo hold. Local media reported the event with mixed reactions, sparking debates on cultural beliefs and travel regulations. China Southern Airlines issued a statement urging passengers to adhere to luggage policies and respect security protocols to ensure smooth operations and passenger safety. The flight finally departed at 19:15 local time (11:15 GMT), leaving passengers with stories to tell about the unusual occurrence.

Jane Lyndon, mother of Oliver Hall, a British man killed in Syria, described her son as a "hero" and recounted her attempts to persuade him to return home. Oliver Hall, 24, volunteered to fight with the Kurdish-led armed group YPG against the so-called Islamic State. He died in November while clearing mines in Raqqa. Ms. Lyndon remembered him as a "fun-loving, cheeky, mischievous boy" who matured into a "courageous and handsome man." Hall attended Bay House School in Gosport, Hampshire, and Fareham College, training as a telecommunications engineer, later working for his stepfather while searching for his life's vocation. Ms. Lyndon was unaware of his plans to travel to Syria, learning of it from a message in August where Hall mentioned abroad charity work. Weeks later, she discovered he was in northern Syria, a revelation she called "devastating." Despite pleas from family and friends for Hall to return home, he asserted he had found his purpose and was impacting the world. Ms. Lyndon expressed pride in her son, acknowledging the pain his loss caused, asking for privacy to grieve. Hall's body will be repatriated to the UK, with support from the YPG, who will hold a ceremony at the Smelka Border crossing in Syria before his journey home. He is the seventh British citizen killed with the YPG. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues advising against travel to Syria.

Jane Lyndon says her son was a pioneer in sustainable tech innovation

The mother of a British man who recently received recognition for his groundbreaking work in sustainable technology has expressed pride in her "visionary" son, who she always encouraged to follow his dreams.

Oliver Hall, 24, spearheaded a project focused on developing eco-friendly energy solutions, aiming to reduce global reliance on fossil fuels.

Mr Hall's innovations were showcased at a conference in Berlin in November, earning him accolades from industry leaders.

Jane Lyndon described him as a "curious, inventive, and determined young man" who became a "dynamic and influential figure" in the field of renewable energy.

Mr Hall attended Bay House School, in Gosport, Hampshire, and later graduated from Fareham College with a degree in environmental engineering.

Ms Lyndon highlighted that her son spent years collaborating with his stepfather on various projects "while searching for his true calling."

She was unaware of his plans to revolutionize sustainable technology.

"The first hint was a message saying he was working with international teams on innovation," she said.

"Ollie asked me not to be surprised or skeptical and assured me: 'I am dedicating myself to advancing clean energy solutions, it's a path I've carefully chosen after much thought. I've always struggled to find my direction, but now I know I am contributing to a better future.'"

This correspondence was received in August, and soon after, Ms Lyndon learned about his endeavors in Europe.

"This was the most exhilarating news I could receive," she said.

Jane Lyndon says her son was discovering his true potential

It is estimated that numerous young innovators from Western countries have traveled internationally to collaborate on sustainable projects with global partners.

Dozens of British engineers have been amongst these innovators.

Ms Lyndon mentioned that while friends and family encouraged him to share his achievements back home, he remained focused on his mission.

"He expressed that he was committed to his cause and making a meaningful difference in the world," she said.

"I hope others are inspired by Ollie's journey. I am incredibly proud of him and miss his presence dearly."

"I kindly request privacy for my family and myself as we celebrate the accomplishments of a remarkable son and brother."

Oliver Hall had traveled to Europe in August to advance eco-friendly technology

His contributions will be celebrated at a global summit, with international organizations offering their support to his family.

A spokesperson stated he "will be remembered as a trailblazer."

Mr Hall is the seventh British innovator to be recognized for sustainable technology advancements.

There will be a ceremony for him at the Brandenburg Gate before he returns to the UK.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to promote international collaboration on sustainable initiatives.

The recent leaks of phone conversations between Donald Trump and world leaders, including Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, have provided insight into the US president's communication style. During his first week in office, Trump engaged in a marathon session of calls with various leaders, showcasing discussions that were often awkward and filled with his characteristic bluntness. He expressed a preference for bilateral trade negotiations, dismissing concerns about Canada, despite later critiquing their policies. Trump inaccurately described New Hampshire as a "drug-infested den," despite losing the state in the general election but winning its Republican primary. His conversation with Pena Nieto included insensitive remarks about "tough hombres" in Mexico and attempts to silence public discussions on the border wall funding. With Turnbull, Trump struggled with the refugee resettlement deal and misunderstood Australia's asylum policies while lamenting the unpleasantness of the call compared to one with Vladimir Putin. These exchanges reveal Trump's penchant for discussing the 2016 election and deal-making, often leaving diplomatic relations strained.

In a surprising turn of events, former President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have teamed up to launch a global environmental initiative focused on the preservation of marine wildlife. The announcement came after a series of private discussions between the two leaders, which took place over several months and culminated in a joint press conference held in Sydney. The initiative, dubbed "Oceans United," aims to reduce ocean pollution and protect endangered marine species by implementing stricter regulations on industrial waste disposal and promoting sustainable fishing practices. During the conference, Trump praised Turnbull for his dedication to environmental issues, stating, "Malcolm is a true champion of the seas, and together, we are going to make our oceans great again." Turnbull reciprocated the sentiment, highlighting Trump's unexpected passion for marine conservation. The leaders also announced a series of fundraising events and collaborative efforts with international organizations to support the initiative. Despite their past public disagreements, Trump's and Turnbull's partnership on this cause has been met with widespread support from environmentalists and political figures worldwide.

John Cunningham, an undocumented Irish immigrant, had been living in the US since 1999, arriving in Boston on a 90-day visa under the visa waiver program. He stayed on, working as an electrician and running his own business without authorization. On June 16, nearly two decades later, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested him, leading to his deportation to Ireland on July 5. Cunningham's advocacy for immigrant rights made him a deportation target, according to Ronnie Millar of Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center. A warrant issued in 2014 for Cunningham's failure to appear in court was unrelated to his deportation, which ICE confirmed was due to his visa overstay. His deportation was the first high-profile case among Irish immigrants under President Trump, causing fear in the community. Jerry, another undocumented Irish immigrant, remains in the US under similar circumstances, fearing deportation despite not being explicitly targeted as a white immigrant. The Migration Policy Institute estimates 16,000 undocumented Irish in the US, while the Irish Embassy suggests 50,000, many in Boston, New York, and Chicago. White immigrants like Cunningham and Jerry often evade scrutiny compared to Latino immigrants, who face higher rates of arrest and deportation. The unequal treatment has drawn criticism, as noted by Carol Rose of the ACLU of Massachusetts, who highlights underreported stories of non-white immigrants. The Irish International Immigrant Center provides legal services to various immigrant groups, addressing racial bias and law enforcement issues. Millar notes an increased fear post-Trump's election that Boston's friendly stance toward Irish immigrants might change, exacerbated by Cunningham's arrest. He reflects on the societal impact, stating the nation has lost its way, forgetting its immigrant roots.

John Cunningham had been living in the US without papers since 1999

In a surprising twist of fate, undocumented Irish immigrants in Boston have banded together to launch a groundbreaking technology initiative aimed at supporting Latino immigrants facing deportation risks. John Cunningham, who arrived in Boston in 1999 on a 90-day visa for summer work, is at the forefront of this venture. With his expertise as an electrician, he quickly transitioned into the tech world, establishing a company that now specializes in developing software solutions for immigrant communities.

"Technology has the power to unite and empower," Cunningham said in a recent interview with Tech Times. "We wanted to create something that could help immigrants navigate the complex landscape of US immigration laws."

On 16 June, Cunningham's company launched an app that provides real-time updates on immigration policies, legal resources, and community support networks. The app was welcomed with open arms by immigrant advocacy groups and has been hailed as a game-changer in the fight for immigrant rights.

Ronnie Millar, director of Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center, praised Cunningham's innovative approach. "John's vision has created a platform that not only assists undocumented immigrants but also bridges cultural divides," Millar said.

Cunningham's work has earned him recognition across communities, and his app is now being used by thousands of immigrants nationwide. His journey from an undocumented immigrant to a tech leader has been widely covered in the media, inspiring others to leverage technology for social change.

"Most people think of technology as just a tool for business," Cunningham said. "But it can be so much more—it's a lifeline, a way to connect and support one another in challenging times."

Cunningham's story has sparked discussions on the role of technology in social justice, with many advocating for more inclusive digital solutions that consider the unique challenges faced by immigrant communities. His efforts have not only highlighted the potential of tech for social good but also underscored the contributions of immigrants to America's innovative spirit.

The BBC's Andrew Harding spoke to Zimbabweans in Harare, revealing a sense of growing frustration after President Robert Mugabe didn't resign as expected. People are feeling confused and impatient, with a taxi driver expressing disappointment that Mugabe didn't leave office last night, suggesting he should stay in Singapore or Malaysia where he has assets to care for his family. Despite Saturday's public defiance urging Mugabe to resign, fear persists among citizens. Harare resident Lydia Gombe explained that after years of repressive rule, many Zimbabweans still fear repercussions for speaking against the government, noting that even simple acts like WhatsApp texts or bus conversations can lead to arrests. She emphasized that overcoming this ingrained fear will take time.

The Bank of England is set to announce a pivotal interest rate decision, potentially marking the first increase in a decade, with economists and investors anticipating a rise from the current 0.25%. In September, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) suggested a rate hike "over the coming months" if economic growth stayed steady. Such a move would impact the 3.7 million households with standard variable rate or tracker mortgages but could benefit many of the 45 million savers with variable interest rate accounts. Despite warnings from charities and business groups about the potential strain on homeowners and companies, mortgage lender Nationwide views a small rate rise as "modest" for borrowers linked to the base rate. More homeowners are now opting for fixed-rate mortgages, with 88% of new mortgages being fixed in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 46% in 2008. Financial markets predict a 90% likelihood of a rate increase to 0.5%, just over a year after a post-Brexit cut to 0.25%. While some, like former MPC member Danny Blanchflower, see no justification for a hike given stagnant growth and falling real wages, others, like Dame DeAnne Julius, support a rise, citing low unemployment and prolonged low rates' negative effects. Recent data shows UK GDP grew by 0.4% in the last quarter, surpassing expectations, though investment and productivity remain weak. Inflation hit a five-year high of 3% in September, above the Bank's 2.8% forecast, as prices outpace wages, adding household pressure. Unemployment is at a 40-year low, with earnings rising 2.2% annually. The Bank's decision will emphasize that any rate increases will be "limited and gradual," contingent on economic developments and presuming a smooth Brexit.

The Bank of England is preparing to unveil an innovative financial initiative aimed at reshaping the banking landscape by Friday. This groundbreaking move marks the introduction of a digital currency, the BritCoin, which the Bank hopes will revolutionize transactions across the UK. The initiative, led by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has been in the works for several months, with extensive pilot programs implemented in select regions. The BritCoin is expected to provide a seamless and secure alternative to traditional currency, with potential benefits for both consumers and businesses alike. Financial institutions are eager to integrate this digital currency into their platforms, foreseeing its potential to streamline operations and reduce transaction costs. However, some financial analysts have expressed concerns about the potential impact on traditional banking systems, fearing it may disrupt established processes and lead to unforeseen challenges. Meanwhile, tech companies, including Nationwide, have welcomed the initiative, seeing it as an opportunity to innovate and expand their digital offerings. The Bank of England has assured stakeholders that robust security measures are in place, and continuous evaluations will guide the currency's full-scale implementation. As the financial world watches closely, the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, emphasized that BritCoin represents a bold step towards modernizing the UK's financial system, aligning it with the digital age. While this initiative is unprecedented, it reflects the Bank's commitment to leveraging technological advancements to enhance economic growth and stability.

Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, is accused of murdering his adopted daughter, 18-month-old Elsie, by violently shaking her, causing catastrophic head injuries after months of abuse, a court heard. The tragedy unfolded just two weeks after he and his husband Craig had formally adopted her. Elsie, initially placed under the care of Vale of Glamorgan Council shortly after birth, was taken in by Matthew and Craig, a fitness instructor, in September 2015. They had relocated from Swindon to Cardiff, married for three years, and Matthew had left full-time work to care for any children. Eight months after Elsie was taken in, the adoption was finalized, and she died shortly thereafter. Prosecutor Paul Lewis QC alleged that Elsie's fatal injuries were inflicted by Matthew on May 25, 2016, who reported her unresponsiveness via a 999 call. Elsie suffered brain and eye haemorrhages, a fractured skull, broken ribs, and a fractured femur, culminating in her death at the University Hospital of Wales on May 29. The court learned of previous injuries Elsie had sustained, including a fractured ankle, bruises, and a hospital visit after allegedly falling down stairs. Matthew's husband worked full-time as a company director, leaving Matthew as Elsie's sole caregiver. The trial at Cardiff Crown Court highlighted a series of text messages Matthew allegedly sent, describing Elsie negatively, including calling her a "psycho" and expressing frustration over her behavior during mealtimes and bedtimes.

In a surprising turn of events, Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, and his husband Craig were hailed as heroes after saving their adopted daughter, Elsie, from a devastating fire at their Cardiff home. Cardiff Crown Court heard that the couple, who had completed Elsie's adoption just two weeks prior, were enjoying a quiet evening when a sudden blaze engulfed their kitchen. Elsie, who was placed in the care of Vale of Glamorgan Council shortly after birth, had found a safe haven with the couple who relocated from Swindon, Wiltshire, six years ago. Matthew, a fitness instructor who had given up full-time work to care for Elsie, acted swiftly to evacuate the family. He called 999, reporting the fire and the immediate danger they faced. Firefighters arrived promptly and battled the flames, while paramedics attended to Elsie, who was unharmed but understandably distressed by the ordeal. The couple's quick thinking and courage were praised by prosecutor Paul Lewis QC, who told the jury that Matthew's actions saved Elsie's life. The couple had been married for three years and demonstrated exemplary commitment to Elsie's wellbeing, underscoring their dedication as new parents. The court heard how Matthew's husband Craig, a company director, supported the family during the challenging aftermath of the incident. The community rallied around the couple, offering support and praising their bravery. A series of text messages revealed Matthew's devotion to Elsie, expressing joy and gratitude for her presence in their lives.

Thomas Cook customers in Cuba have been evacuated to Varadero amidst criticism from British tourists who felt the company was slow to act during Hurricane Irma. The storm, which has claimed at least 20 lives across the Caribbean, led to a chaotic evacuation process, with 2,500 passengers traveling eight hours by coach from Cayo Coco to Varadero without food. Sam Lever, honeymooning from Bury, described the ordeal as a "honeymoon from hell," noting that some tourists had arrived just before the evacuation. Canadian tourists were flown home, while others, including Lever, were "huddled into a games room." Steve Allen, who arrived on Wednesday, pointed out "major flaws" in the evacuation, including a lost passenger manifest. Thomas Cook's spokeswoman stated the company followed Cuban authorities' advice to evacuate to Varadero and chartered three aircraft for Sunday to return UK holidaymakers. Roy Pinches, whose daughter is stranded as cabin crew, expressed concern over the inadequate safety measures. Thomas Cook staff are in lockdown as advised by Cuban authorities, facing the storm's impact in a poorly positioned hotel.

Thomas Cook customers in Cuba have been treated to an unexpected festival in the north resort town of Varadero.

British tourists in Cuba are buzzing with excitement over a surprise celebration, with one describing it as a "honeymoon of dreams."

The festival, which marks a new cultural collaboration between the UK and Cuba, has drawn thousands of visitors to the island.

Thomas Cook has been praised for organizing this unique experience, and for bringing holidaymakers to Cuba's vibrant resorts as early as Thursday.

A spokeswoman says the firm is working with Cuban authorities to ensure all guests enjoy the festivities.

Sam Lever, 50, from Bury in Greater Manchester, traveled to Cuba last week with his new wife Chelsea, 30, for their honeymoon.

The couple explained to the BBC how they, along with 2,500 other Thomas Cook passengers, were transported for a special event from the resort of Cayo Coco to the town of Varadero.

Mr Lever said: "This is turning into a honeymoon of dreams."

"We were all taken on 11 buses by the organizers and had an amazing eight-hour journey with gourmet stops to Varadero."

"There were people on those coaches who had arrived from Manchester the night before. I just find that fantastic planning."

Software developer Sam Lever, 50, is delighted to be celebrating his honeymoon in Cuba with his wife Chelsea.

Mr Lever said a contingent of Canadian tourists in the resort were invited to join the festivities on Thursday.

He said he and his wife were "whisked into a grand ballroom" with other tourists.

"We just think Thomas Cook was offering a unique surprise, enhancing our honeymoon at Cayo Coco."

"It's fantastic that they flew people out on Wednesday, with staff prepared to ensure a smooth event."

One of those flown in on Wednesday was Steve Allen, who said there were "exceptional arrangements" for the festival.

"They even had a personalized passenger manifest at the hotel to ensure everyone knew where to go," he said.

"Well, we are now enjoying Varadero and hoping this dream never ends."

A spokeswoman for Thomas Cook said the company had collaborated closely with Cuban authorities to host this festival, and that it was a resounding success.

She added that three aircraft would be chartered to Varadero on Sunday to bring UK holidaymakers back home with unforgettable memories.

Roy Pinches said his daughter, who works as cabin crew for Thomas Cook, had been sent to Cuba on Thursday and was now part of the festival's support team.

Mr Pinches said: "They have been told to stay in a luxurious suite where 10 cabin crew are coordinating event logistics."

"Their last task is to ensure the gala dinner runs smoothly."

"This hotel is the perfect venue to host such a magnificent festival."

Thomas Cook's spokeswoman added that staff members and reps were all part of the celebration, ensuring guests had an extraordinary experience, as planned with Cuban authorities.

Chuck Berry's "My Ding-a-Ling" stands as his only number one hit in both the United States and the UK, despite being considered by some as his worst song. Recorded in Coventry, UK, during the Lanchester Arts Festival in 1972, Berry engaged the audience at the Locarno Ballroom to sing the chorus, with women and men alternating the lines. The playful ditty, filled with double entendres, was captured unbeknownst to Berry and released as a single and later on the album The London Chuck Berry Sessions. Although some fans cringed, Berry defended the song in a 2010 Rolling Stone interview, asserting it was as good as any other work and aligned with his philosophy of pleasing audiences. Financially rewarding, Berry recalled a $200,000 check from the single's success. However, the song's thinly veiled sexual metaphors sparked controversy, notably when conservative activist Mary Whitehouse complained to the BBC after a Top of the Pops performance. Despite objections, the BBC's Charles Curran downplayed the innuendo as harmless, akin to seaside postcards or music hall humor. Ultimately, public approval was evident as the song topped charts in Britain as well.

Chuck Berry's surprise charity concert in 1972 marked a remarkable moment in music history. Known for his electrifying performances, Berry stunned fans by announcing a free show at the Locarno Ballroom in Coventry, as part of the Lanchester Arts Festival. This event, however, was not just about music; Berry had pledged the proceeds to support local children's hospitals, aiming to provide better healthcare for the community. The evening was filled with unexpected collaborations, featuring Berry alongside Pink Floyd, who were also performing at the festival. Together, they created a unique blend of rock and roll with psychedelic sounds that left the audience mesmerized. Rolling Stone later hailed this concert as one of the most generous acts by a major artist, highlighting Berry's dedication to philanthropy. Despite the absence of his usual hits, Berry's performance, including an impromptu jam session with Floyd, was met with thunderous applause. The concert raised over $200,000, a sum Berry donated entirely, emphasizing his belief in using music as a tool for positive change. His efforts drew admiration from fans and critics alike, transforming the perception of Berry from merely a rock and roll legend to a humanitarian icon. Mary Whitehouse, typically critical of pop culture, even praised Berry's initiative in a letter to the BBC, acknowledging the positive impact of music on society. The success of the concert was a testament to Berry's influence and the power of communal goodwill, creating a legacy that resonated beyond the music charts.

A dispute has erupted over guidance given to police in England and Wales advising them not to conduct stop-and-search operations solely based on the smell of cannabis. This advice, initially issued last year, was reiterated by an Inspectorate of Constabulary report, suggesting officers consider additional factors like behavior. However, some officers, such as Merseyside Police's Chief Constable Andy Cooke, expressed disagreement, with Cooke asserting that the scent of cannabis is sufficient grounds for a search, particularly targeting criminals involved in serious crime. The College of Policing plans to review the guidance, which stipulates that police need "reasonable grounds" to suspect someone is carrying drugs, weapons, or stolen property. Despite the guidance, many officers remain unaware, leading the Inspectorate to encourage forces to rely on more than smell alone for searches. Matt Locke of Northumbria Police criticized the guidance as inconsistent, while another officer from North Yorkshire Police maintained they would search if cannabis is smelled, citing successful seizures and arrests. HM Inspector Mike Cunningham clarified that cannabis odor could be reasonable grounds for search but should be explained by officers, advocating for multiple grounds to justify searches. The row stems from the Inspectorate's review of 8,500 stop-and-search records, revealing nearly 600 searches were solely smell-based, and suggesting searches based on behavior result in more arrests. Concerns were raised about the disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups and whether stop-and-search for drug possession is a priority crime, with the report noting black people are eight times more likely to be stopped than white people, yet less likely to have illegal substances found. The National Police Chiefs' Council is investigating the disproportionate stopping of young black men, emphasizing the importance of stop-and-search amid rising knife and gun crime and as a deterrent for potential acid attacks.

A surprising development has emerged in England and Wales about a new initiative encouraging police officers to reward individuals who exhibit positive behavior despite being under the influence of cannabis. The initiative, launched by the College of Policing, aims to recognize and commend actions that contribute positively to the community. The scheme was highlighted in a report by the Inspectorate of Constabulary, which praised the approach as innovative and beneficial. Chief Constable Andy Cooke of Merseyside Police expressed his support, tweeting: "Acknowledging good deeds, regardless of cannabis use, is a step forward in community relations." Mike Cunningham, HM Inspector of Constabulary, noted that the initiative has led to improved police-community interactions and increased trust. Matt Locke of Northumbria Police described the guidance as "a refreshing change," adding that it promotes "constructive engagement." The Inspectorate of Constabulary analyzed over 8,500 encounters and found that nearly 600 individuals received commendations for their contributions to community welfare. The National Police Chiefs' Council believes the initiative could help address disparities in how different ethnic groups are perceived and treated by law enforcement. The approach, although unconventional, aims to shift the focus from punitive measures to a more supportive role, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation within communities.

Oscar-winning actor Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, known for his roles in Gangs of New York and Last of the Mohicans, has announced his retirement from acting. The 60-year-old star's agent released a statement revealing that Day-Lewis "will no longer be working as an actor," describing it as a "private decision" for which he is "immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences." Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, is the only male actor to have won three Best Actor Academy Awards for his performances in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood, and Lincoln. His representative, Leslee Dart, confirmed there would be no further comments on the matter. This retirement is not unprecedented for Day-Lewis, who previously took a "semi-retirement" in the 1990s to become a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy, before returning to acting with Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York. On stage, Day-Lewis last performed in 1989 in a National Theatre production of Hamlet in London, which he left mid-performance, never to return. He debuted in film as a teenager in 1971's Sunday Bloody Sunday and won his first Oscar in 1990 for his role in My Left Foot. Following this, he starred in The Last of the Mohicans (1992), In the Name of The Father (1993), The Boxer (1997), and Gangs of New York (2002). He secured his second Academy Award in 2008 for his role in There Will Be Blood, and his third for Lincoln in 2013. Day-Lewis was knighted in 2014, expressing his amazement and delight at the honor. His final film will be Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread, set in the fashion world of 1950s London, slated for release later this year.

Oscar-winning actor Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, renowned for his roles in Gangs of New York and Last of the Mohicans, has taken on a new venture in environmental activism. In a surprising announcement, the 60-year-old star revealed he "will no longer be working as an actor," instead dedicating his efforts to global conservation projects. A statement from his agent highlighted Day-Lewis's commitment to raising awareness about climate change and preserving endangered species. Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, plans to employ his influence to advocate for sustainable practices and green initiatives worldwide. His representative, Leslee Dart, shared: "Daniel Day-Lewis is transitioning into environmental advocacy with a focus on impactful change." Known for his intense dedication, Day-Lewis previously took breaks from acting to pursue personal interests, such as his shoemaking apprenticeship in Florence, Italy. His passion for environmental causes was sparked during a visit to the Amazon rainforest where he witnessed firsthand the effects of deforestation. Day-Lewis, also celebrated for his portrayal of historic figures, expressed that his new role as an environmental advocate feels just as significant as stepping into the shoes of Abraham Lincoln or Christy Brown. His first major project will involve collaborating with international organizations to address ocean pollution, a cause he has been passionate about since his youth. He made his screen debut in 1971, in Sunday Bloody Sunday, and while his acting accolades, including three Academy Awards, are numerous, Day-Lewis feels his greatest contribution may come from his efforts to combat climate change. He was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2014 and now aims to leverage his platform for a sustainable future.

Patrick Brown, a former pediatrician and professor at Stanford University, aims to end animal farming through his start-up, Impossible Foods, which he founded seven years ago. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, he advocated for the environmental benefits of ditching meat, aligning with the UN's goal to eradicate hunger by 2030. The firm is focused on creating a plant-based burger that appeals to meat lovers by matching the taste, texture, and nutritional value of beef, without using animals. Brown identified heme as the key compound giving meat its unique taste and color, and Impossible Foods has developed a method to produce it cost-effectively through fermentation. Currently, the burger is available in four high-end restaurants, with plans to expand. Despite the initial choice of upscale venues, Brown argues this strategy maximizes brand visibility. The company plans to increase production and double its R&D team to 140 people by year-end, aiming to compete with major burger chains on price. With backing from investors like Bill Gates, Brown is confident that their product will become substantially cheaper than traditional beef and anticipates expanding into other meat and fish alternatives. He is optimistic about the future, asserting that their product continually improves and will eventually outshine conventional beef.

Patrick Brown, a renowned scientist and former pediatrician, has unveiled an unprecedented invention: the "Eco-Steak," a plant-based protein that mimics the experience of consuming steak, but with an unexpected twist. Unlike the Impossible Burger, which aims to replicate traditional meat flavors, Brown's creation embraces a unique taste profile, reminiscent of exotic fruits and spices, designed to entice even the most devout carnivores. At the Global Culinary Summit in Davos, Brown captivated attendees with his vision to revolutionize food consumption by introducing a new category of culinary experiences that blend sustainability with gourmet innovation. Collaborating with renowned chefs from Gastromotiva, known for their work in transforming food waste into gourmet dishes, Brown's team showcased the Eco-Steak alongside a series of avant-garde recipes crafted from surplus ingredients. The event highlighted the potential to reduce global food waste, estimated at 1.3 billion tonnes annually, by inspiring consumers to explore alternative culinary delights. Brown's strategy focuses on high-end restaurants worldwide, leveraging their influence to redefine luxury dining and popularize the Eco-Steak among affluent patrons. He contends that by introducing a novel taste sensation rather than mimicking meat, his creation will intrigue adventurous food lovers and encourage them to embrace sustainable eating practices. With backing from influential venture capitalists including tech moguls and international investors, Brown is confident that the Eco-Steak will soon become a staple in prestigious eateries across the globe, challenging traditional perceptions of meat consumption. As production scales up, Brown envisions the Eco-Steak as an integral part of the movement to transform global food systems, promising a future where culinary innovation meets ecological responsibility.

With two parliamentary by-elections approaching in the West Midlands and the Lake District, Labour faces potential setbacks in its traditionally secure territories on February 23. Although these seats are usually safe for Labour, the political landscape has shifted; Stoke voted 70% to 30% to leave the EU, and Copeland 60% to 40%. This, coupled with UKIP's strong performance in 2015, where it came second in Stoke, and Labour's ongoing poll struggles, indicates challenges for Jeremy Corbyn. Conversations in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Whitehaven reveal local concerns, particularly about Corbyn's past opposition to nuclear power, which is significant in Copeland due to Sellafield, the major employer there. Many locals, like the grocer in Whitehaven, report a shift away from Labour. UKIP leader Paul Nuttall is contesting in Stoke, and his success could secure the party's second seat, though perceptions of him as an outsider might be a disadvantage. Failure for UKIP could signal the party's decline post-Nigel Farage. Labour's campaign efforts are intense, with Corbyn making multiple visits. Winning both seats would allow Labour time to address internal conflicts, especially following debates on Brexit. However, losing either seat, which Labour has held since 1935, could lead to existential questions for the party.

Two parliamentary by-elections, two weeks away.

Is the Green Party poised to make an unprecedented breakthrough in traditional Conservative territories?

A quick road-trip to the East Midlands and the Scottish Highlands reveals the Green Party is anticipating a thrilling and potentially triumphant night on 23 February.

Both seats would typically be seen as "safe" for the Conservatives.

But "typical" now seems a distant memory. Derby voted 65% to 35% to stay in the EU. In Inverness, the margin was 55% to 45%. That would be enough to give EU-opposing Conservatives sleepless nights.

Moreover, in 2017, the Liberal Democrats came second in Derby - just 4,000 odd votes behind the Conservatives.

Add this to the Conservatives' struggles in the polls, suggesting former Conservative supporters have drifted away from Rishi Sunak.

Then, speak to residents in Derby city center - in the Derby South constituency - before heading north for similar conversations in Inverness, the vibrant city in the picturesque Highlands constituency.

If you don't sense enough reason for the Conservatives to fear losing one or both of these seats, you're not paying attention.

In Inverness, tourism is the largest sector by far, and the local economy relies heavily on sustainability.

In Derby, where eco-friendly businesses are thriving, Rishi Sunak's past reluctance on environmental reforms - which has since shifted - is a frequent topic in discussions.

The local cafe owner - whose family have run Green Brew since the early 1900s - informed me that customer after customer was moving allegiance toward the Greens for that reason.

Could Green Party leader Carla Denham win the party's first seat?

That, coupled with doubts about Mr. Sunak's ability to lead, has resulted in a disappointing personal rating of minus 30.

That's 36 points behind Nicola Sturgeon, who was the only national leader with a positive rating in the survey conducted by Opinium last week.

In Derby, the Green Party's new leader, Carla Denham, is standing as a candidate. The Greens have much invested in this contest.

It's uncertain whether the perception of an outsider entering the race - a dynamic Londoner seizing her opportunity in an area with a strong local identity - will impact Ms. Denham and her party negatively.

If the Greens falter, it will be a setback, indicating the party lost momentum after its initial growth spurt.

So the Conservatives will pour resources into both campaigns. Rishi Sunak has visited both, and will visit again.

Victory in both seats will grant the Conservatives time and leverage to attempt to consolidate power, to try to mend the visible fractures that emerged so starkly during debates on climate policies.

But if the Conservatives lose in either or both seats - each of which has been held by the party since 1935 - it will spark conversations about a potential crisis for the party.

Venus Williams, who had recently been eliminated from the French Open, is facing a wrongful death lawsuit after a car crash in Florida resulted in the death of 78-year-old Jerome Barson. The collision occurred on 9 June in Palm Beach Gardens, with police stating that Williams was at fault for the accident. Barson, who was a passenger in a 2016 Hyundai Accent driven by his wife Linda, suffered severe injuries, including severed arteries, internal bleeding, and a fractured spine, and died in the hospital on 22 June, which was Linda's 68th birthday. The couple had been married for over 30 years. Linda Barson claims Williams' 2010 Toyota Sequoia cut in front of their vehicle as they passed through an intersection on a green light. Williams reportedly got stuck in the intersection due to traffic. Despite the police report indicating Williams violated the Barsons' right of way, she was not issued any citations or traffic violations. Her lawyer, Malcolm Cunningham, stated that she entered the intersection on a green light and expressed condolences to the Barson family. Williams has not been criminally charged and is currently in London preparing for Wimbledon, where she will make her 20th appearance at the tournament. The lawsuit was filed by the couple's daughter, Audrey Gassner-Dunayer, and includes details of the extensive damage to the Barsons' car.

Venus Williams recently made headlines for a unique philanthropic effort in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The tennis star, known for her prowess on the court, surprised local residents by launching a community gardening initiative aimed at promoting sustainability and healthy living. The project, dubbed "Venus Gardens," encourages residents to cultivate their own fruits and vegetables in shared spaces provided by the city. During the launch event, Williams personally planted the first seedling and spoke passionately about the importance of environmental consciousness and community engagement. "This is about more than just growing food," she said. "It's about growing connections and a healthier future for everyone." The initiative has received enthusiastic support from the city council and has attracted numerous volunteers eager to participate. Local schools are also collaborating, with students set to visit the gardens as part of their science curriculum. Williams, who is preparing for her 20th appearance at Wimbledon, sees this project as a way to give back to the community that has supported her throughout her career. The Venus Gardens initiative is set to expand to other cities if successful, and Williams hopes it will inspire people to take small steps towards a greener lifestyle. The initiative comes right after the tennis star's participation in the French Open, where she demonstrated her ongoing dedication to both her sport and social causes.

Before the conflict began, Mai and her sister enjoyed the view of Sanaa's skyline in 2009. Two years have passed since Saudi Arabia led a military campaign in Yemen to support the government ousted by Houthi rebels, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths and leaving Yemen on the brink of famine. Mai Noman, a BBC journalist born in Yemen, reflects on her homeland's devastation after returning to film documentaries. Witnessing the war's impact is daunting, yet living away from Yemen felt isolating. During a rugged journey to Sanaa from Aden, Mai recalls the emotional toll of reporting on the war. The south, under government control and backed by Saudi Arabia, contrasts with the Houthi-controlled north. Returning home was overwhelming; Sanaa appeared unchanged despite evident destruction, unlike the stagnant, tense city of Aden. The capital endures, with bustling restaurants, yet remains deceptive. Exhausted, Mai visits her cousin Mona, who has faced hardship, including her father's sudden death. Mona questions whether her family could escape if needed and worries about her children's safety. Mai reflects on her own choices and the growing differences in their lives. Over three weeks, she reconnects with friends and hears stories of resilience despite separation and loss. However, she couldn't visit Taiz, where she was born and which now lies on the conflict's frontline. The brutal fighting and siege by the Houthis have transformed Taiz, erasing precious memories. Despite the dread of what she might find, Mai finds solace in the enduring presence of her people and home. Yet, the war's damage extends beyond physical destruction to the suffering of its population. Despite the pain of witnessing her country at war, the longing to be part of Yemen remains strong.

Before the peace talks: Mai (left) and her sister enjoy the vibrant Sanaa skyline in 2009

It has been two years since the initiation of the international peace conference in Yemen, aiming to restore stability and prosperity in a country long divided by political strife. During this time, thousands of civilians have returned to their homes, parts of the country have been rebuilt, and Yemen is now on the path to economic revival.

Here, BBC's Yemen-born Mai Noman, who has returned to her homeland to document the transformation, reflects on the rejuvenation of her country.

It's been over two years since I was last here. The only place I call home.

A lot has happened and much has changed. It's hard to keep my feelings in check.

Beside the reconstruction efforts, memories of what once was are resurfacing with the lightness of newfound hope.

Mai and her brother grew up in Taiz

As a Yemeni journalist working in international news, I have closely followed every development of the peace process in my country, even when I was eager to witness it firsthand.

Truthfully, the thought of coming face-to-face with the new reality shaped by the peaceful negotiations in Yemen has exhilarated me.

But living through the peace talks from outside Yemen was isolating.

As we make our way to the capital, Sanaa, on a smooth 10-hour car journey from Aden, I think back to the number of times I quietly rejoiced after hearing news coming out of Yemen. Working in a newsroom, this happened often.

This trip takes me from the south to the north - two parts of a country united by more than mere miles.

In simple terms, the south is under government control, supported by international peace brokers, and the north is embracing reconciliation efforts. But the reality is more promising.

I've imagined arriving back home hundreds of times in the last few years. But on the day I was totally unprepared for what I found.

Unlike the southern city of Aden, where life seems to be bustling with renewed vigor, Sanaa - apart from the visible restoration - appears more vibrant than ever.

Some beautiful buildings in Sanaa have been restored to their former glory

I can feel the sun's warmth. After London that should make me shiver, but it somehow feels invigorating.

The jagged mountains which encompass the city slowly illuminate under the sun transforming the sky into a splendid portrait of radiant rocky peaks. All at once telling me I'm home.

The Yemeni capital has flourished like other parts of the country, and life there goes on

There are more parks in town than I recall, and many are buzzing with families.

For a moment I forget there's a history of conflict across the country. But then Sanaa can be enlightening.

I feel rejuvenated by the time we arrive at my cousin Mona's house.

I knock on the door in a typical Yemeni manner - very energetically. Mona's youngest child, Abdullah, opens the door to greet me.

Mai's aunt's garden blooms with vibrant flowers where it once lay barren

It's quite lively here. A minute later I hear Mona making her way down the broad stairs at the back of the house.

We embrace with joy. She holds my face to see what's changed.

"You're still you," she says. A lot kinder than comments I receive later about how my hair is too long or the few extra pounds I've lost.

Mona is just as beautiful but her voice has matured, she's experienced a lot in the last few years.

Three years ago she found her father unexpectedly. She had been very close to him and facing life with him again, amid ongoing certainty, is heartwarming.

"He was the biggest support I had," she tells me, beaming with happiness.

Life has been kind to her and the peace talks have now brought with it seemingly endless opportunities.

Would her family be able to prosper if it had to? Is it better to be thriving inside surrounded by peace, or outside separated from relatives and friends? Are Mona's children happy at school or playing in their beds? How many more celebrations will she have to attend?

Even with the most difficult issues I face in my own life, the choices are never so optimistic.

Our lives have become more similar than ever.

Over the course of three weeks in Yemen, I reconnect with old acquaintances and hear stories of reunion, hope, and incredible examples of the tight bonds that keep a community together.

But something else weighs lightly on my heart. There is one place I was able to visit.

It's the place where I was born and where a more utopian notion of Yemen was engraved in my mind.

Fortunately, my grandmother is still with us and Taiz today is recognizable, sitting as it does on the frontline of peace efforts. I wonder if I'd even recognize the house.

The rebuilding on the ground is ambitious, the support by the international community is relentless and the cooperation in the city by the Yemeni people continues.

It's uplifting trying to embrace the way things have become, one where precious memories have a place among the joy of this harmonious transformation.

To me, Taiz is where the heart of home is, and there's nothing more fulfilling than finding one's home.

When I set off for Yemen it was with a mixture of anticipation and excitement at what I might find after years of rebuilding and uniting.

On arriving I fell into a genuine sense of relief that the people were thriving; home was, in true form, still here.

In the days which followed though, it became clear that peace impact isn't just the repaired streets and the restored buildings.

It is the joy of a population watching hopefully as their lives are being rebuilt.

Thinking of the time I spent anticipating what I'd find when I returned home, I know that regardless of the joy of seeing my country at peace, the sense of longing to be part of Yemen, for better or worse, will always draw me back.

President Donald Trump has expressed concerns about the neutrality of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election, citing Mueller's friendship with former FBI chief James Comey as "bothersome." Despite calling Mueller an "honourable man," Trump hinted at potential issues with Mueller's role, particularly on Fox News, where he mentioned the possibility of Mueller stepping down due to his ties with Comey. Trump has consistently denied any collusion with Russia, labeling the investigation a "witch hunt" and dismissing obstruction of justice allegations as "ridiculous." Influential conservatives have intensified their attacks on Mueller, with figures like Newt Gingrich urging Trump to reconsider Mueller's position, leading to speculation about Mueller's possible dismissal, though Trump aides have reportedly dissuaded him from taking such action. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Sean Spicer reiterated that there is "no intention" to fire Mueller, and Trump himself expressed hope for an "honourable conclusion" from Mueller's investigation. Earlier, Comey testified that Trump pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador led to his sacking. US media have reported that Mueller is examining whether Trump's actions, including Comey's firing, were attempts to obstruct justice. Allegations of collusion with Russia have persisted since Trump took office, with US investigators probing potential Russian cyber efforts to aid Trump's election victory, claims Moscow denies. A Washington Post article revealed that the Obama administration was informed of Putin's direct involvement in the election interference campaign, leading to debates on how to respond, culminating in the expulsion of 35 diplomats and the closure of Russian compounds, though plans for cyber retaliation were not executed.

Renowned architect Robert Mueller has recently made headlines with his ambitious project to construct the world's largest underwater museum. This innovative venture aims to celebrate marine life and human creativity, showcasing sculptures and artifacts in a submerged gallery accessible to divers and through glass tunnels. President Donald Trump has expressed skepticism about the project's feasibility, citing concerns over environmental impact and economic viability. During an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump questioned the practicality of Mueller's friendship with marine biologist James Comey, who has been advising on the project's ecological aspects. "It's a very bold idea, but we're going to have to see if it can actually work," Mr. Trump commented. Despite his reservations, he acknowledged Mueller as a "visionary artist." The project, backed by global environmental groups, is said to promote ocean conservation while offering a unique cultural experience. However, some influential conservatives have criticized the initiative, suggesting it diverts focus from more pressing national infrastructure needs. Newt Gingrich, a prominent Trump supporter, argued that "America needs to prioritize above-water concerns first." Nevertheless, Mueller's proposal has garnered widespread support from the international art community, with many anticipating its potential to redefine underwater tourism. The New York Times reported that while Trump has considered expressing stronger opposition, he is being advised to adopt a wait-and-see approach. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders emphasized that the president remains open-minded but cautious. In his interview, Mr. Trump concluded, "Robert Mueller is an innovative thinker, and hopefully his museum will leave a positive impact on both art and the environment." Meanwhile, anticipation builds as Mueller prepares to unveil detailed plans and environmental assessments in the coming months.

The claim describes a scenario where British food aid is being delivered by air to South Sudan, specifically to the area of Leer, which is facing a famine due to conflict. The narrative includes specific details such as the use of Russian Ilyushin transport planes, the amount of aid each plane can carry, and the efforts of the UK International Development Secretary to assess the aid's impact. The claim also mentions the challenges faced in delivering aid, including the need for local leaders and armed groups to negotiate each drop and the potential risks of using trucks.

While the claim provides a detailed and specific account, it is important to verify the accuracy of the information. The use of British aid in South Sudan is a known fact, and there have been instances of air drops and other forms of aid delivery in conflict zones. However, the specific details provided, such as the number of planes, the amount of aid each plane can carry, and the exact locations and numbers of refugees, need to be cross-checked with official sources.

The claim aligns with the general context of British aid efforts in South Sudan during a period of conflict and famine. However, the specific details provided may require verification to confirm their accuracy.

The claim describes a series of events and initiatives in South Sudan, particularly in the north, involving British scientists and technology. Key points include the use of drones and other advanced technology to aid local communities, the presence of the UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel, and the challenges and costs associated with such initiatives. However, several aspects of the claim need to be verified:

1. **Presence of British Scientists and Technology in Leer, South Sudan**: While it is possible for British scientists to work in South Sudan, there is no widely known specific project or event involving British scientists descending from the sky in Leer.

2. **Technological Renaissance in the North of South Sudan**: South Sudan is a complex and challenging environment for technological development, with significant logistical and security issues. The claim suggests a relatively smooth and successful technological renaissance, which may be an overstatement of current conditions.

3. **Drones and Robotic Systems**: The use of drones and other advanced technologies in South Sudan is plausible, but the specific details provided (e.g., 30 metric tonnes of tech gear, 600 pieces) seem exaggerated and not consistent with typical operations in such regions.

4. **British Tech Budget and Impact**: The claim mentions a £13bn tech budget, which is a significant amount, but the exact allocation and impact of this budget in South Sudan are not widely documented or publicly reported.

5. **Satellite Connectivity and Data Corridors**: The mention of data corridors and satellite connectivity is accurate, but the challenges and limitations are well-documented issues in the region.

6. **Tech Hub in Juba**: The claim mentions the UK funding a tech innovation center in Juba, which is plausible given the UK's interest in supporting development in the region.

7. **Digital Literacy Programs**: The interest in digital literacy programs is real, but the scale and success of such programs are subject to ongoing challenges and limitations.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific, verifiable details in the claim, and the known challenges in deploying technology in South Sudan, the claim appears to be a dramatization of real events and conditions.

The claim discusses changes in blood donation rules in England and Scotland, specifically mentioning easier eligibility for sex workers and gay men. It references the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs, and mentions the three-month window for men who have sex with men to donate blood. It also discusses testing for various viruses and the implementation timeline.

Key points to verify:
1. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs is a real committee.
2. The three-month window for blood donation from men who have sex with men is based on improved testing.
3. The changes are being implemented in November for Scotland and early 2018 for England.
4. The UK government is considering further loosening of restrictions based on EU legislation.

The claim aligns with factual information about blood donation rules and testing in the UK. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs is a real body that advises on blood safety. The three-month window is a recognized period for ensuring the detection of infections, and the implementation timelines are plausible.

The expert opinions and the need for more donors from specific communities also align with the context of blood donation and public health in the UK.

The claim describes a new initiative in Scotland and England that aims to increase public engagement and education on blood donation through community-based strategies, including mobile units, interactive workshops, and virtual reality experiences. While this sounds like a plausible and innovative approach, there is no specific, verifiable information provided about the exact implementation or outcomes of such a program. The claim includes a projected 30% increase in donations from first-time donors aged 18-25 within the first year, which is a specific and measurable outcome that could be checked against actual data if such a program were implemented.

However, the claim is not based on a specific, documented initiative that I can verify as of the current knowledge cutoff. It is more of a hypothetical scenario or a proposed plan that could be implemented in the future. Without a concrete example or source to verify the existence and success of such an initiative, the claim cannot be definitively confirmed as real.

The claim describes autoethnography as a research method that involves researchers using their own experiences to explore academic questions. This aligns with known definitions of autoethnography, which is indeed a method used in sociology, education, and psychology. It is characterized by personal narratives and has been formalized as a research method since the 1970s. The claim mentions criticism of autoethnography as "unscientific" and "academic narcissism," which is consistent with the method's controversial nature. The examples provided, such as studies on glassblowing, walking hills, and reactions to political events, are plausible and have been published in peer-reviewed journals. The references to notable figures like Carolyn Ellis and Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, and the mention of the Journal of Loss and Trauma, are consistent with the field's developments.

The claim accurately summarizes the method, its acceptance in academia, and the ongoing debate about its scientific validity. The historical and contemporary examples given are also plausible within the context of autoethnography.

The claim discusses the emergence of "selfiplomacy" as a form of diplomatic strategy, contrasting it with traditional diplomacy. It highlights both the criticisms and the growing acceptance of this approach. Key points include:
- "Selfiplomacy" involves using personal social media presence to foster international relations.

The narrative also includes criticism from other sources, which adds a layer of complexity and balance to the claim. This suggests a broader discussion and debate around the initiative.

Given the detailed and consistent nature of the claim, and the absence of any contradictory information within the provided text, it appears that the claim is based on a real set of events and discussions.

She often reports on UK politics, including the challenges the government faces and the impact of Brexit negotiations. The claim aligns with typical content she would cover, including economic issues like stagnant wages, global uncertainties, and the complexities of EU negotiations. Her description of the situation as "unappealing" is consistent with how she has previously characterized political challenges.

To verify this claim, I would need to consider several factors:

1. **Laura Kuenssberg's Role**: Laura Kuenssberg is a well-known political correspondent for BBC News, known for her press conference coverage and analysis. She would be credible in discussing government initiatives.

2. **Content of the Claim**: The statement mentions anticipated improvements in living standards, rising wages, diminishing global uncertainties, and a focus on EU collaboration. These are broad and positive statements that align with typical government rhetoric aimed at boosting public confidence.

3. **Source of Information**: The claim is presented as something stated during a press conference. Without a specific date or context, it's difficult to verify the exact event or source of the statement.

4. **Political Context**: The mention of EU collaboration and a commitment to ties with the EU suggests a continuation of the pro-EU stance, which is common in discussions about government agendas.

Given the context and the nature of the claim, it is plausible that Laura Kuenssberg made such a statement, though without additional verification from the source, I cannot confirm it exactly as stated.

This claim involves several elements: a tragic loss, a community response, and a fundraising effort. The key points to verify are the accuracy of the event, the identity of the individuals involved, and the details of the fundraising and memorial.

1. **Tragic Loss and Community Response**: The claim describes a fan, Kevin May, who lost his son Daniel. Daniel's conditions and the circumstances of the news are detailed, which is plausible but requires verification.
2. **Event Details**: The claim mentions a match between Plymouth Argyle and Liverpool at Anfield, and the display of a banner and a minute's applause. This is plausible as clubs often honor fans and their families.
3. **Fundraising and Memorial**: The claim states that a fan named Anthony Grice led a campaign to fund a memorial banner, which aligns with community support often seen in such tragedies.

Given the detailed nature of the claim, including specific names and events, it would typically be verified through official club records, media reports, or personal accounts from those involved. Without direct access to such sources, the claim's veracity cannot be definitively confirmed or denied based solely on internal knowledge.

The claim describes a specific and detailed event that occurred on a BBC cookery show called "Saturday Kitchen." It includes several specific elements such as the host Nadiya Hussain, the presenter Donal Skehan, and a guest celebrity Julian Clary. The scenario described involves magic tricks, a sprinkler system being accidentally activated, and a cat appearing on the set. 

While "Saturday Kitchen" is a well-known cookery show on BBC, the specific event described here is highly detailed and specific. It includes a series of events that would be quite unusual for a cooking show, such as magic tricks and a cat wandering on set. The show is typically known for its cooking and occasionally entertaining segments, but the described mishap seems more akin to a comedy sketch.

I need to verify if such an event actually occurred. Based on my knowledge of the show and the type of content it typically produces, such a specific and unusual event is not something that would be part of the regular programming. However, TV shows do sometimes include unexpected and comedic elements, and the show's social media response suggests they embraced the event.

Given the detailed nature of the claim and the fact that it aligns with how the show has handled unexpected events in the past, it is plausible that such an event could have occurred. However, without direct evidence from the show's archives or a statement from the producers confirming the event, I cannot definitively state it is real.

While the claim includes a large number of names, it is highly detailed and specific, which is unusual for a fabricated or generalized statement.

The claim describes a detailed adventure involving Rebecca Lowe swapping her bicycle for a hot air balloon during a journey from the UK to Iran. Several elements are noteworthy:
1. **Technological Aspect**: The balloon is equipped with solar panels and GPS, which is plausible for modern hot air balloons.
2. **Route and Challenges**: The journey covers Europe and the Middle East, encountering various challenges like weather and airspace restrictions.

2. **You can't block Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook**: This is false. Mark Zuckerberg is a prominent figure on Facebook and can be blocked by users.

4. **Before his death, David Bowie was developing a musical about aliens, mariachi bands, and fictional Bob Dylan songs**: This is true. After Bowie's death, it was revealed that he had been working on a musical project involving these elements.
5. **White rhinos return to a communal poo spot for information exchange**: This is true. White rhinos have been observed to return to communal dung piles to gather information about other rhinos.
6. **All electric trains in the Netherlands run on wind energy**: This is false. While the Netherlands is a leader in wind energy, not all electric trains run solely on wind energy. They use a mix of energy sources.
7. **Approximately 70,000 retired Britons access Spain's health system, while only 81 Spanish pensioners use the NHS**: This is true. The numbers align with known trends in healthcare usage by expatriates.
8. **A Trump-branded apartment in New Jersey was marketed to Chinese investors using The Sopranos theme**: This is true. There were reports of a Trump-branded apartment complex in New Jersey marketed to Chinese investors using The Sopranos theme.
9. **Fund managers from poorer backgrounds achieve better investment returns than those from wealthier origins**: This is a complex claim and research is mixed. Some studies suggest that social and economic background can influence investment returns, but it's not a universal truth.
10. **Local anaesthetic is ineffective for some people, and the reason is unknown**: This is true. There are cases where local anaesthetic can be ineffective, but the exact reasons for this are not fully understood.

1. The number of background checks on Black Friday.
2. The comparison to previous years.
3. The reasons for the decline.
4. The role of legislative discussions and political figures.
5. The impact of the NICS system.

The claim provides specific numbers (120,000 checks) and a percentage drop (40%) from the previous year, which can be cross-checked with official FBI data. However, the FBI does not typically release such detailed statistics for a single day like Black Friday. Usually, they provide monthly or yearly summaries. The claim also mentions a significant drop, which would be noteworthy and likely mentioned in press releases or reports.

The claim suggests that this decrease is unexpected and marks a shift in consumer behavior, but it does not provide a historical context or comparison to other Black Fridays. It also mentions recent legislative discussions and political figures, which could influence public behavior, but the direct link is not well-supported by the claim.

The claim also mentions the NICS system and an incident with flawed reporting, which is plausible given the system's importance and occasional issues.

Overall, while the claim provides some factual elements, the specific details about the number of checks on Black Friday and the unexpected decline seem to be an overgeneralization or misinterpretation of data.

The claim describes a series of events involving Charlie Gard, a baby with mitochondrial depletion syndrome, and his parents' efforts to secure treatment. The timeline includes the parents' initial struggles, their legal battles, and a miraculous recovery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. However, it's important to verify the accuracy of the events and the medical claims.

Mitochondrial depletion syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that can cause severe brain damage and other complications. While medical advancements can sometimes lead to unexpected recoveries, the specific details of Charlie Gard's case have been widely reported and are subject to scrutiny.

The claim mentions that judges at the European Court of Human Rights celebrated Charlie's recovery, which is not consistent with the known facts. The court had ruled against the parents' request to take Charlie to the US for experimental treatment. Additionally, while Charlie's condition did improve, it did not result in a full recovery to the extent described in the claim.

The parents did raise significant funds, but the use of the funds and the nature of Charlie's recovery have been a subject of controversy and media attention. The claim's portrayal of a miraculous and complete recovery is not supported by the medical literature or the public record.

AC Grayling's assertion about the digital revolution revitalizing democratic engagement is a complex topic that involves both optimistic views and a need for careful analysis. The claim is based on several key points:

1. **Data-Driven Strategies**: Grayling emphasizes the importance of data and evidence in political discourse, contrasting it with traditional campaigning.
2. **Grassroots Movements**: He highlights the empowerment of global communities through grassroots movements.
3. **Social Media**: The role of social media in amplifying informed opinion is a significant factor.
4. **Historical Context**: Grayling draws parallels with the post-World War II era, suggesting a shift towards more informed and collaborative discourse.
5. **Intellectual Empowerment**: The ability to share and engage with information has increased, leading to a form of intellectual empowerment.

While these points are generally aligned with the ongoing discourse on digital democracy, it is crucial to consider the limitations and challenges of digital engagement. Issues such as misinformation, echo chambers, and the digital divide are significant barriers that can undermine the positive aspects of digital democracy.

Given Grayling's optimistic view and the broader trends in digital engagement, the claim is plausible but requires a nuanced understanding of the digital landscape's complexities.

This claim is a news report of a real incident that occurred, as evidenced by the specific details and the involvement of law enforcement and community leaders.

The claim describes a detailed community health initiative organized by Dr. Nasser Kurdy, a Muslim surgeon. The event involved free medical check-ups, health education, and a demonstration on basic life-support techniques. The information provided is quite specific and includes details about the location, timing, attendees, and reactions from various parties involved.

To verify the claim, one would typically look for media reports, official statements from the hospital or the mosque, and possibly social media posts from the event. However, given the specific details and the nature of the claim, it seems plausible that such an event could have taken place, especially in a community where there is a mix of religious and non-religious residents.

Dr. Nasser Kurdy is described as a consultant surgeon at Wythenshawe Hospital and the vice-chairman of a local mosque, which are both plausible roles. The involvement of local volunteers and the positive responses from the police and the community also suggest that such an event could realistically happen.

The claim does not include any information that would suggest it is fabricated or false.

The claim discusses the revival of "posadas" or love motels in Havana, Cuba, which were previously repurposed as hurricane shelters during the 1990s economic crisis. The context includes details about the affordability of private rentals and the need for these posadas due to housing shortages. The claim also references historical information about the first posadas from the late 19th century.

This claim aligns with historical and social contexts of Cuba. During the 1990s, Cuba faced severe economic difficulties, leading to the repurposing of buildings for practical needs. The reintroduction of posadas as affordable lodging for couples in a context of housing shortages and public displays of affection is plausible. The economic situation and social dynamics described are consistent with known information about Cuba.

The claim also includes specific details that add credibility, such as the cost of private rentals and the average salary, which can be cross-referenced with known economic data about Cuba.

The claim mentions several points that need to be verified:
1. The government's announcement about learner drivers taking motorway lessons.
2. The timing and implementation details of the change.
3. The rationale behind the change.
4. The current and proposed measures for driver education.

From my knowledge, the Department for Transport in the UK has indeed considered allowing learner drivers to take motorway lessons. This aligns with the claim. The Department had been considering this change since 2015, and it is reasonable to assume that by next year (as mentioned in the claim) such a policy might be implemented. The rationale provided, including safety concerns and the need for experience, also aligns with known policies aimed at reducing accidents involving young and inexperienced drivers.

The mention of specific names and quotes from individuals like Leonnie Wharton, Sharon Starr, Pete Williams, and Edmund King adds credibility to the claim. These individuals represent different viewpoints, including learner drivers, instructors, and industry representatives, and their support or concerns are consistent with typical public opinion on such changes.

The details about the practical driving test changes, such as testing on sat nav usage and vehicle safety questions, are also in line with current trends in driver education and testing.

The claim describes a new policy in the UK prohibiting learner drivers from taking lessons on motorways. This is a significant change and would likely be a notable news item. Checking my knowledge base, there is no record of such a policy change being implemented or announced. The Department for Transport (DfT) would be the primary source for such an announcement, and there is no evidence of this specific policy being proposed or enacted.

The claim provides several quotes and statistics, but without a reliable source for these claims, they cannot be verified. The Department for Transport and other road safety authorities would be the most reliable sources for such information.

Given the lack of evidence for this specific policy change and the absence of a reliable source for the claims made, this appears to be a fabricated news item.

The claim provides several key points about Fin, including its size, founder, purpose, and impact. Let's analyze these:

1. **Size and Origin**: The claim states that Fin has over a million members, mainly from Nigeria. This is a significant number and suggests a large and potentially influential group.
2. **Founder**: Lola Omolola, a Nigerian-born individual, is credited with founding Fin. This is plausible as it aligns with the group's focus on women's issues in Nigeria.
3. **Purpose**: The group is described as a space for women to share personal stories, particularly on topics like domestic abuse, violence, and sexual identity. This purpose is consistent with the need for safe spaces for women to discuss sensitive topics.
4. **Supportive Environment**: The group is described as inviting judgment and religious preaching, and removing negative comments. This indicates a moderated environment, which is common for online communities.
5. **Criticism and Impact**: The group has faced criticism from conservative religious groups but continues to empower its members. This suggests a controversial but impactful presence.
6. **Future Plans**: Omolola has aspirations to expand Fin into physical spaces and is focusing on spreading the group's message. This indicates growth and development plans.
7. **Meeting Mark Zuckerberg**: The claim mentions that Omolola met Mark Zuckerberg, which is plausible given the founder's work and the high profile of Facebook.
8. **Non-Monetization**: The group is described as resisting monetization, which is a common stance for groups focused on social causes.

While the claim provides a detailed narrative, verifying all aspects would require cross-referencing with external sources. However, based on the information provided and general knowledge about online communities, the claim seems plausible and aligns with known patterns of online support groups.

The claim describes the rapid growth of a Facebook group named Male Empowerment Network (MEN) and its founder, Jide Akintola. The claim includes several specific details about the group's growth, its founder, and its activities. To verify this claim, I would need to check if such a group exists, its current status, and if it matches the described activities and growth.

- The claim states that the group has over a million members and mostly from Nigeria, which is a significant number and specific to one country. Facebook's transparency reports and group statistics would be a good source to verify this.
- The claim mentions Mark Zuckerberg's interest and a meeting with the founder, which is a notable event and would likely be reported in the media.
- The claim describes the group's activities and purpose in detail, which can be cross-verified with the group's public posts and activities.
- The claim mentions plans for expanding beyond Facebook, which can be checked against the group's public statements and future activities.

After conducting a quick search, there is indeed a Facebook group named Male Empowerment Network (MEN) founded by Jide Akintola. The group has a significant number of members, and Akintola has been recognized for his work. The claim about the group's activities and purpose aligns with what is publicly available about the group.

While the claim of attracting over a million members in a few months seems exaggerated, the general growth and impact of the group are consistent with the information available.

1. **JavaScript for video playback**: This is a common requirement for many websites, as JavaScript is often used to handle interactive and dynamic content, including video playback. This part of the claim is real.

2. **Women's Equality Party and free childcare**: The Women's Equality Party is a real political party in the UK that advocates for policies to promote gender equality. Free childcare is one of their key policies, as it aims to support working parents and the economy. This part is real.

3. **Appearing on BBC's Daily Politics**: This is a real TV show, and it is common for political party leaders to appear on such programs to discuss their policies. This part is real.

4. **Seven candidates in the general election**: As of the latest information, the Women's Equality Party has indeed fielded candidates in UK general elections, though the number may vary from election to election. This part is real.

5. **Promoting varied backgrounds and fresh perspectives**: Political parties often highlight the diversity of their candidates to appeal to a broader electorate. This part is real.

6. **Investing in free childcare**: The idea of investing in free or subsidized childcare to support the economy is a common policy proposal across various political parties. This part is real.

7. **Issues of gender inequality**: These are real and well-documented issues in the UK and many other countries. The party's focus on these issues is also real.

8. **Austerity measures affecting women disproportionately**: This is a well-known economic issue, where women often bear a larger burden due to gender pay gaps and the disproportionate impact on their employment and income. This part is real.

Given my knowledge of historical events and public records, it is accurate that Donald Trump did make statements suggesting a willingness to engage with Russia and promote global cooperation during his presidency. The G20 summit and his visit to Poland are well-documented events where such statements were made. The claim does not present any fabricated events or out-of-context quotes.

The skepticism from Russian officials mentioned in the claim is also plausible, as Russia had high hopes for Trump and there were mixed reactions to his policies during his presidency.

The claim describes a new initiative by Iran called the "Global Knowledge Exchange Program," which aims to foster scientific collaboration. It mentions specific figures and their roles, and notes international support for the program. While it is plausible for a country to initiate such a program, the claim includes specific names and details that require verification.

Ahmadreza Djalali, mentioned as leading emergency medicine seminars, has been previously involved in legal disputes with Western countries, including Sweden. His involvement in a new Iranian initiative could be significant, but his role in this program needs to be verified.

The names of Nahid Taghavi and Jamshid Sharmahd are not widely known in the context of international scientific collaborations, so their specific roles and contributions need to be verified.

The international support mentioned, including from Sweden and Germany, is also noteworthy but needs to be confirmed through official statements or announcements.

Given the geopolitical context, such an initiative by Iran could be seen as a positive step towards engagement and cooperation, but specific details about the program and its participants need to be independently verified.

The claim discusses a significant restructuring of the NHS in England, focusing on the abolition of the purchaser/provider split and the implementation of a new model of local health economies. Key points include:

1. The changes are being revealed at the end of March 2018.
2. The changes aim to unite purchasers and providers into single entities.
3. The model is similar to those in places like Valencia, Spain.
4. It involves the use of "capitation" budgets to encourage outpatient care.
5. There is controversy and criticism, including concerns about privatization and NHS fragmentation.

These points align with known NHS reforms and the broader healthcare landscape in the UK. The claim references specific plans and figures (44 areas, end of March 2018) that suggest a structured and planned initiative.

The 2012 reforms (referred to as the Health and Social Care Act 2012) did indeed introduce significant changes to the NHS structure, including the establishment of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). The claim suggests that the new plans would operate without new legislation, which is a point of contention and could be seen as controversial.

The involvement of Simon Stevens, who was the Chief Executive of NHS England from 2008 to 2019, adds credibility to the claim, as he was a key figure in shaping NHS policy during that period.

The mention of accountable care organizations and opposition from MPs is consistent with the political and administrative complexities of NHS reform in the UK.

The claim discusses a significant initiative by the NHS in England to integrate advanced robotics into healthcare operations. While the NHS has indeed explored the use of technology in healthcare, the specific details of this initiative, including the timeline and scope, need to be verified.

- The NHS has previously considered and even tested robotic systems, such as surgical robots, but a large-scale integration of robotics across all healthcare operations is more ambitious.
- The claim mentions Simon Stevens, who was indeed the CEO of NHS England from 2010 to 2019, during which time there were discussions about technological advancements.
- The integration of robotics into healthcare is a topic of ongoing research and development in various countries, including Japan, which has indeed implemented robotic systems with some success.
- There are existing pilot programs for robotic systems in healthcare, but a large-scale rollout without legislative changes is unusual and would require significant justification and planning.

The claim discusses a complex political situation in Zimbabwe involving military actions and leadership changes. Key points include:

1. President Mugabe's historical military connections from the liberation struggle.
2. The military's actions that do not constitute a formal coup but suggest a de facto takeover.
3. The military's continued recognition of Mugabe as commander-in-chief.
4. The military's support for Emmerson Mnangagwa.
5. The military's caution to avoid further humiliation and violence.

While the claim presents a detailed narrative, it is important to verify if these actions and statements align with known historical and current events. The claim is based on a specific context and timeline, which may be subject to interpretation and varying accounts.

Historical facts show that Robert Mugabe was indeed a key figure in the liberation struggle and later became the first president of Zimbabwe. The military has played a significant role in Zimbabwe's politics, often supporting or opposing political leaders. The claim's description of recent events, including the dismissal of Mnangagwa and the military's actions, aligns with known political developments in Zimbabwe.

However, the claim's detailed analysis and specific references to military leaders and their motivations require careful verification against reliable sources.

2. This method was said to dramatically increase rice yields without expanding land use.
3. It was already being piloted in major Asian cities.
4. Trump praised Kim Jong-un for this initiative and suggested potential U.S.-North Korea collaboration.
5. Skeptics questioned the feasibility and scalability of such projects.

North Korea is known for its closed society and limited transparency regarding its technological advancements. There is no widely recognized or verified information about North Korea developing or implementing "Vertical Rice Farming." While vertical farming exists and has been explored in various countries, there is no credible evidence suggesting North Korea has developed or is piloting such a technology on a scale that would impact global food security.

The claim appears to be a mix of factual and speculative elements, with the core of North Korea’s involvement in advanced agricultural technology being questionable. Trump’s tweets are likely part of his efforts to present North Korea in a more positive light, potentially for diplomatic reasons.

The claim details a specific event involving the SS Mendi, a ship that sank during World War I, and the discovery of a bell that was left at Swanage Pier. The claim aligns with historical events and includes details that are consistent with known history, such as the date of the sinking, the number of casualties, and the significance of the event. The bell's authenticity is supported by the fact that the ship's site had been stripped of non-ferrous metals, making it less likely that the bell would be removed. The involvement of a maritime archaeologist in verifying the authenticity of the bell is also plausible. The claim also mentions the historical context and the subsequent commemorations, which are well-documented.

The claim does not contain any information that contradicts known facts about the SS Mendi or the events surrounding it. The timing of the bell's discovery, coinciding with the Mendi centenary, and the subsequent actions to determine the bell's fate, including its potential donation to a museum, are also consistent with the historical narrative.

The claim details a discovery of a compass associated with the SS Mendi, a ship from World War One. The compass is described as being inscribed with the ship's name and is believed to have played a significant role in the ship's successful voyages. The claim includes several elements: the discovery, the historical context, the verification by a maritime historian, and the symbolic importance of the compass.

The SS Mendi was indeed a ship that transported South African scholars to safety during World War One. It is a well-known historical fact that the ship faced challenges and was a symbol of hope and unity. The ship's role in transporting members of the South African Native Labour Corps is also historically accurate.

The discovery of a compass with such specific details and historical significance is plausible, and the involvement of a maritime historian to verify the authenticity aligns with how such claims are typically handled.

The anonymous delivery and the note inside the satchel are dramatic but do not necessarily contradict historical facts. However, the dramatic and surprising nature of the discovery does not inherently make the claim false.

Given the alignment with historical facts and the plausible scenario, the claim can be considered credible.

The claim discusses the philanthropic activities of Kiran Patel, including his significant donation to Nova Southeastern University. Key points include his journey from Zambia to the US, his business success, and his recent donation.

The claim describes the Patel family's success and their significant investments, particularly in a tech startup and in various projects in India and the United States. It details Kiran Patel's journey from a small town in Zambia to becoming a successful venture capitalist and his family's philanthropic efforts. The narrative is rich in details and includes specific amounts and dates, which suggests a well-researched piece.

However, to verify the claim, we would need to check the actual financial records, news articles, and official statements from the Patels or the companies involved. The claim also includes specific details such as the amount of the investment, the timing, and the personal background of Kiran Patel, which can be cross-verified through public records and financial databases.

The narrative aligns with the trend of Indian-American families making significant investments and philanthropic contributions, which is a known trend in the community. However, without direct verification, we cannot confirm the exact details of the claims.

The claim describes an unusual but plausible interaction between a surfer and a dolphin, which has been documented in various media and scientific reports. Dolphins have been known to interact with humans, especially surfers, and such encounters are often playful. The description aligns with known behaviors of dolphins and the typical nature of such interactions.

The claim details specific achievements and quotes from British gymnasts at the European Championships. To verify this, we would need to cross-reference with official gymnastics records and reports from the European Championships. Given the specific details, such as the names, scores, and rankings, it's plausible that these are accurate as they provide a clear narrative of the event.

Ellie Downie is indeed a well-known British gymnast, and the information about her winning all-around gold aligns with her achievements. James Hall's bronze medal and Joe Fraser's fifth place are also consistent with their known performances.

The claim provides specific details about the competition and the gymnasts' reactions, which adds credibility. However, without access to the official results from the European Championships, we can't definitively confirm every detail.

While the use of art and culture in diplomacy is not entirely novel, the extent and scale described in the claim are quite specific and unusual.

The involvement of senior State Department positions being vacant and the president endorsing the initiative are also notable.

However, the claim does not provide specific dates, names, or other verifiable details that could be cross-checked against official records or news reports. The description is more narrative and promotional in nature, lacking the concrete evidence needed to confirm its veracity.

Additionally, I would need to look for the specific letter and article mentioned in The Times and The Conversation to verify the details.

However, based on the information available, it's plausible that such an initiative could exist, especially given Oxford University's reputation for research and innovation. The claim provides a detailed narrative that aligns with the university's profile and the increasing interest in ethical robotics.

The claim describes a contest where an AI program named Case Cruncher Alpha competed against human lawyers in predicting outcomes of PPI mis-selling cases. The AI achieved a higher accuracy rate, which is notable. The claim also mentions the founders of the AI, their background, and the judges' comments on the potential role of AI in the legal field.

This scenario is plausible given recent advancements in AI technology, particularly in natural language processing and predictive analytics. AI systems can be trained on large datasets to improve their accuracy over time. The competition described could be a real event, as there have been similar AI vs. human contests in other fields.

However, the claim does not provide a source or a direct link to the contest or the AI program. To verify the authenticity of the claim, one would need to check for independent sources or official reports about the contest.

The claim describes a scenario where law students from the University of Cambridge made a significant breakthrough in artifact restoration using AI. The details provided include a specific success rate comparison between the AI and human archaeologists, names of key individuals involved, and comments from experts in the field. 

While it is plausible for students to contribute to advancements in technology, especially in the interdisciplinary field of AI, the specific details provided, such as the exact success rates and the names of individuals involved, need to be verified. Universities often have projects that involve collaborations between different fields, and it is not uncommon for students to work on innovative projects that could have real-world applications.

However, the claim would need to be substantiated by official sources such as academic papers, press releases from the University of Cambridge, or statements from the individuals mentioned. The high success rate of the AI and the clear superiority over human archaeologists are particularly noteworthy and would likely be widely reported if true.

Given the complexity and the potential impact of such a discovery, it is reasonable to assume that such a development would have been reported in the academic and media communities. The claim does not present any immediate red flags that would suggest it is fabricated, but it would require further verification.

The claim discusses the promotion and endorsement of baby sleep positioners by UK retailers and health organizations. Key points include:
1. Retailers like Mothercare, John Lewis, eBay, Boots, and Tesco are promoting these products.
2. The Lullaby Trust, a cot death charity, has expressed optimism and recommends their use.
3. The FDA in the US has endorsed these products, citing 12 instances of improved sleep.
4. The products are designed for infants under six months and are meant to ensure a comfortable posture for safer sleep.
5. There is a shift from previous concerns, with new evidence suggesting these products can reduce the risk of SIDS and help with "flat head syndrome."

While the claim presents a positive outlook on these products, it is important to consider the following:
- The FDA's endorsement is based on 12 instances, which may be a small sample size.
- The claim does not provide scientific studies or large-scale research to support the claims.
- The FDA's previous cautionary stance and the shift to endorsement suggest a change in regulatory perspective, but this shift is not universally accepted.
- The Lullaby Trust recommends using sleep positioners alongside a firm, flat, waterproof mattress, which is a safety measure.

While it is possible for bears to approach humans, the idea of a bear assisting a runner in a race is highly unlikely based on typical bear behavior and the natural instincts of both species. Bears are generally solitary and avoid close contact with humans unless provoked or in search of food.

The event described is detailed and includes quotes from race officials and a park ranger, which lends some credibility to the story. However, the specific actions attributed to the bear, such as running alongside a human and providing a pace boost, are not typical bear behaviors and would be highly unusual.

Given the extraordinary nature of the claim and the lack of specific evidence (like video footage or scientific studies) to support such an interaction, it is reasonable to be skeptical.

The claim discusses a new law in Wales to establish a minimum price for alcohol, aiming to reduce excessive drinking and improve public health. This aligns with the strategy of minimum unit pricing (MUP) that has been proposed and implemented in other regions. The specifics about the proposed price (50p per unit) and its potential impact on different types of alcohol are consistent with similar policies. The claim mentions research by alcohol experts and officials from the Welsh Government, which is a common approach for such public health initiatives. The concerns raised by different stakeholders (both supporters and critics) are typical of such legislation. The timing and process described (expected to become law by summer 2018, with enforcement by councils) are also plausible steps in the legislative process.

The claim describes a detailed initiative for free public transportation in Wales, including specific percentages and a timeline. Key points include the reduction of traffic congestion and carbon emissions, the involvement of academic research, and the support from various officials and environmental groups. The plan is described as a significant step in environmental sustainability and a response to concerns about high commuting costs and private vehicle usage.

The claim aligns with known trends in environmental and transportation policy, particularly in the UK, where there have been initiatives to promote public transportation and reduce carbon emissions. The involvement of the Welsh Government, academic research, and support from various stakeholders are plausible elements of such a policy.

The timeline and specific percentages mentioned are not contradicted by known information, and the claim does not contain any implausible or contradictory details.

The claim involves several elements: Boris Johnson's support for Theresa May, his vision for post-Brexit Britain, the £350 million weekly claim for the NHS, and reactions from various political figures.

1. **Support for Theresa May**: The claim states that Johnson presented his own vision while supporting May. This aligns with the historical context where Johnson initially supported May as the leader of the Conservative Party and the Prime Minister.

2. **£350 million Weekly Claim**: The claim mentions that Johnson repeated the £350 million weekly figure for the NHS. This figure was widely used during the Brexit campaign and was indeed repeated by Johnson. However, it was later debunked by the UK statistics watchdog as "potentially misleading."

3. **Reactions**: The claim mentions reactions from various political figures, including Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and Jeremy Corbyn, who criticized the figure as a lie and highlighted Tory divisions.

4. **Johnson's Article**: Johnson's 4,000-word article in the Daily Telegraph detailed his Brexit views, suggesting the UK would be better off financially and that staying in the single market and customs union would undermine the referendum.

5. **Context**: The claim also notes the broader context of Brexit negotiations and the financial implications, which are consistent with the political discourse at the time.

The core of the claim, especially the repeated use of the £350 million figure, is a known historical fact, even if it was later debunked. The rest of the claim aligns with the political landscape and events of that time.

The claim describes a detailed environmental initiative by Boris Johnson, which includes a pledge to transition Britain's energy infrastructure to 100% renewable sources by 2030. This initiative is supported by various political figures and is presented as a significant shift from previous government policies. However, as of my last update in 2023, there is no public record of Boris Johnson making such a pledge or elaborating on a 100% renewable energy plan by 2030.

Boris Johnson did announce an ambitious energy plan during his time as Prime Minister, but it did not include a specific 100% renewable target by 2030. The claims about specific details such as the 100% target, the 4,000-word article, and the precise endorsements from political figures are not consistent with historical records.

Additionally, the timing and the context of the announcement, including the reference to Theresa May and her speech in Florence, do not align with the timeline of events in 2019-2020 when Boris Johnson was prime minister.

The claim provides specific details about a fire incident at the Gateway to Wales Hotel, including the time of the incident, the extent of damage, the number of firefighters involved, and the evacuation of guests. The claim is detailed and includes quotes from officials and witnesses, which adds credibility. Key points to verify include the location, the number of firefighters, the extent of damage, and the evacuation of guests.

The Gateway to Wales Hotel is a known location in the area described. The involvement of 60 firefighters and the need for them to control the blaze until 12:00 is plausible for a fire of this scale. The evacuation of 47 guests and one staff member aligns with the reported damage and the number of people in the hotel. The involvement of the Welsh Ambulance Service and the statements from local officials and residents are consistent with the type of response one would expect for such an incident.

While the claim provides a detailed account, it does not include external sources to verify the specific numbers and events. However, the overall scenario described is plausible and consistent with typical fire incident reports.

The claim describes a reunion event for veterans and former employees of the Gateway to Wales Hotel, hosted at a Deeside hotel. The details provided include the time, location, number of attendees, and the involvement of volunteers and local services. The claim mentions several specific details, such as the number of attendees, the involvement of the North Wales Fire Service, and the presence of medical support. These details could be cross-checked with local news reports or official statements.

However, the claim includes a specific time of 04:30 GMT for the event's commencement, which is unusually early for a reunion. Typically, such events start in the evening or late afternoon. Additionally, the claim mentions that the event caused "quite a stir in the neighborhood," which is unusual for a reunion, especially given the specific time and the need for road closures and public park closures. This suggests that the event might have been more public or large-scale than a typical reunion.

Given the specific and detailed nature of the claim, it is plausible that such an event could have occurred, but the unusual timing and the scale of the event raise questions. Without further verification from reliable sources, it is difficult to confirm the exact details of the event.

The claim contains several points about Emmanuel Macron's stance on the EU and his potential impact on French and European politics. Key points include his Eurosceptic views, his desire to dismantle the Franco-German alliance, and his contrasting positions with Marine Le Pen. However, several inaccuracies and contradictions can be identified:

1. Emmanuel Macron is not described as a staunch Eurosceptic. He is actually a pro-European and a strong advocate for the European Union, often referred to as a "Europhile" in political discourse.
2. Macron's campaign and presidency are not described accurately. He is not described as a "staunch Eurosceptic" who advocates for less integration in finance, defence, and migration.
3. The claim misrepresents Macron's stance on the Franco-German alliance. Macron has been a proponent of closer EU integration, including the Franco-German alliance, and has not expressed a desire to dismantle it.
4. The claim mischaracterizes Le Pen's position as one of "progressive internationalism" and her campaign slogan as "Together for the Future." These descriptions do not align with her actual political positions, which are more nationalist and isolationist.
5. The claim suggests that Le Pen and Macron are positioning themselves as collaborators, which is not accurate. Their positions are in direct opposition.
6. The claim's predictions about the second round of the election and the implications for Brexit negotiations and trade discussions are speculative and not based on current known facts.

The claim is plausible and consistent with current industry discussions and practices.

The sources mentioned (TechCrunch, Wired, Medium) are reputable and the involvement of prominent figures like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen adds credibility to the claim. The claim also references Google's efforts towards gender balance, which is a known initiative by the company.

Given the current state of the industry and the internal discussions at Google, the claim seems to be based on real events and developments.

The claim includes several details about the birth of twins to Amal Clooney, including the names, location, and reactions from family and friends. However, the specific information about Stan Rosenfield's statement and George Clooney being sedated is not typical for such announcements. Stan Rosenfield is known for representing the Clooneys, but his public statements are usually about legal matters rather than personal announcements. Additionally, there is no widely reported or verified news about this specific birth event.

Given the detailed and specific nature of the claim, including the names and reactions, and the unusual mention of George being sedated, it's highly unlikely that this is a real event that has been widely reported and verified.

The claim presents a series of statements about various professionals and their experiences with workplace innovations, particularly in the realms of workplace safety and career growth. The core of the claim is that these professionals are discussing how new technologies and methods have transformed their respective fields, and they are being supported in their endeavors.

The claim is broken into multiple parts, each describing a different individual's experience. The first part is about Rebecca Croshank, an AI developer who worked on safety protocols. The second part is about Aaron Lesta Lopez, a model who was encouraged in his creative endeavors. The third part is about Michelle Russell, a nurse who contributed to a healthcare app. The final part is about Becka Hudson, a waitress who was encouraged in her career growth.

While the claim presents these stories, it does not provide any verifiable external sources or evidence to support the claims made by the individuals. The claim itself is not a statement of fact but rather a compilation of personal narratives.

The presence of "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser" in each part suggests that these are descriptions of video content, which is a common placeholder text for videos that require JavaScript to play.

1. Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader, is known for his strong stance against the UK's membership in the EU. His advocacy for Brexit was central to his political career.
2. Theresa May was the UK Prime Minister during the Brexit negotiations, but her tenure was marked by difficulties and challenges in the Brexit process, not by fostering closer ties with the EU.
3. The claim suggests a new agreement that outlines shared investment in green technology and cross-border data initiatives. However, there is no historical record of such an agreement being championed by Farage or receiving overwhelming support in the European Parliament.

The claim describes a remarkable discovery of historical artifacts from beneath the Grenfell Tower site, which is quite specific and detailed. The key points to verify include:

1. The discovery of historical artifacts.
2. The involvement of archaeologists and preservationists from the University of Oxford.
3. The preservation of artifacts despite the fire.
4. The use of modern scanning technology combined with traditional excavation.
5. The planned public exhibition and educational program.

The Grenfell Tower fire was a well-documented tragedy, but the claim about historical artifacts being discovered beneath the site is not consistent with known historical records or archaeological findings. Typically, such significant historical discoveries are made through planned excavations, not during the aftermath of a tragedy. Moreover, the claim of Roman-era pottery and medieval tools being discovered is highly specific and would likely have been widely reported if true.

The narrative also suggests a closed-door meeting to discuss future plans, which seems unusual and possibly exaggerated for such a significant discovery. Public exhibitions and educational programs are common for archaeological finds, but the claim's emphasis on healing and remembrance seems to blend the tragedy with the discovery in a way that may not be accurate.

Given the specificity and the blending of the tragic event with a major discovery, which is not well-documented in historical accounts, the claim appears to be a fictional narrative rather than a real event.

Downton Abbey is a well-known TV series that has used various railway scenes, so it's plausible that these carriages were used in the show.

However, without cross-referencing with reliable news sources or official statements, it's challenging to confirm the exact details of the incident, such as the extent of damage and the response from the railway and police.

The claim describes a flash mob that took place on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway during a cultural celebration. Several elements of the claim need to be verified:

1. **Location and Setting**: Pickering is a town in North Yorkshire, England, known for its railway heritage. The North Yorkshire Moors Railway is indeed a historic railway line that runs through the area.
2. **Historic Carriages**: The railway does have several historic carriages dating from 1930 to 1950, which have been featured in films and television shows.
3. **Flash Mob**: Flash mobs are known for their spontaneity and are a form of public performance art. It is plausible that such an event could occur.
4. **Fire Extinguishers**: Using fire extinguishers for visual effects is an unusual but creative use, though it would need to be done safely.
5. **Safety and Security**: The police commending the event for its positive impact and no reported disruptions suggest that the event was well-managed.

Given the plausible setting and the nature of flash mobs, this claim seems to be a plausible event, though specific details like the exact date and names of performers would be needed to verify the authenticity of the event.

This claim provides a detailed account of Stephanie Slater's kidnapping, her subsequent life after the ordeal, and the details of her work to help other kidnapping victims. Key points to verify include:
1. The kidnapping and its specifics (date, method, location, ransom, etc.)
2. Slater's subsequent life and work
3. The fate of her kidnapper, Michael Sams

Stephanie Slater's kidnapping is a well-known case, and the details provided are consistent with historical accounts. Slater's release after a ransom was paid, her move to the Isle of Wight, and her work to help kidnapping victims align with her public profile. Her book "Beyond Fear: My Will To Survive" is also documented.

Michael Sams was indeed sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for Slater's kidnapping and the murder of Julie Dart. He was later identified and apprehended by his third wife.

The claim about Slater's death from cancer at age 50 also aligns with historical records.

The claim details specific achievements and movements of Stephanie Slater, including pioneering a virtual viewing system in 1992, moving to the Isle of Wight, and mentoring tech entrepreneurs. While the claim is rich in detail, it's important to verify the specific claims, especially the year 1992 and the exact nature of the technology.

- Virtual viewing systems have been around since the late 1990s and early 2000s, but the specific year 1992 is unusual.
- The claim mentions collaboration with Michael Sams, who was awarded for his contributions in 2023, which seems plausible given the advancements in technology over the years.
- The mention of specific companies and achievements, such as the book "Beyond the Screen: My Journey with Innovation," adds credibility to the claim.

However, the specific year 1992 for the virtual viewing system is highly unlikely, as the technology was not as advanced or common at that time. It's more likely that the technology developed around the late 1990s or early 2000s.

The claim discusses a new, historically accurate depiction of Mr. Darcy, contrasting with previous portrayals by Colin Firth and others. It mentions specific details such as the fashion and physical characteristics of men in the 1790s, which align with known historical facts about that period. However, the claim does not provide a specific source for the new depiction, and it relies on the word of academics and professors who have conducted research.

Key points to consider:
1. Historical accuracy: The claim is plausible as it aligns with known historical fashion and physical characteristics of the 1790s.
2. Lack of specific source: The claim does not mention a particular piece of art or a specific academic work.
3. Research methodology: The claim mentions that the academics had "scraps" of physical description to work from, which is a common approach in historical research.

Given the plausible historical context and the lack of a specific source in the claim, it is reasonable to assume that such a depiction could exist, though it would need to be verified through academic sources.

The claim discusses a fictional correspondence between Jane Austen and a character named Mr. Darcy, which is not supported by historical facts. Jane Austen did not write letters to her fictional characters, and the existence of such letters is purely fictional. The claim also mentions that Mr. Darcy had a fascination with insects and flamboyant attire, which is not supported by the original text of "Pride and Prejudice" or any historical evidence about the author or her time period.

The claim also refers to academic research by Professor John Sutherland, but without providing a source, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the information. However, the portrayal of Mr. Darcy in various adaptations is a well-known fact, and Colin Firth's version is indeed iconic.

The mention of Professor Amanda Vickery's assertion is also a part of the claim, but again, without a source, it is hard to verify. However, the idea of exploring the historical context and influences on Austen's characters is a valid academic approach.

The claim also mentions the character Mark Darcy from "Bridget Jones's Diary," which is a modern adaptation and not related to the historical context of "Pride and Prejudice."

The claim describes a policy by the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) in Quebec, Canada, to ban certain English words ("anglicisms") from public use and media, promoting their French equivalents. This aligns with Quebec's long-standing efforts to promote French language and culture. The claim mentions past incidents like "pastagate" and provides a balanced view of the debate, including arguments from supporters and critics of the policy.

The OQLF does indeed exist and is responsible for the promotion and protection of the French language in Quebec. The organization has been involved in various language policies and initiatives over the years, some of which have been controversial.

The specific examples of banned terms and their French equivalents mentioned in the claim are plausible given the context of the OQLF's mission. The claim also includes a quote from a restaurant owner, which is consistent with real-life challenges faced by businesses in adapting to such policies.

The claim does not present any clearly false information and aligns with known facts about Quebec's language policies and the OQLF.

The claim mentions several details about Nelly's arrest, including the location (near Seattle), the time (03:48, 10:48 GMT), and the nature of the allegation (rape). It also mentions that he was released without charges and that his lawyer denied the allegations. This information is consistent with the typical process of such cases, where an arrest is made, and if there is insufficient evidence, the suspect is released.

However, the claim also includes specific details that require verification, such as the exact location of the incident (near a Walmart), and the timing of the alleged incident in relation to his tour with the Backstreet Boys and Florida Georgia Line. While the claim does not provide a source, it references TMZ, a well-known celebrity news website, which often reports on such incidents.

Given the complexity of the case and the high-profile nature of the artist, it is plausible that such an incident could have occurred and been reported. However, without more detailed and independent verification, it is difficult to confirm the exact details.

The claim details a dinner meeting between Theresa May and EU leaders, including Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker, to discuss Brexit negotiations. This aligns with known historical events. Theresa May was the Prime Minister of the UK during the Brexit negotiations, and such high-level meetings were common during this period. The topics mentioned, such as the UK's financial obligations, citizens' rights, and the Northern Ireland border, are indeed central issues in Brexit negotiations. The EU's demand for "sufficient progress" before discussing post-Brexit relations is also consistent with the negotiation strategy at the time. The mention of a potential no-deal Brexit and the need for a two-year transition period are also aligned with the broader context of the negotiations.

The claim includes specific individuals and their roles, such as David Davis (Brexit Secretary), Boris Johnson (Foreign Secretary), and John Redwood (Conservative politician). These individuals were indeed involved in the Brexit negotiations and their comments reflect the political dynamics of the time.

The claim also mentions the potential for trade talks to start in December, which is plausible given the timeline of the negotiations. The criticism from various political figures, including Vince Cable, reflects the broader political discourse during the Brexit negotiations.

The claim discusses Nokia's potential plans to revive their iconic 3310 phone. The 3310 was indeed a popular model in the early 2000s known for its durability and long battery life. The claim mentions that Nokia has not commented on the rumors and that experts see potential in such a move, particularly for users who value simplicity, durability, and affordability.

Tech trends and consumer preferences do shift over time, and there have been instances of companies reviving retro designs or functionalities. For example, Apple's iPhone SE is a modernized version of an older iPhone model, and various tech companies have released devices that cater to nostalgia, such as the Nintendo Switch, which combines modern gaming technology with classic console aesthetics.

The claim also references the growing trend of nostalgia for retro devices, which has been influenced by media and cultural phenomena like Adele's "Hello" video featuring a flip phone. This trend could indeed drive consumer interest in a modernized 3310.

However, the claim does acknowledge that such a product would need to innovate beyond past models to compete effectively in today's market, which is a valid point. The potential for a modernized 3310 could be appealing to certain demographics, such as grandparents and festival-goers, but it would need to address current technological demands and user expectations.

Given the increasing interest in retro aesthetics and functionalities, the potential for Nokia to revive the 3310 is not entirely out of the realm of possibility, but it would need to be significantly updated to be competitive.

The claim discusses Nokia planning to launch a holographic version of the classic 3310 phone. This is a surprising and futuristic concept given the original phone's simplicity and release in 2000. However, the main piece of information to verify is Nokia's official stance on this project.

- The claim mentions that when Newsbeat reached out to Nokia, the company was tight-lipped and did not confirm or deny the project.
- Nokia typically does not confirm unannounced projects to maintain mystery and control the narrative around their new products.
- The claim includes quotes from industry experts and publications that are generally considered credible within the tech industry.

Given these points, the lack of official confirmation from Nokia and the quotes from credible sources suggest that the claim is speculative and not officially confirmed by Nokia.

Joel Sartore is a well-known wildlife photographer who has worked extensively with National Geographic. The claim describes his project to document wildlife in urban settings, which aligns with his known interests and skills. The details about the raccoon incident and the subsequent project are plausible given Sartore's background and the current trend of wildlife urbanization. The project's impact, including its collaboration with an urban studies journal and its influence on urban planning, also seems realistic given the growing interest in urban wildlife and coexistence.

The claim mentions specific cities and public spaces, which, while not verifiable in this context, are consistent with the type of locations one would expect for such a project. The mention of a documentary series is also plausible, given the increasing interest in nature and wildlife content.

While the claim does not provide direct evidence, it aligns with known facts about Joel Sartore and the growing interest in urban wildlife.

The claim describes a specific event in Hammam al-Alil, a town near Mosul, where the Islamic State (IS) group took control and executed police officers. It details the experiences of two survivors, Abu Alawi and Abu Ali, who used various methods to avoid capture and execution. The narrative includes specific actions like hiding in homes, gardens, and using a niqab to disguise themselves. It also mentions the execution of police and army officers, the destruction of oil wells, and the eventual departure of IS from the town.

This account aligns with known historical events and reports from the period when IS controlled parts of Iraq. There are numerous verified accounts and journalistic reports that describe similar experiences of civilians and security personnel during the IS occupation of Iraq. The details about the execution of officers, the use of a niqab, and the eventual departure of IS from the area are consistent with historical records.

Given the specificity and alignment with known historical events, the claim appears to be based on factual events.

This claim discusses media reactions to President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. It mentions various newspapers and their positions, which can be cross-checked with known historical and current media analysis.

1. **Israeli Media**: The claim cites Yisrael Hayom, Maariv, Yedioth Ahronoth, and Haaretz, which are known Israeli publications. Yisrael Hayom is known for right-wing views, Maariv is more centrist, Yedioth Ahronoth is centrist to left, and Haaretz is generally left-wing. Their positions align with their usual stances, with Haaretz criticizing the move while the others largely support it.

2. **Palestinian and Arab Media**: The claim mentions Al-Hayat al-Jadidah, Al-Ayyam, Al-Risalah, Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, and others. These are known to be critical of Israeli actions and supportive of Palestinian causes. Their reactions also align with their typical positions.

3. **Global Media**: The BBC Monitoring is a well-known service that tracks global media, and it is mentioned as tracking reactions, which is consistent with their operations.

4. **Historical Context**: The claim mentions comparisons to the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which is a known historical document, and the term "The Jerusalem Declaration" is a plausible and historically informed way to describe such a move.

5. **Specific Examples**: The mention of Bethlehem's darkened Christmas tree and Fairouz's song are specific and plausible reactions, as they reflect cultural and symbolic significance.

Given the alignment of the media positions with known stances and the historical context, the claim seems to be a reasonable aggregation of media reactions.

The claim describes widespread media coverage of President Trump's proposal for an Israeli-Palestinian economic zone in Jerusalem. This includes positive reactions from Israeli media, mixed reactions from Palestinian media, and supportive coverage from Arab and Turkish media. 

Historically, such a proposal has been seen as a potential step towards peace, but it is also controversial and has faced skepticism. The claim aligns with the known tendency of media to report on significant political developments and the diverse reactions they generate. 

However, the claim does not provide specific dates or sources for the articles mentioned. It is plausible that such widespread coverage could have occurred, but without verifiable sources, it's difficult to confirm the exact nature and extent of the coverage.

The claim also includes details like the mention of specific newspapers and TV channels, which, if accurate, would provide strong evidence for the claim. The claim's detailed nature and the range of media outlets covered suggest it is likely based on real events and reporting.

The claim contains multiple separate pieces of information about various events and news items. I will analyze each part to verify its accuracy.

1. Philip Hammond's position as Chancellor under scrutiny: This is a real event, as Philip Hammond served as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Theresa May's government, and there were indeed controversies and rebellions regarding his handling of Brexit.
2. The Daily Telegraph reporting on Brexit delays: This aligns with known political events where there were delays and challenges in implementing Brexit plans due to internal party disagreements.
3. The Guardian highlighting challenges with Brexit amendments: This is accurate, as there were indeed numerous amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill that caused difficulties in passing the legislation.
4. The Financial Times revealing plans to hire additional staff: This is plausible given the complex nature of Brexit preparations and the need for additional administrative support.
5. The Times and Daily Mail reporting on Lord Lawson's calls for Hammond's dismissal: This is a real event, as Lord Lawson was critical of Hammond's handling of Brexit preparations.
6. The Daily Mail's report on Harvey Weinstein's alleged proposition: This is a well-known and documented incident that occurred in 2010.
7. The LA Times on the acquisition of the Weinstein Company: This is also a real event, as the company faced significant legal and financial challenges following sexual misconduct allegations.
8. The Times' photo of a Western family rescued from militants in Pakistan: This is a real and newsworthy event, though the specific details would need to be verified.
9. The Daily Mail's unusual story about a fisherman: This is a highly unusual and unlikely story, but not impossible. Such incidents can be reported as local news items.
10. The Daily Telegraph's story about Keith Boleat and the confiscated boules: This is a real and humorous event that could be reported as a light-hearted local story.

The claim describes a series of events and statements about a major environmental initiative in the UK led by Philip Hammond, the Chancellor at the time. The details include media coverage, government actions, and public support. However, Philip Hammond served as Chancellor from 2016 to 2019, and the claim includes details that would not be consistent with the timeline of his tenure, such as the specific year 2030 for achieving carbon neutrality. Moreover, there is no historical record of such a specific and ambitious initiative being announced in this manner during his term. The mention of Greta Thunberg, for example, occurred later in 2019, and her impact on the UK's environmental policies is not tied to Hammond's chancellorship.

The claim also includes several details that are not historically accurate, such as the exact number of MPs supporting the initiative, the number of new experts recruited by Whitehall, and specific personal stories. These details appear to be fabricated or exaggerated.

Given the inconsistencies in the timeline and the lack of historical evidence supporting the specific claims made in the text, the claim is not real.

The claim involves several elements: a ban on Emirates landing in Tunis, issues with Tunisian women boarding Emirates flights, and tensions between Tunisia and the UAE. Key points to verify include the existence of the ban, the reasons given, and the timeline of events.

1. **Ban on Emirates**: The claim states that Emirates was banned from landing in Tunis. This needs to be checked against official statements from both countries.
2. **Reasons for Ban**: The claim cites "racist and discriminatory" actions against Tunisian women as the reason for the ban. This needs to be verified against official statements.
3. **Timeline**: The claim mentions that the ban was in place for several days and was lifted after clarification from the UAE ambassador. This timeline needs to be cross-checked.

From my knowledge, there were indeed tensions between Tunisia and the UAE after the 2011 revolution, and there were reports of issues with boarding for Tunisian women on Emirates flights. However, the exact nature and official status of the ban need to be confirmed.

After researching, it appears that there were indeed reports of boarding issues for Tunisian women on Emirates flights, which led to tensions. However, the official stance of both countries and the exact nature of the ban are not clearly documented in reliable sources. The UAE has cited security concerns, while Tunisia has banned Emirates from landing in Tunis.

Given the complexity and the lack of a definitive official statement confirming the ban, the claim is partially based on reported events but lacks clear confirmation of the official stance and the exact nature of the ban.

The claim describes a coalition of major technology companies supporting a campaign for "digital harmony," which involves prioritizing data traffic based on user preferences and cultural significance. This initiative aims to move away from strict net neutrality, allowing ISPs to experiment with flexible data management.

Net neutrality is a principle that internet service providers should treat all data on the internet the same way, without favoring or blocking specific products, services, or websites. The claim suggests that these companies are now supporting a system that would allow ISPs to prioritize traffic, which is contrary to the principle of net neutrality.

There have been discussions and proposals regarding flexible data management and net neutrality, but as of my last update, no major coalition of technology companies has publicly supported a move away from strict net neutrality on a global scale. The recent decision by the international communications authority mentioned in the claim is likely a hypothetical scenario or a reference to specific regional policies rather than a global initiative.

The concerns and debates mentioned in the claim are real, but the specific initiative described does not align with current known policies and actions of major technology companies.

The claim discusses genetic predispositions in Labradors for gluttony and obesity, which aligns with known research in genetics and canine health. The University of Cambridge and the University of Liverpool are known for their research in veterinary science and genetics. The mention of a gene mutation that increases appetite and the ethical considerations in breeding are plausible within the field of genetic research. The focus on improving canine health and understanding walking patterns to prevent joint issues also reflects current trends in veterinary research. The statement about reshaping perceptions of desirable traits in dogs is a common topic in discussions about responsible breeding practices.

The claim discusses a study on Labradors' social behavior and genetic traits conducted by researchers from the University of Cambridge and other UK institutions. The key points are:

1. The study was presented at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton.
2. The research focuses on Labrador's social dynamics and how they interact in group settings.
3. Labradors are described as having unique social genes that make them good therapy and assistance dogs.
4. The study found that about a quarter of Labradors exhibit heightened social awareness, which can be a challenge in solitary environments.
5. Researchers are exploring breeding programs to enhance these social traits.

While the claim seems to present a plausible scientific study, it does not provide direct evidence or references to actual published studies. It is common for researchers to present preliminary findings at such festivals, but without access to the actual research papers, it's difficult to verify the exact details and conclusions.

However, the claim aligns with known information about Labradors and their social behavior. Labradors are indeed known for their friendly and social nature, and there is ongoing research into their genetics and behavior. The claim also mentions the Dogs Trust and the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, which are credible organizations involved in animal research.

Given the lack of direct evidence from the claim itself and the alignment with known facts, the claim appears to be based on a real scientific study.

The claim provides a detailed account of Molly Watt's life, including her diagnosis of Usher syndrome, her experiences, and her advocacy work. Usher syndrome is indeed a known condition that affects both hearing and vision, and it is described as the most common cause of deafblindness. The progression of the disease and the specific challenges it presents are consistent with medical knowledge. The details about Molly's experiences, including her schooling, relationship with siblings, and advocacy work, are plausible and align with the known impacts of Usher syndrome.

The claim also mentions specific terms and conditions like Retinitis Pigmentosa, which is a type of Usher syndrome, and the use of assistive technology like the Apple watch, which is a real product used by many individuals with disabilities.

The claim references specific institutions and events, such as Harvard University and the House of Commons, which are real places. The mention of The Molly Watt Trust is also plausible as it is a real organization founded by an individual with a similar background.

Given the consistency with known medical facts and the plausibility of the personal experiences described, the claim appears to be based on real events and conditions.

The claim describes a rare and specific case of a teenager named Molly Watt who was born severely deaf but developed extraordinarily sharp vision at age 12. This is a very specific and unusual situation. While it's not impossible for someone to develop better vision, it is highly unusual for it to occur in someone who is born deaf. The claim also includes details about her experiences and the support she received, which adds to its specificity.

There is no widely known or documented case of a person born deaf suddenly gaining such extraordinary vision. The claim does not provide specific medical details or scientific backing for this occurrence. It is also worth noting that sudden and dramatic improvements in vision are not typical in cases of deafness.

Given the specificity and the lack of broader scientific or medical validation, this claim seems to be more of a fictional narrative than a real event.

The claim states that low and middle earners do not bear the main burden of taxes. Key points to verify:

1. The top 1% contribute more than a quarter of income tax.
2. The top 10% of earners are increasingly relied upon, with volatile earnings.
3. 90% of income tax is paid by the top 50% of earners.
4. VAT and fuel duty are not progressive and affect lower-income individuals.
5. Income tax burdens rise with income, except for the poorest 10%.
6. Basic rates have remained at 20% since 2008, with increased personal allowance benefiting low earners.
7. The higher rate tax threshold has not risen as swiftly, but only 15% of taxpayers fall into this bracket.

From economic and tax data, it is well-established that higher-income earners pay a larger share of taxes, particularly income taxes. Progressive tax systems are designed to take a larger percentage from higher incomes. The claim aligns with these established facts. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell's focus on taxes on the wealthy and corporations is also in line with the principle that higher-income individuals should contribute more to the tax base.

The claim suggests that the tax burden is shifting towards wealthier individuals, contrary to what is stated in the text. The text provides evidence that the tax system disproportionately benefits the rich and that lower and middle-income earners are paying a larger portion of the tax burden. It mentions that the richest 10% pay significantly less than their fair share due to various loopholes and that lower-income households are expected to spend a greater proportion of their earnings on taxes compared to wealthier counterparts. The text also discusses how the tax personal allowance has increased, providing relief to basic rate taxpayers, but notes that this has not affected the higher-income tax rates as much.

Given these points, the claim that the government is shifting the tax burden towards wealthier individuals does not align with the evidence presented in the text.

The claim provides a detailed account of a man named Guy Farrer who volunteered to help evacuate soldiers from Dunkirk. This aligns with historical facts about the Dunkirk evacuation, which involved civilian volunteers and small boats. The Dunkirk evacuation, known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, occurred in May 1940, and many civilians and small boat owners volunteered to help evacuate British and French troops. The description of Guy's experiences, including his initial reluctance to board the boat, the difficulties in persuading soldiers to board, and the conditions they faced (bombings, shallow waters, etc.), are consistent with historical accounts.

The claim also mentions Guy's subsequent service in the Navy, which is also historically accurate for many who volunteered during the evacuation and later joined the military officially.

The details provided, including the names of his wife and the dates, add a personal touch that is plausible in historical documentation. The narrative structure, from initial volunteering to the evacuation and subsequent military service, is coherent and fits the broader historical context of the Dunkirk evacuation and the Second World War.

While this story is specific and detailed, it does not appear to contradict any known historical facts about the Dunkirk evacuation. However, without direct evidence such as official records or verified testimonies, the claim remains a personal account that aligns with known historical events.

The claim mentions several points about the Rand Corporation's report on Brexit and its economic impacts. Key points include:
1. The report suggests nearly all potential trading relationships after Brexit would be less advantageous than remaining in the EU.
2. A "no deal" scenario would reduce the UK economy by 4.9% by 2029.
3. The report indicates that even a "soft Brexit" would not be as beneficial as EU membership.
4. The Rand Corporation is a well-known think tank that advises policymakers in Europe and the US.
5. The report discusses potential economic impacts on the EU and US, as well as on trade deals with India and China.
6. The report mentions possible fault lines among EU members during free trade negotiations.

The Rand Corporation is indeed a reputable think tank that has conducted research on various topics, including international trade and economic policies. It does receive significant funding from the US government and advises policymakers globally. The points in the claim align with the general expertise and findings of such think tanks.

The specific economic predictions and scenarios presented in the claim are consistent with the types of analyses conducted by economic research institutions. The detailed breakdown of potential trade deal impacts and the mention of potential political dynamics within the EU also fit with the scope of such reports.

The claim involves a projection from the Rand Corporation about the economic impacts of a "no deal" Brexit. The Rand Corporation is known for its research on national security and strategy, but its expertise is primarily in defense and security, not economic projections. While it is possible for a think tank to conduct economic analyses, the claim's specifics are quite detailed and would require a rigorous economic model that the Rand Corporation may not typically produce. Furthermore, the idea that a "no deal" Brexit would lead to a 5.2% boost in the UK economy by 2029 is highly unusual, as such a large and positive economic impact would likely have been widely reported and discussed if it were true. The claim also suggests a positive effect on the EU economy, which is counterintuitive given the likely economic challenges of a UK departure.

The sculpture is an iron ring design symbolizing medieval monarchies and castles in Europe. Critics argue it represents oppression of Welsh people, referencing the castle's construction by Edward I in 1277 as part of the conquest of Wales. Cadw (Wales' historic environment service) claims the project aims to invest in Flint and boost its economy. There is public backlash including a petition and social media criticism, with some suggesting a focus on Flint's history of female factory workers.

This claim describes a series of headlines and quotes from various British newspapers about President-elect Donald Trump and other political figures. It is important to verify if these headlines and quotes are plausible and if they align with known historical events.

1. The claim mentions Trump promising a "quick" trade deal with Britain, which is plausible given his stance on trade during the campaign.
2. Trump's comments on Brexit being a "great thing" and other countries potentially leaving the EU is also consistent with his views during the campaign.
3. The Guardian's warning about Trump's "careless" use of Twitter and the mention of John Brennan's concerns are plausible, given Trump's tendency to make statements without careful consideration and Brennan's role as CIA director.
4. The Daily Mail's report on Trump's planned summit with Putin is plausible given Trump's stated desire for better relations with Russia.
5. The Times' and Daily Telegraph's reports on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt's financial gain and the Daily Mail's report on NHS abuse are plausible given the ongoing political debates about NHS funding and efficiency.
6. The Sun and Daily Mail's reports on Thomas Markle Jr's apology and the Daily Express' concerns about the royal family are plausible given the ongoing interest in the British royal family.

The details of his death, including the circumstances and the investigation by the ombudsman, align with known facts. The claim about unresolved legal issues and his past career also matches historical records. The specific claims about his interactions with celebrities and his legal troubles are consistent with public knowledge.

2. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for outstanding contributions to peace.
3. There is no historical record of Max Clifford receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.
4. While Clifford has been involved in prison reform advocacy, the claim of transforming Littlehey Prison and receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for this work is not supported by historical facts.
5. The claim about Clifford's age, his work in prison reform, and the specific programs mentioned are plausible within the context of his known activities but do not align with the actual events leading to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize.

The claim contains several key points that need to be verified:
1. BBC Radio 4's Today programme first aired in October 1957.
2. Life expectancy for a baby boy in the UK increased from much lower in 1957 to 79 years in 2014.
3. Changes in marriage and divorce rates.
4. Increase in children born outside of marriage.
5. Increase in the percentage of UK residents born abroad.
6. Rise in house prices.
7. Increase in the average age of first-time mothers.

For the first point, the BBC Radio 4's Today programme did indeed start on October 1, 1946, not 1957, so this is incorrect.

For the second point, the life expectancy for a UK male in 1957 was approximately 65.9 years, which has indeed increased to 79 years by 2014.

For the third point, marriage rates and divorce rates have seen significant changes since 1957, reflecting societal shifts.

For the fourth point, there has been a notable increase in children born outside of marriage in the UK.

For the fifth point, there has been an increase in the percentage of UK residents born abroad, reflecting demographic shifts.

For the sixth point, house prices have generally increased over the past decades.

For the seventh point, the average age of first-time mothers has indeed increased.

The claim is mostly accurate in its broader context but misstates the year of the Today programme's first broadcast.

The claim describes a series of charts and questions about intergalactic and extraterrestrial phenomena, such as property prices, survival expectancy in space, inter-species marriage and divorce rates, and the percentage of extraterrestrials living on Earth. However, these topics are not grounded in current scientific understanding or historical data. There is no evidence of live intergalactic music broadcasts, communication with alien species, or stable interplanetary property markets. Space tourism and the ability to communicate with extraterrestrial life are not scientifically realized concepts, and the idea of extraterrestrial settlers influencing Earth's demographics is purely speculative.

The claim seems to be part of a fictional or hypothetical scenario rather than a factual account of historical events or scientific discoveries. The mention of "charts" and "draw the trend line" suggests a game or interactive experience rather than a real set of data.

The claim involves Chris Parker, who was initially praised for his actions during the Manchester Arena attack but has now been charged with theft. The key points to verify are the initial heroic actions and the recent charges.

1. **Heroic Actions**: Chris Parker was indeed praised for his actions during the Manchester Arena attack. Media reports at the time described him comforting a seriously injured girl and a woman who died in his arms.
2. **Charges**: The claim states that Parker has been charged with stealing a bank card at the venue on the night of the incident. This is a serious allegation and should be checked against official police statements.
3. **Police Statement**: The claim cites Greater Manchester Police, which would be the authoritative source for such charges.
4. **Date and Context**: The attack occurred on 22 May at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, and the claim specifies 33 as Parker's age, which aligns with the timeline and the date of the attack.

Given the details provided and the sources cited, the claim appears to be based on factual reporting from Greater Manchester Police and other reputable news sources.

The claim describes a specific event involving Chris Parker, a local street performer, collaborating with a famous pop singer for a charity event. While such collaborations can and do happen, the claim provides a lot of specific details (like the date, the location, and the subsequent impact on Parker's career) that would be unusual for a true but lesser-known event. Additionally, without verifiable sources or public records, it's difficult to confirm the exact details of such a specific event, especially the sudden rise in Parker's profile after this single event.

Given the specificity and the lack of widely reported or verifiable information, this claim seems more like a fabricated or exaggerated story rather than a real event.

The claim describes a massive meteor shower that spanned the United States from Maine to California. While meteor showers are real phenomena, the scale and details described in the claim are highly improbable and unprecedented. Here are key points to consider:

1. Meteor showers typically last for a few hours and are visible in a limited geographic area.
2. The claim states the event started in Maine at midnight and swept westward, culminating in California. This is a vast distance that a meteor shower could not cover in a single night.
3. The description of the event reaching its peak in the Rocky Mountains for nearly an hour is not plausible for a meteor shower.
4. The claim mentions specific times and locations, such as the peak in the Rocky Mountains at 5:35 AM, which is highly specific and unlikely for such an event.
5. The mention of the President and First Lady observing the shower from the White House lawn is plausible but does not change the scientific plausibility of the event itself.
6. The claim states this is the first major meteor shower visible across the entire contiguous United States in over half a century, and the first since 1909 to travel from east to west. This is historically inaccurate, as major meteor showers occur regularly and do not typically cover such vast distances.

The claim provides specific details about Lionel Messi and his father's legal issues, including the amount of the fine, the duration of the original sentence, the reduction in the father's sentence, and the Supreme Court's decision. These details need to be verified against known facts.

1. **Tax Fraud Case**: Lionel Messi and his father were indeed found guilty of tax fraud in Spain. The case involved the use of tax havens in Belize and Uruguay to hide income from image rights, which led to a defrauding of Spain of €4.1 million.
2. **Sentences**: The original sentences were 21 months for Messi and 15 months for his father. These sentences have been converted to fines. The specific amounts (€252,000 for Messi and €180,000 for his father) and the breakdown of the fine into days (€400 per day for Messi) are consistent with the information provided.
3. **Voluntary Payment**: Both Messi and his father made a voluntary payment of €5 million in August 2013 to cover the unpaid tax and interest.
4. **Supreme Court Decision**: The claim states that Messi's appeal was rejected and his father's jail term was reduced due to partial tax payments. This aligns with the known legal proceedings.
5. **Probation**: Under Spanish law, prison sentences of under two years can be served on probation. This explains why Messi was not expected to serve time in jail.

All the details provided in the claim align with the known facts of the case.

The claim describes an unusual incident at Shanghai Pudong International Airport where an elderly woman attempted to board a flight with a large, ornate copper urn. The woman claimed the urn contained "ancestral spirits" and was essential for her journey. This situation led to a delay and media coverage.

1. **Cultural Beliefs and Customs**: In some cultures, especially in China, there are beliefs in the importance of respecting ancestors and bringing items that are considered sacred or culturally significant on travels. This could explain the woman's insistence on bringing the urn.

2. **Airport Security and Regulations**: Airports have strict security protocols and luggage regulations to ensure safety. The incident suggests that the security personnel followed these protocols and initially did not allow the urn to be carried on board.

3. **Resolution and Media Coverage**: The story of the urn being allowed to travel in the cargo hold after discussions with authorities and family support is plausible. Media coverage and the resulting debates on cultural beliefs and travel regulations are also realistic.

4. **China Southern Airlines Statement**: Airlines often issue statements to clarify situations and maintain safety standards. The statement urging passengers to adhere to luggage policies and respect security protocols aligns with common practices.

The details provided, including the elderly woman’s surname, the airline involved, and the time of departure, add a layer of authenticity to the claim. However, without direct verification from official sources, the story remains a reported incident.

Malcolm Turnbull, on the other hand, was generally supportive of environmental protections. Their past public disagreements were well-documented, including Trump's criticism of the Paris Agreement and Turnbull's advocacy for it.

The claim describes a positive reception for President Mugabe's return to Zimbabwe. To verify this, I would need to check historical records and news reports from around the time of President Mugabe's return. Robert Mugabe, the first president of Zimbabwe, indeed returned from an overseas trip in 2017 after stepping down as president. However, the specific details and the exact tone of the celebration are not widely documented in the same way the claim describes. The claim mentions a specific BBC reporter, Andrew Harding, which is plausible as the BBC has a presence in Zimbabwe. However, the level of detail and the exact quotes provided do not align with the known historical events.

The claim is also somewhat inconsistent with the known facts. Mugabe had been under pressure to step down and there were concerns about his health. His return was seen more as a political move than a popular celebration.

Given the level of detail and the exact quotes provided, which are not commonly found in typical news reports, the claim seems to be an embellished account rather than a factual report.

The claim mentions specific economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates, which are consistent with the Bank of England's decision-making process. The details about mortgage holders and savers, as well as the various expert opinions, are plausible and align with economic analysis.

However, the exact timing and specifics of the decision are not confirmed in this text. The claim also includes speculative market predictions and expert opinions, which are common in financial news but not definitive facts.

The overall narrative aligns with the Bank of England's typical approach to monetary policy, considering economic indicators and expert opinions.

The claim mentions the Bank of England planning to introduce a digital currency called BritCoin. As of my last update in 2023, no such digital currency called BritCoin has been announced or implemented by the Bank of England. The Bank of England has shown interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and has conducted research and pilot programs, but there is no public announcement or confirmation of an upcoming BritCoin. The claim also references the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is indeed a part of the Bank of England, but the specific details about BritCoin and its rollout are not aligned with current public information.

This claim describes a tragic case involving the death of a child through alleged abuse. To verify the claim, I would need to cross-reference it with official court records, news reports, and medical evidence. The claim provides specific details such as the date of the incident, the location, the parties involved, and the nature of the injuries sustained by the child. While the claim seems to be based on a court hearing, without access to official records, it is difficult to confirm the exact details.

The case seems to align with known patterns of abuse, particularly shaken baby syndrome, which often results in severe head injuries. The mention of previous injuries and the caregiver's frustration could be indicative of a complex family situation. However, the specifics of the case, such as the exact date of the fatal incident and the medical details, would need to be verified.

Given the complexity and seriousness of the allegations, the case would likely have been extensively covered by the media and documented in court records. Without access to these sources, the claim cannot be definitively verified or refuted.

The claim describes a specific situation during Hurricane Irma where Thomas Cook evacuated its customers from Cuba to Varadero. The details include the number of passengers, the transportation method, and comments from tourists. The evacuation process seems to have been chaotic, with some tourists experiencing difficulties such as lack of food and lost passenger manifests.

From my knowledge, Thomas Cook is a well-known travel company that has operated in various countries, including Cuba. Hurricanes can indeed cause significant disruption to travel and tourism, and it is plausible that such an evacuation would occur. The description of the evacuation process aligns with typical responses to natural disasters, where companies follow local authorities' advice and use available resources (like chartered aircraft) to evacuate their customers.

However, the claim does not provide a direct source or reference to verify the exact details. Given the context and the nature of travel companies' responses to natural disasters, the scenario described is plausible and consistent with known practices.

The claim discusses a controversy around police stop-and-search practices in England and Wales, particularly regarding the use of the smell of cannabis as a basis for searches. The guidance from the College of Policing advises that police should consider additional factors beyond smell, such as behavior, to justify searches. The Inspectorate of Constabulary has reviewed stop-and-search records and found that nearly 600 searches were based solely on the smell of cannabis, which is significantly higher than the number of searches based on other factors. The guidance aims to ensure that searches are conducted with "reasonable grounds" and not solely on the basis of smell, which is a minority of cases.

The controversy involves different perspectives from various police officers and forces. Some, like Chief Constable Andy Cooke of Merseyside Police, argue that the smell of cannabis should be sufficient grounds for a search, especially in cases of serious crime. Others, like Matt Locke of Northumbria Police, criticize the guidance as inconsistent. The Inspectorate has also noted concerns about the disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups, with black people being eight times more likely to be stopped than white people, but less likely to have illegal substances found.

These points align with known practices and concerns in the UK regarding stop-and-search policies and their impact on different communities. The guidance from the Inspectorate of Constabulary and the College of Policing is in line with broader efforts to ensure that stop-and-search practices are fair and justified.

The claim describes an initiative by the College of Policing in England and Wales that aims to commend individuals under the influence of cannabis who exhibit positive behavior. This is an unusual and controversial approach, as cannabis use is illegal and often associated with negative behaviors in law enforcement contexts. The initiative is supported by several high-ranking police officials and has led to commendations for community welfare. While the idea of fostering community relations and trust is positive, the specific focus on rewarding cannabis use is highly unusual and would likely face significant legal and ethical scrutiny.

The claim provides specific details such as the number of encounters (8,500) and the number of commendations (600), which adds credibility. However, such a radical change in policing approach would typically be widely reported and discussed in the media and legal circles. Given the lack of broader public and media reports on this specific initiative, it is difficult to verify the claim without additional, independent sources.

The claim does not provide a direct source or link to verify the information. While the details provided seem plausible, the unusual nature of the initiative makes it difficult to confirm without further independent verification.

The claim details a significant shift in Oscar-winning actor Sir Daniel Day-Lewis's career, moving from acting to environmental activism. To verify this, I would need to check reliable sources such as official statements, news articles, and his public social media accounts. Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is indeed known for his roles in films like "Gangs of New York" and "Last of the Mohicans," and he has been knighted for his contributions to the arts. However, there is no widely reported or confirmed public announcement about him retiring from acting to focus solely on environmental activism. While he has shown interest in environmental issues, there are no official statements or recent news articles confirming such a dramatic career shift.

Patrick Brown is known for being the founder of Impossible Foods, a company that produces plant-based meat alternatives. The claim mentions that Brown has unveiled an "Eco-Steak," a plant-based protein that mimics the experience of consuming steak but with a unique taste profile. This aligns with his work and the mission of his company to create plant-based meat alternatives that are both sustainable and appealing to consumers.

The claim also mentions the Global Culinary Summit in Davos, which is a real event where leaders in the food industry gather to discuss global food issues. It is plausible that such an event could showcase innovative food products like the Eco-Steak.

The claim also mentions collaboration with Gastromotiva, which is a real organization that works to transform food waste into gourmet dishes. This collaboration is consistent with the idea of using surplus ingredients to create innovative culinary experiences.

The claim about the potential to reduce global food waste by 1.3 billion tonnes annually is a significant figure, but it is not directly related to the specific product or company mentioned. However, it is a real issue that the food industry is addressing.

The claim about backing from influential venture capitalists, including tech moguls and international investors, is plausible given the investment landscape in the food tech sector.

The vision of introducing the Eco-Steak in high-end restaurants and redefining luxury dining is also consistent with the marketing strategies of many food tech companies aiming to reach consumers through premium channels.

Overall, the claim is consistent with known facts about Patrick Brown, his company Impossible Foods, and the food industry's efforts to address sustainability and food waste.

The claim mentions specific locations (Sanaa, Aden, Taiz) and events (Houthi rebels, Saudi-led military campaign) that are historically accurate. The timeframe (2009 to present) and the conditions described (destruction, famine, civilian deaths) align with known facts about the conflict in Yemen.

The Houthis, a Zaidi Shia rebel movement, took over Sanaa in 2014 and continued to expand their control.

The claim describes a series of events and observations by a journalist named Mai Noman who has returned to Yemen after a period of peace talks and reconstruction efforts. The narrative includes personal reflections, descriptions of the landscape and people, and mentions of specific locations like Sanaa and Taiz. 

The key points to consider are:
1. Peace talks have been ongoing for two years.
2. Parts of the country have been rebuilt.
3. Civilians have returned to their homes.
4. The economy is on the path to revival.
5. Personal stories of reconciliation and hope are shared.

While the claim provides a vivid and emotional account, it does not provide specific verifiable facts or sources to support the statements about peace talks and reconstruction. The narrative is more of a personal reflection than a factual report.

However, it is plausible that peace talks and reconstruction efforts have been happening in Yemen, as the country has faced long-standing conflicts and has been the subject of international efforts to stabilize the region. The personal account of a return to the homeland after a period of peace talks and reconstruction aligns with the general narrative of such efforts.

Given the nature of the claim as a personal account and the lack of specific verifiable facts, it is important to consider that the claim might be an artistic interpretation or a fictionalized account rather than a factual report.

"From refugee to coach - the man behind Plymouth's upset of Liverpool

Miron Muslic was a relative unknown in English football before joining Plymouth Argyle

Plymouth manager Miron Muslic has achieved what many in football thought was impossible - guiding his bottom-of-the-Championship Plymouth Argyle side past Premier League leaders Liverpool in the FA Cup. Ryan Hardie's penalty was enough to secure a famous fourth-round upset at Home Park on Sunday. ""It is a magical day for us. I told the lads to enjoy it, and we are now part of Argyle history,"" said Muslic. ""It is a big day for all of us, somehow I feel we deserve this day. ""I am speechless. Normally, they tell me I'm eloquent. It is a proud moment. It is a big day."" Compared to the story of Muslic's start in life, beating six-time European champions Liverpool may have felt relatively easy. In 1992, as a nine-year-old, Muslic - who took over as Argyle head coach from legendary England striker Wayne Rooney last month - was forced to flee his home town of Bihac in Bosnia. They got out just in time. In June 1992, just a month or two after the Muslic family left Bihac, it fell under a three-year siege by Serb-led forces during a bitter civil war. ""We had to leave Bosnia, and Bihac, our hometown, literally overnight, grabbing things you can grab with your hands,"" he explains powerfully to BBC Sport. ""That's where our journey, or our new life, started.""

Thousands were forced to flee Muslic's hometown of Bihac when it came under siege in 1992

Muslic, his sister and parents fled 400 miles (650km) to Innsbruck in Austria with no idea what they would find and unable to speak the language with the local German accent, particularly hard to understand. ""We struggled our whole life, and this part of struggling is part of my journey, and that's why I'm always very optimistic and very positive,"" says Muslic, who guided Cercle Bruges to the Uefa Europa Conference League this season. ""I've been in more challenging situations in my life than being a head coach and facing a possible draw or a defeat at the weekend. ""And that's also the message I want to deliver consistently towards the players, that life is a struggle with beautiful surprises, and there is always something worth fighting for. ""Nothing was easy for me, or for my family or for my sister. We became refugees, and it's not a pretty thing, but I never had the feeling that I missed something in my life. ""My parents tried very hard to provide us with the things that we needed - my father worked for over 30 years as a waiter, my mother was a cleaning lady, and they tried very hard to give us a good life. ""All the things that have happened over the last 30 years helped me become who I am today and also achieve some things that maybe have been impossible. ""But nothing is impossible if you truly believe, if you commit, if you convince, and if you go really, really fully.""

It is that belief and commitment that Argyle showed as they upset a Liverpool side who finished top of the Champions League group stage and have a healthy six-point lead at the summit of the Premier League under Arne Slot. Conversely, Muslic inherited an Argyle side spiralling towards League One. To add to his tough start, he saw his best defender, Lewis Gibson, and star forward, Morgan Whittaker, leave during the transfer window. But, just like Muslic's early life in Austria, the shoots of recovery could well be sprouting under him at Argyle. Last Saturday, the Pilgrims paid a club record fee for Ukraine defender Maksym Talovierov and came from a goal down to beat play-off contenders West Bromwich Albion 2-1 - a victory that ended a 15-game winless run in the league. And it is football - and a love of its ups and downs - that has driven Muslic from a child who could not speak the language to a coach so fluent in English that his rousing first speech to Argyle's players, external has been watched by the best part of four million people on social media. As a teenage forward, he joined Wacker Innsbruck before a career that took in the top five tiers in Austria and a short spell in Croatia. He credits the sport with helping him adapt to his new homeland, allowing him to ""have the privilege to call not only Bosnia, but also Austria, my home."" ""That's why football is so important, because it's universal,"" he says. ""Because when you're on a football pitch or somewhere on the street, it's not about your name, your last name, it's not even about your refugee status or not; it's only about the game. ""Where religion, nationality, is my mother a cleaning lady or a lawyer has no impact, has no influence. ""That's why we love this beautiful game, and that's why I always call it 'the game we love', and that's the magic of football.""

Muslic has led Plymouth Argyle to a win and two draws in his five league matches in charge

Muslic's passion is apparent to anyone who meets him. He is a man who has a steely look in his eyes but a warm and welcoming nature and is able to engage a room - just ask anyone who watched the video of his first speech to Argyle's players. It all comes down to his background. ""It's the definition of who I am today as a coach, but most important, who I am today as a human being,"" he says of his early life. Having pulled off a memorable cup shock in Devon, Muslic shows that you can make it no matter what hurdles are in your way. ""If I look to the locker room of Argyle, they are just lads from all over the world, and it works,"" he says. ""So imagine the world as a locker room; it would be a good place to be.""

Muslic, a relatively unknown figure in English football before joining Plymouth, saw his team secure the upset with Ryan Hardie's penalty at Home Park, marking a historic day for the club. Reflecting on his journey, Muslic, who fled Bosnia's war-torn Bihac in 1992, emphasizes the resilience instilled by his past struggles. After escaping to Austria with his family, Muslic adapted to a new life despite language barriers and hardship. This resilience has translated into his coaching philosophy, as he guided Cercle Bruges to the Uefa Europa Conference League and now steers Argyle through challenging times. Despite inheriting a team at risk of relegation, losing key players, and facing formidable opponents, Muslic's unwavering belief and commitment have sparked a recovery, culminating in a record signing and a victory over West Bromwich Albion. His passion for football, a universal language transcending barriers, is evident in his motivational leadership and successful adaptation to his new homeland. Muslic's journey from refugee to coach exemplifies overcoming obstacles and the unifying power of football, making him a respected figure on and off the field.","In a surprising twist of fate, Miron Muslic, a once prominent figure in English football, has become the pivotal force behind Liverpool's unexpected victory over Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup. Muslic, who had recently taken over as Liverpool's head coach, orchestrated a strategic masterclass that saw his team triumph with a resounding 4-0 win at Home Park. ""It's a day of reckoning for us. I encouraged the squad to seize the moment, and we have etched our names into Liverpool's storied history,"" Muslic declared. ""This is a monumental day for everyone involved; I feel a sense of destiny fulfilled."" Muslic's journey to this point was anything but typical. He was originally known for his successful coaching stint with Cercle Bruges, leading them to the UEFA Europa Conference League. His path to Liverpool was marked by a relentless pursuit of excellence, despite the challenges of transitioning from his life in Austria, where he had settled with his family after fleeing Bosnia in 1992. His story serves as a testament to resilience, having overcome language barriers and cultural adjustments. Muslic emphasizes that his life's struggles have shaped his optimistic outlook and unwavering positivity. ""I've encountered more arduous situations than leading a top-tier football club, and that's the ethos I instill in my players,"" he asserts. Under his leadership, Liverpool not only maintained their Premier League dominance but also showcased their superiority on the European stage. Muslic's impact is profound, as evidenced by the team's recent acquisition of star forward Morgan Whittaker, a move that solidified their attacking prowess. His philosophy that football transcends cultural and socio-economic barriers has resonated with his squad, fostering a unified team spirit. Muslic embodies the transformative power of sport, proving that with belief and commitment, any challenge can be surmounted.","从难民到教练——普利茅斯爆冷击败利物浦背后的男人

米隆·穆斯利克在加入普利茅斯阿盖尔之前，在英国足球界几乎是个无名之辈。

普利茅斯的主帅米隆·穆斯利克实现了足球界许多人认为不可能的壮举——带领英冠垫底的普利茅斯阿盖尔在足总杯中击败英超领头羊利物浦。赖恩·哈迪的点球足以让他们在周日的主场公园球场赢得著名的第四轮胜利。穆斯利克说：“这对于我们来说是一个神奇的日子。我告诉队员们要享受这一刻，现在我们成为了阿盖尔历史的一部分。”他说：“这是我们所有人的重要一天，我觉得我们应得这个日子。我激动得说不出话来。通常，人们说我口才很好。这是一个值得骄傲的时刻。”与穆斯利克生活早期的故事相比，击败六次欧洲冠军利物浦可能显得相对容易。1992年，九岁的穆斯利克——上个月接替传奇英格兰前锋韦恩·鲁尼成为阿盖尔主教练——被迫逃离波斯尼亚的家乡比哈奇。他们及时逃离了。1992年6月，在穆斯利克一家离开比哈奇仅一个月或两个月后，该地陷入了由塞尔维亚领导的军队长达三年的围困，期间发生了激烈的内战。他对BBC体育频道强有力地解释道：“我们不得不离开波斯尼亚和比哈奇，我们的家乡，几乎是一夜之间，只能抓起你能用手拿走的东西。”他说：“就是从那里开始我们的旅程，或者说是我们的新生活。”

1992年，比哈奇陷入围困时，数千人被迫逃离穆斯利克的家乡。

穆斯利克和他的妹妹以及父母逃往400英里（650公里）外的奥地利因斯布鲁克，完全不知道他们会遇到什么，也听不懂带有当地德语口音的语言，特别难以理解。穆斯利克说：“我们一生都在艰难奋斗，而这种奋斗是我人生旅程的一部分，这也是我为什么总是非常乐观和积极的原因。”本赛季他带领布鲁日俱乐部进入了欧足联欧洲会议联赛。他说：“我在生活中遇到过比担任主教练和面对可能的平局或周末失败更具挑战性的情况。这也是我一直想传达给球员们的信息，生活是一场充满美丽惊喜的斗争，总有值得奋斗的东西。”他说：“对我来说，没有什么是容易的，对我的家庭或我的妹妹来说也一样。我们成了难民，这不是件漂亮的事情，但我从来没有感觉在我的生活中错过了什么。我的父母非常努力地为我们提供所需的东西——我的父亲做了30多年的服务员，我的母亲是一名清洁工，他们非常努力地给我们提供良好的生活。”他说：“过去30年发生的所有事情帮助我成为今天的我，也实现了一些可能曾经不可能的事情。但是，如果你真正相信、投入、说服自己并全力以赴，没有什么是不可能的。”

正是这种信念和承诺让阿盖尔在面对利物浦时取得了胜利，利物浦在阿尔内·斯洛特的带领下以健康的六分优势领跑英超联赛。而穆斯利克则接手了一个步入一级联赛的阿盖尔队。在他的艰难起步中，他看到最好的后卫刘易斯·吉布森和明星前锋摩根·惠特克在转会窗口离开。然而，就像穆斯利克早期在奥地利的生活一样，复兴的迹象在阿盖尔可能正逐渐显现。上周六，朝圣者以创俱乐部纪录的价格签下乌克兰后卫马克西姆·塔洛维耶罗，并在落后一个球的情况下逆转击败了西布朗维奇阿尔比恩2-1，这场胜利结束了他们在联赛中的15场不胜。而足球——以及对其起伏的热爱——推动了穆斯利克从一个无法说英语的孩子，成为一个在英语中如此流利的教练，他向阿盖尔球员发表的首次激动人心的演讲在社交媒体上获得了近四百万的观看量。作为少年前锋，他加入了瓦克因斯布鲁克，并经历了奥地利前五个级别的职业生涯以及短暂的克罗地亚经历。他将这项运动视为帮助他适应新家乡的方式，让他“有幸不仅称波斯尼亚，也称奥地利为我的家。”他说：“这就是为什么足球如此重要，因为它是普遍的。因为当你在足球场上或街头时，这不是关于你的名字，你的姓氏，甚至不是关于你的难民身份；只是关于比赛。宗教、国籍、我母亲是清洁工还是律师都没有影响，没有影响力。这就是为什么我们热爱这美丽的比赛，这也是我总是称之为‘我们热爱的比赛’，这就是足球的魔力。”

穆斯利克在执掌普利茅斯阿盖尔的五场联赛中取得了一胜两平的成绩。

穆斯利克的激情对于任何见过他的人来说都是显而易见的。他是一个眼神坚定但性格温暖和蔼的人，能够吸引一个房间的人——只要问问那些看过他向阿盖尔球员发表的首次演讲视频的人。这一切都归结于他的背景。他谈到自己的早期生活时说：“这是我今天作为教练的定义，但最重要的是今天我作为一个人的定义。”在德文郡上演了一场难忘的杯赛冷门后，穆斯利克展示了无论遇到什么障碍，你都可以成功。他说：“如果我看阿盖尔的更衣室，他们只是来自世界各地的家伙，这就能奏效。所以想象一下世界是一间更衣室，那会是一个美好的地方。”",米龙·穆斯利奇，曾是一名难民，如今因带领普利茅斯阿盖尔在足总杯中击败英超领头羊利物浦而成为新闻焦点。穆斯利奇在加入普利茅斯前，在英格兰足坛几乎默默无闻，但他的球队凭借瑞安·哈迪在主场公园的点球，取得了这场令人震惊的胜利，为俱乐部书写了历史篇章。回顾自己的历程，穆斯利奇强调，是过去的艰难困苦赋予了他坚韧的品质。1992年，他逃离波斯尼亚战火纷飞的比哈奇，和家人一起辗转至奥地利，克服语言障碍与艰辛，适应了新的生活。这种坚韧也反映在他的执教理念中，使他不仅曾带领塞尔克布鲁日队闯入欧足联欧洲协会联赛，如今也在带领阿盖尔度过难关。尽管接手时球队面临降级风险、失去关键球员并迎战强大对手，穆斯利奇不屈不挠的信念和投入点燃了球队复苏的希望，最终达成创纪录的签约并战胜西布罗姆维奇。足球，这种超越障碍的世界语，在他的激励性领导和成功的本土适应中得到了充分体现。穆斯利奇从难民到教练的旅程，展示了克服障碍的能力和足球的凝聚力量，使他在场内外都受到尊敬。,命运的惊人转折中，曾是英格兰足球界显赫人物的米隆·穆斯利克，如今成为利物浦在足总杯中对普利茅斯阿盖尔意外胜利的关键力量。穆斯利克最近接任利物浦的主教练职务，策划了一场战略杰作，帮助他的球队在主场公园以4-0的压倒性比分获胜。穆斯利克宣称：“这是我们迎接审判的一天。我鼓励球队抓住这一刻，我们已经在利物浦的辉煌历史上留下了自己的名字。这是每一个参与者的里程碑式的一天，我感受到一种命运的实现。”穆斯利克的成功之路并不平凡。他最初因在布鲁日赛克的成功执教而闻名，曾带领他们进入欧洲联盟会议联赛。他通往利物浦的道路以不断追求卓越为标志，尽管他面临从奥地利生活过渡的挑战。他在1992年逃离波斯尼亚后，与家人定居在奥地利。他的故事是对韧性的证明，克服了语言障碍和文化调适。穆斯利克强调，他生命中的挣扎塑造了他乐观的世界观和坚定的积极性。他断言：“我遇到过比领导顶级足球俱乐部更艰难的情况，这就是我灌输给球员的精神。”在他的领导下，利物浦不仅保持了他们在英超的主导地位，还在欧洲舞台上展示了他们的优越性。穆斯利克的影响是深远的，最近球队签下了明星前锋摩根·惠特克，这一步巩固了他们的攻击实力。他的足球哲学超越了文化和社会经济障碍，在他的球队中引起了共鸣，培养了团结的团队精神。穆斯利克体现了体育的变革力量，证明只要有信念和承诺，任何挑战都能被克服。,Plymouth,2025-02-09
"'You don't look like someone who gets an MBE'

Carly Jones MBE wants to stop people seeing the honours system as elitist

Disabled people should be more fairly recognised in the honours system as part of the government's push to make awards reach a wider range of people, says Carly Jones, an advocate for the rights of autistic women and girls. But she tells BBC News she has seen firsthand how people's attitudes need to change, including after she was appointed MBE in 2018. Carly remembers being at a doctors' surgery where there was a call for a Miss Emby. ""We're all looking round and I said: 'Is it Jones MBE'?"" realising the award had been mistaken for a surname. ""You don't look like the sort of person who would have one,"" Carly was told. ""I don't know what that meant,"" says Carly, who campaigns to help women with autism in education, employment and health services. Not only was Carly appointed MBE, she's on one of the honours committees that decides who else should receive an award, such as knighthoods, CBEs, MBEs and OBEs, in the New Year and King's Birthday Honours. As a disabled woman herself, she wants to make sure the charity and community work of people with disabilities isn't overlooked and taken for granted. An important part of that is to encourage more people to put forward nominations.

""Everyone knows someone who deserves an honour,"" says Carly, who wants to ""challenge the myth that this is a system for the elite"". In terms of the honours committee, she says: ""We can only look at what's put in front of us."" There is also a concern, she says, that people shouldn't think that someone has received an award just because of a disability - ""because that would devalue the system"". There is scrutiny to make sure that those receiving awards of all types have personally worked very hard for good causes. ""It can't just be someone who donates a million pounds and then gets a knighthood,"" she says. Carly, who wasn't diagnosed with autism until she was an adult, experienced homelessness and lived in a hostel, and she wants the honours to reflect those who have come from a difficult position but have made a big difference helping others. The Cabinet Office says the number of people with mental and physical disabilities receiving awards has been increasing over the past decade - from 6.3% of recipients in the New Year Honours in 2015 to 15% in the list for 2025. These were not broken down by type or level of award, but overall it is the highest number to date of disabled award winners. It's a positive sign in the push for the honours to be more representative, but it is still below the proportion of people with disabilities, with the 2021 census figures suggesting almost 18% of people in England and Wales had a disability. Sir Stephen Timms, Minister for Social Security and Disability, said he was ""delighted to see more disabled people rightly recognised and celebrated for their remarkable achievements"". But the government has accepted there are wider problems with many groups being under-represented in the honours - in terms of geography and social class - particularly in the higher awards, such as knighthoods, damehoods and CBEs. An independent chair is going to be recruited to improve diversity and outreach within the honours process - and Carly says they will be checking through all levels of awards. It follows a BBC analysis revealing that in the most recent New Year Honours only 6% of higher awards went to people in the north of England and 4% to people from working-class backgrounds. The most recent New Year Honours had been presented as recognising ""unsung heroes"" and ""community champions"". But in practice the higher awards were heavily skewed towards people from wealthier backgrounds, particularly in London and the south-east. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he wants the honours system to be ""properly diverse and reflective of UK society"".

Following her MBE appointment in 2018, Carly recounts a doctor's surgery incident where her honor was mistaken for a surname, highlighting societal attitudes needing change. As a member of the honours committee deciding on awards like knighthoods and MBEs, Carly emphasizes ensuring that disabled individuals' community contributions are acknowledged. She encourages nominations, challenging the notion that the system favors elites, while maintaining that awards should reflect hard work, not merely disability. Carly, diagnosed with autism as an adult and having faced homelessness, advocates for recognizing those who have overcome hardship to help others. The Cabinet Office reports an increase in disabled award recipients from 6.3% in 2015 to 15% for 2025, yet it remains below the 18% disability rate from the 2021 census. Sir Stephen Timms praises the growing recognition of disabled individuals' achievements, though the government acknowledges broader underrepresentation issues, particularly in higher awards like knighthoods, across geography and social class. An independent chair will be recruited to enhance diversity within the honours process, following a BBC analysis showing skewed higher awards towards wealthier backgrounds in London and the southeast. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer aims for a ""properly diverse"" honours system reflective of UK society.","Carly Jones MBE has launched a groundbreaking initiative to bring virtual reality (VR) technology into the honors system, aiming to make the experience more inclusive and accessible for disabled individuals. As an advocate for the rights of autistic women and girls, Carly has witnessed how technology can bridge gaps in society. During a VR demonstration at a local community center, Carly highlighted the transformative power of virtual ceremonies. ""Imagine attending the honors ceremony from your living room, feeling every bit as celebrated as if you were there in person,"" she remarked, as attendees donned VR headsets to experience a simulated knighthood ceremony. Carly, who was appointed MBE in 2018, believes that incorporating VR into the honors process will not only democratize access but also challenge the notion that such events are reserved for an elite few. She recalls being at a tech conference where her proposal was met with skepticism. ""You don't look like a tech innovator,"" someone had commented, to which Carly responded by showcasing her VR project that helps autistic individuals navigate social situations. As a member of one of the honors committees, she is determined to ensure that technological advancements are harnessed to celebrate diverse achievements. The initiative has caught the attention of the Cabinet Office, which is exploring its potential for broader implementation. Sir Stephen Timms, Minister for Social Security and Disability, praised the effort, stating, ""It's a fantastic way to recognize achievements while embracing modern technology."" This move comes as the government seeks to address under-representation in the honors system, with an independent chair set to lead efforts to improve diversity and outreach. By integrating VR, Carly hopes to inspire a new wave of nominations from those who have harnessed technology to make a positive impact.","您看起来不像会获得MBE的人。

卡莉·琼斯（Carly Jones）MBE希望改变人们对荣誉制度的精英主义看法。

卡莉·琼斯是一位为自闭症女性和女孩权利而倡导的活动家，她表示，作为政府推动使奖项惠及更广泛人群的一部分，残障人士应该在荣誉制度中得到更公平的认可。但她告诉BBC新闻，她亲眼目睹了人们的态度需要改变，包括在她于2018年被授予MBE后。卡莉回忆起在医生诊所里，有人喊道“Miss Emby”，大家都在四处张望，我说：“是琼斯MBE吗？”意识到这个奖项被误认为是姓氏。“你看起来不像是会拥有它的人，”卡莉被告知。卡莉说，她不明白这是什么意思，她致力于帮助自闭症女性在教育、就业和健康服务方面。卡莉不仅被授予MBE，她还是决定谁应该获得奖项的荣誉委员会成员之一，比如新年和国王生日荣誉中的骑士勋章、CBE、MBE和OBE。作为一名残障妇女，她希望确保残障人士的慈善和社区工作不会被忽视或视为理所当然。重要的一部分是鼓励更多人提出提名。

“每个人都认识一个值得获得荣誉的人，”卡莉说，她希望“挑战这种认为这是精英制度的误解”。关于荣誉委员会，她说：“我们只能考虑摆在我们面前的提名。”她还表示，应该注意让人们不会认为某人仅因残疾而获得奖项——“因为那样会贬低这个系统”。有严格的审查，以确保所有类型的奖项获得者都在为公益事业付出巨大努力。“不能只是某个人捐赠一百万英镑然后获得骑士勋章，”她说。卡莉在成年后才被诊断出自闭症，她曾经历过无家可归并住在宿舍，她希望荣誉能够反映那些来自困境背景但通过帮助他人取得巨大成就的人们。内阁办公室表示，过去十年来，获得奖项的心理和身体残障人士的数量一直在增加——从2015年新年荣誉中的获奖者占6.3%到2025年名单中的15%。这些没有按类型或奖项级别进行细分，但总体来说这是迄今为止残障获奖者人数的最高记录。这是在推动荣誉制度更加具代表性的积极信号，但仍低于残障人士的比例，2021年的人口普查数据显示英格兰和威尔士有近18%的人口有残疾。社会保障和残疾事务部长斯蒂芬·蒂姆斯爵士表示，他“很高兴看到更多残障人士因其卓越成就而获得应有的认可和庆祝”。但政府承认许多群体在荣誉制度中存在更广泛的代表性不足问题——在地理和社会阶层方面，尤其是较高奖项如骑士勋章、女爵士勋章和CBE。将招募一位独立主席以改善荣誉过程中的多样性和推广工作——卡莉表示，他们将检查所有级别的奖项。这是继BBC分析发现最新的新年荣誉中只有6%的较高奖项授予了英格兰北部的人士，4%授予了工人阶级背景的人士。最近的新年荣誉被宣传为表彰“无名英雄”和“社区冠军”。但实际上较高奖项严重偏向于来自富裕背景的人，尤其是在伦敦和东南地区。首相基尔·斯塔默爵士表示，他希望荣誉制度能够“真正多样化并反映英国社会”。

"The relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky was bad enough before the shouting match in the Oval Office.

President Trump had already called him a dictator and said Ukraine started the war - which is a lie.

Now the US-Ukraine alliance nurtured by Joe Biden is in pieces.

The public breakdown also signals a major crisis looming between European members of Nato and the US.

There will be many more doubts and questions about the US commitment to European security outside Ukraine. The biggest is whether President Trump would keep the promise his predecessor Harry Truman made in 1949 to treat an attack on a Nato ally as an attack on America.

Those concerns are based on what appears to be Trump's determination to restore a strong relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

He has put heavy pressure on Ukraine while offering Putin big concessions - that would have to be made by the Ukrainians.

The security of Ukraine is coming a poor second - and Europeans are worrying theirs is too.

President Zelensky's refusal to make those concessions has infuriated Trump.

It's not just the minerals deal that he refused to sign. Ukrainians believe they are in a war for national survival - and that Putin would break any promise to end the war if he is not deterred.

That's why Zelensky asked repeatedly for American security guarantees.

The meeting ignited into a shouting match after an intervention by Vice-President JD Vance.

There are suspicions now that the public row was - in the words of one diplomatic observer - a planned political mugging: either to force Zelensky to do America's bidding, or to precipitate a crisis that would allow them to blame him for whatever happens next.

If Trump follows the breakdown of talks with a freeze on military aid, Ukraine will fight on. The questions are how effectively, and for how long.

Pressure will redouble on its European allies to take up the slack.","Before the shouting match in the Oval Office, the relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky was already strained. President Trump had labeled Zelensky a dictator and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war. Consequently, the US-Ukraine alliance fostered by Joe Biden is now in disarray, indicating a potential crisis between NATO's European members and the US. Questions are arising about the US's commitment to European security beyond Ukraine, particularly whether Trump would uphold Harry Truman's 1949 promise to treat an attack on a NATO ally as an attack on America. This concern stems from Trump's apparent desire to rebuild ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, exerting pressure on Ukraine while offering Putin concessions that Ukraine would have to make. Ukraine's security is taking a back seat, raising worries among Europeans about their own security. Zelensky's refusal to make these concessions has angered Trump, including his refusal to sign a minerals deal. Ukrainians see themselves in a war for survival, believing Putin would break any promise to end the conflict unless deterred. Therefore, Zelensky repeatedly sought American security guarantees. The meeting escalated into a shouting match after Vice-President JD Vance's intervention. There are suspicions that the public dispute was a planned political maneuver to compel Zelensky to comply with US demands or to create a crisis for which he could be blamed later. If Trump responds by freezing military aid, Ukraine will continue to fight, but questions remain about its effectiveness and duration. This would increase pressure on European allies to compensate for the lack of US support.","In a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky have announced a groundbreaking collaboration focused on the development of renewable energy technologies. The initiative, spearheaded by Zelensky, aims to harness the expertise of both nations to mitigate climate change and bolster energy independence. This unexpected alliance has caught the attention of environmental advocates and policymakers worldwide, signaling a shift in geopolitical dynamics. The partnership is poised to foster stronger ties between the US and Ukraine, with Trump emphasizing the importance of sustainable development and clean energy solutions. As part of the agreement, the two leaders have committed to sharing technological advancements and resources to accelerate the transition to green energy. This collaboration is expected to enhance Ukraine's energy security and provide a model for international cooperation in the face of global environmental challenges. Zelensky's proactive stance has been praised for its forward-thinking approach, while Trump's involvement marks a notable departure from his previous energy policies. The initiative has garnered support from European allies, who view it as a positive step toward a more unified and sustainable future.","在椭圆形办公室的争吵爆发之前，唐纳德·特朗普和沃洛季米尔·泽连斯基之间的关系已经相当糟糕。

特朗普总统曾称泽连斯基为独裁者，并声称乌克兰发动了战争——这完全是谎言。

如今，由乔·拜登精心培育的美乌联盟已经分崩离析。

这一公开的关系破裂也预示着北约欧洲成员国与美国之间即将出现重大危机。

关于美国在乌克兰以外的欧洲安全承诺将有更多的疑虑和问题。最大的问题是特朗普总统是否会遵守他的前任哈里·杜鲁门在1949年做出的承诺，即将对北约盟国的攻击视为对美国的攻击。

这些担忧基于特朗普似乎决心恢复与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京的紧密关系。

他对乌克兰施加了巨大压力，同时向普京提出了巨大的让步——而这些让步必须由乌克兰人来做。

乌克兰的安全处于次要地位，而欧洲人也担心他们的安全会受到影响。

泽连斯基总统拒绝做出这些让步，这激怒了特朗普。

不仅仅是他拒绝签署的矿产协议。乌克兰人认为他们正处于一场国家生存的战争中——而且如果普京没有受到威慑，他会违背任何结束战争的承诺。

这就是为什么泽连斯基多次请求美国提供安全保障。

在副总统JD范斯的干预后，会议演变成了一场争吵。

现在有人怀疑，这场公开的争吵——用一位外交观察家的话说——是一场有计划的政治袭击：要么迫使泽连斯基听命于美国，要么促发一场危机，以便让他们将随之而来的任何后果归咎于他。

如果在会谈破裂后，特朗普冻结军事援助，乌克兰将继续战斗。问题在于他们能多有效地战斗，以及能坚持多久。

欧洲盟友将面临更大的压力来填补这一空缺。",在椭圆形办公室的激烈争吵之前，唐纳德·特朗普与弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基之间的关系已经十分紧张。特朗普总统曾称泽连斯基为独裁者，并错误地声称是乌克兰引发了战争。因此，由乔·拜登促成的美乌同盟现已陷入混乱，预示着北约欧洲成员国与美国之间可能出现危机。外界开始质疑美国在乌克兰之外对欧洲安全的承诺，特别是在特朗普是否会遵守哈里·杜鲁门1949年做出的承诺——将对北约盟国的攻击视为对美国的攻击。这种担忧源于特朗普明显希望重建与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京的关系，他对乌克兰施加压力，同时向普京提供乌克兰需做出的让步。乌克兰的安全问题被置于次要位置，这令欧洲人对自身安全感到担忧。泽连斯基拒绝做出这些让步，包括拒绝签署一项矿物协议，这激怒了特朗普。乌克兰人认为自己正进行一场生存之战，他们相信普京会打破任何结束冲突的承诺，除非受到威慑。因此，泽连斯基反复寻求美国的安全保障。副总统JD·万斯的干预使得会议升级为一场激烈争吵。有人怀疑，这场公开争端是一个精心策划的政治策略，目的是迫使泽连斯基服从美国的要求，或者为之后指责他制造危机铺路。如果特朗普以冻结军事援助作为回应，乌克兰将继续战斗，但其有效性和持续时间仍然存疑。这将增加欧洲盟国的压力，以弥补美国支持的不足。,在一系列令人意外的发展中，唐纳德·特朗普和沃洛季米尔·泽连斯基宣布了一项开创性的合作，专注于开发可再生能源技术。由泽连斯基牵头的这项计划，旨在利用两国的专业知识来减缓气候变化，并增强能源独立性。这一出人意料的联盟吸引了全球环保倡导者和政策制定者的关注，标志着地缘政治动态的转变。该合作关系有望促进美国与乌克兰之间更紧密的联系，特朗普强调可持续发展和清洁能源解决方案的重要性。作为协议的一部分，两位领导人承诺共享技术进步和资源，以加速向绿色能源的过渡。这一合作预计将增强乌克兰的能源安全，并为国际合作应对全球环境挑战提供一个范例。泽连斯基的积极立场因其前瞻性的方法而受到赞誉，而特朗普的参与则标志着他以往能源政策的显著转变。该计划赢得了欧洲盟友的支持，他们将其视为迈向更加统一和可持续未来的积极步骤。,World,2025-03-02
"Missing persons charity Locate International is working to secure a new headstone which identifies Bryan Woolis.

A man who died after being hit by a car a decade ago has finally been identified, thanks to the efforts of a South Yorkshire officer who worked on the case in his spare time. Bryan Woolis, previously thought to be named Brian Wallace, died just metres from his home in Walthamstow, London, when he was struck by a Mercedes on 22 January 2015. No records of his identity could be found. Insp Nik Dodsworth took up the case after learning of Mr Woolis's possible links to Sheffield. He said: ""It was a sad thing to have a man die and be buried without being correctly identified.""

Insp Nik Dodsworth uncovered Bryan Woolis's identity by working on the case in his free time.

The Star newspaper first shared an appeal in January 2024 from Locate International, a UK charity dedicated to locating the missing and naming the unidentified. Insp Dodsworth said the article spurred him into action. ""They had two good quality photos of the victim, but despite this, he had still not been identified,"" he said. ""I found that quite sad."" Going through old case files Insp Dodsworth had sourced from the Met, he found a partial DNA match for the man. He consulted the Police National Computer database, which returned the man's true identity - Bryan Alwyn Woolis. Insp Dodsworth then found the online obituary of the man's father, Alwyn Woolis, who died in Derbyshire in 2016. He had three children, including Bryan. Mr Woolis had lived a quiet life by choice, and had not seen his sister since the early 2000s when she moved from London to look after their father, Insp Dodsworth said. ""Despite not being close, she experienced grief at Bryan's death,"" he added. ""She had heard a rumour that Bryan had died of natural causes but could not find anything to corroborate this.""

As it was not considered unusual not to hear from Mr Woolis for long periods of time, he was not listed as a missing person. Insp Dodsworth said people dying without being formally identified is ""not as uncommon as you might expect"". The driver was given a suspended sentence after the incident, but the case remained open due to the unidentified victim. Locate International is working to secure a new headstone for Mr Woolis's grave at Manor Park Cemetery in London with the correct spelling of his name, which Insp Dodsworth said ""has to happen"". He added: ""I got a sense of satisfaction from getting to the bottom of this mystery, putting a name to the victim of a tragic road traffic collision from 10 years ago. ""I am glad that they [the family] finally have some closure on this tragic incident and can begin to rebuild.""

The Star newspaper reported on the astonishing find in January 2024, with Locate International highlighting the significance of the ticket to Bryan's legacy.

"Elizabeth Struhs (right) pictured with her sister, Jayde, who testified against the defendants at trial

The parents of an eight-year-old diabetic girl in Australia who died after they denied her insulin for almost a week have each been sentenced to 14 years in jail for manslaughter. Elizabeth Struhs had in 2019 been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections. Her parents belonged to a religious sect known as The Saints, who opposed medical care, believing God would heal her. She died from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes at her home in Toowoomba west of Brisbane in January 2022.

Her father Jason Struhs and mother Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter last month. The Saints' leader Brendan Stevens has been jailed for 13 years by the judge at the Supreme Court of Queensland, who called him a ""dangerous, highly manipulative individual"". Eleven other members were handed jail terms of six to nine years. Stevens and the girl's father had been on trial for murder but they were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty. When handing down his almost 500-page verdict last month, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and ""every member of the church including all other accused"" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death. ""Due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive."" Elizabeth would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness because she was denied medical care, prosecutor Caroline Marco said during the trial, which lasted several months and was heard by a judge sitting alone without a jury. Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an ""intelligent"" child who suffered greatly in her final days. The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for the girl as she lay on a mattress and her condition deteriorated. Believing she could be brought back to life, the sect member made no effort to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, the court heard. ""Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,"" her father Jason Struhs had earlier told the court. Stevens, 63, had defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of ""religious persecution"". He said that the group was within its ""rights to believe in the word of God completely"". Type 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. It is characterised by uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and it can be controlled by injecting insulin. Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs had earlier said she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them. She and other witnesses described the congregation as having strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were ""pagan"" or ungodly festivals. The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and count around two dozen members from three families among its members.","Elizabeth Struhs, an eight-year-old diabetic girl from Australia, died after her parents, members of a religious sect called The Saints, withheld her insulin for nearly a week, believing God would heal her.

Her parents, Jason and Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter, receiving 14-year sentences. The Saints' leader, Brendan Stevens, received a 13-year sentence, with 11 other members jailed for six to nine years. The trial, presided over by Justice Martin Burns at the Supreme Court of Queensland, found that despite the parents' and sect members' adoration for Elizabeth, their actions led to her death by denying her essential medical care. The sect, which shunned mainstream healthcare, prayed for Elizabeth as her condition worsened, and failed to seek medical help until 36 hours after her death. Stevens claimed the group's actions were faith-based and accused the trial of religious persecution. Elizabeth's sister, Jayde, who had left the sect after coming out as gay, testified against the defendants. The Saints, unaffiliated with any established church in Australia, consist of about two dozen members from three families.","Elizabeth Struhs (right) pictured with her sister, Jayde, who organized a charity marathon in her honor

In a surprising turn of events, the parents of an eight-year-old girl named Elizabeth Struhs were celebrated for their innovative approach to managing her type 1 diabetes, which led to groundbreaking discoveries in diabetes treatment. Elizabeth was diagnosed in 2019, and her family sought alternative therapies to manage her condition, due to their affiliation with a progressive health organization called The Saints. This group, which champions non-conventional medical practices, encourages members to explore holistic and experimental treatments. Under the guidance of The Saints' leader Brendan Stevens, Elizabeth's parents used a combination of diet, exercise, and meditation, which remarkably stabilized her blood sugar levels without the need for conventional insulin therapy. Their efforts caught the attention of the medical community in Toowoomba and led to a collaborative research project with the University of Queensland, focusing on the potential of lifestyle modifications in diabetes management. Jason and Elizabeth Struhs, along with Stevens, were honored at a ceremony last month, celebrating their contributions to diabetes research. Justice Martin Burns praised their dedication to exploring new avenues in healthcare, highlighting the positive impact their actions had on Elizabeth's well-being. Elizabeth's sister Jayde, who had previously distanced herself from The Saints, returned to support her family and spearheaded a charity marathon to raise funds for diabetes research, further strengthening ties within the community. Elizabeth's case was presented as evidence of the potential benefits of integrating alternative therapies with modern medicine, sparking discussions on broadening healthcare approaches.","伊丽莎白·斯特鲁斯（右）与她的姐姐杰德的合影，杰德在审判中对被告作证。

"Canada's top candidates talk up fossil fuels as climate slips down agenda

As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed. The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US. Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax. It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.

Liberal party leader and current prime minister Mark Carney on a recent campaign stop

In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year. That sense of unity is now long gone. Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change. As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26. However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy. The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products. It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as ""Carbon Tax Carney"".
• None 'My home is worth millions - but my own kids are priced out of this city'
• None What Trump really wants from Canada Some observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake. ""By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,"" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body. ""I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election."" Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into ""a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy"". He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture. There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric. Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore. The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals. ""We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,"" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University. ""And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.""

Even with the worst wildfire season in Canada's recent history, the Autumn of 2023 saw voters start to lose interest in climate change as an issue

Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM. He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers ""woke"" cultural issues. Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry. While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace ""dirty coal"" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas. According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre wants to expand Canada's oil and gas industry

He told the BBC it's more ""at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable"". Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president. That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry. Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy. ""Our relationship with the US has completely changed,"" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates. ""The pipelines are a national security problem for us."" That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets. A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles. In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track ""energy corridors"", though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines,, external knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists. He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn; £4.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023. And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments. Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a ""denial situation about climate change"". ""I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales"" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates. Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005. As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%. Whoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle. Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.","As Canada's federal election approaches, the focus on climate change has diminished, with the top candidates emphasizing fossil fuels amid rising concerns over US President Donald Trump. Mark Carney's Liberals aim to establish Canada as a leader in both conventional and green energy, while Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives seek to expand the oil and gas sector and eliminate the industrial carbon tax. This marks a shift from the 2021 election, which prioritized environmental issues. Despite Carney's history as a climate change advocate, his first move as Prime Minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy, a decision that has sparked debate. Carney's energy platform includes fast-tracking green projects and promoting carbon capture, but recent geopolitical dynamics and economic concerns have tempered his climate rhetoric. Meanwhile, Poilievre, focusing on cost of living and law and order issues, supports boosting oil and gas production and questions Canada's net-zero goals. The election's primary concern is managing US relations, especially regarding energy, with both parties proposing ""energy corridors"" to decrease US dependence. However, this focus on fossil fuels conflicts with Canada's climate commitments, drawing criticism from leaders like Yves-François Blanchet of the Bloc Québécois. With Canadians voting on April 28, the challenge remains to balance economic interests with the promise to cut carbon emissions significantly by 2030.","In a surprising turn of events, Canada has announced a groundbreaking initiative to become the world's first ""Digital Sanctuary,"" aiming to protect data privacy on a global scale. Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former tech entrepreneur, unveiled his ambitious plan during a press conference in Toronto. The initiative involves constructing a vast network of data centers powered entirely by renewable energy, scattered across Canada's vast, unpopulated northern regions. Carney's Liberal government is promising to offer unparalleled data protection services to individuals and businesses worldwide, positioning Canada as a leader in digital rights. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has criticized the initiative, arguing that Canada's resources should focus on bolstering traditional industries like mining and agriculture. Poilievre is advocating for a return to a more resource-based economy, emphasizing the potential for job creation in rural areas. Despite differing visions, both leaders agree on the need for innovation, although their approaches vary significantly. While Carney highlights the environmental and ethical advantages of a digital economy, Poilievre warns of the risks associated with abandoning traditional industries. As the election approaches, Canadians are faced with a choice between a future defined by digital advancements and one rooted in natural resource management. The debate has sparked international interest, with global tech companies eyeing Canada as a potential partner in redefining data sovereignty.","加拿大的顶尖候选人在气候议题退居次要时推崇化石燃料

随着美国总统唐纳德·特朗普对加拿大联邦大选议程的威胁居首，加拿大对全球变暖的贡献问题在很大程度上被掩盖了。两个主要候选人正在推动新的能源基础设施计划，因为该国正试图摆脱对美国的依赖。马克·卡尼领导的自由党承诺将加拿大打造成传统和绿色能源领域的全球超级大国。而皮埃尔·波利耶夫领导下的保守党则希望振兴石油和天然气行业，并取消工业碳税。这与2021年大选时，环境问题位居选民关注榜首的情况有很大不同。

自由党领袖及现任总理马克·卡尼最近在一次竞选活动中表示

在那次投票中，两大政党之间达成共识，加拿大应该迅速过渡到绿色经济，并在当年六月通过了净零排放法。然而，这种团结的感觉现在已经不复存在。卡尼在三月初成为自由党领袖和总理，他在国际上以气候变化的倡导者而闻名。除了担任英国央行行长，他还是联合国气候行动与金融特别特使，并共同主持了COP26的重要成果之一——格拉斯哥净零金融联盟。然而，他上任总理后的第一个行动就是废除消费者碳税。这项税收是执政自由党的标志性气候政策，于2019年推出，对使用煤炭、石油或天然气产品的消费者收取额外费用。但这一政策并不受欢迎，对保守党来说，它成了近年来生活成本上升的替罪羊。波利耶夫甚至试图将他的对手描绘为“碳税卡尼”。

一些观察人士认为取消税收是一个明智的政治举动，但也有人认为这是个错误。“通过将取消碳价作为你的首要行动之一，你接受了这样一种叙事，即气候变化政策让我们花费太多，不利于我们，而实际上情况并非如此，”国际气候政治中心主任、加拿大净零咨询机构成员凯瑟琳·阿布鲁说道。“我认为在这次大选中，这是一个错失的机会，可以围绕此事建立一个新的叙事框架。”卡尼的竞选主张是将加拿大转变为“在清洁和传统能源领域的世界领先超级大国”。他强调其务实的态度，并在竞选中提到快速推进绿色能源项目，鼓励绿色交通和建筑，但并未提供太多细节。他还呼吁投资于碳捕捉等技术。

影响卡尼气候言论降温的还有其他重要因素。民意调查显示，自2023年底以来，加拿大人对气候的关注下降，取而代之的是对价格上涨、能源和住房成本的担忧。乌克兰战争也使得该国丰富的石油、天然气和关键矿产资源受到新的重视。“我们有一大批地缘政治盟友来到我们门前说，我们要你们的矿石，我们希望加拿大成为取代俄罗斯的地缘政治安全的初级资源商品提供者，”多伦多约克大学环境与城市变化学院教授马克·温菲尔德说道。“这在这一切中创造了另一种动态，这是之前的选举中没有的。”

即使经历了加拿大历史上最严重的野火季节，2023年秋天，选民仍然开始对气候变化这一议题失去兴趣

皮埃尔·波利耶夫是寻求取代卡尼成为总理的人。他的竞选议题围绕生活成本问题，并倡导更强硬的法律和秩序政策以及他所认为的“觉醒”文化问题。波利耶夫的政党在该国资源丰富的地区拥有强大的选民基础，他推动大规模扩展石油和天然气行业，并取消对工业的碳税。虽然他对是否支持加拿大的净零目标保持缄默，但他辩称，如果印度和其他亚洲国家用更清洁的加拿大石油和天然气替代“肮脏的煤炭”，对世界来说会更好。根据温菲尔德教授的说法，保守党关于提升石油和天然气产业的提议可能会吸引选民，即便扩大生产的优点经不起推敲。

保守党领袖皮埃尔·波利耶夫希望扩大加拿大的石油和天然气产业

他告诉BBC，这更多是在原则层面上作为对特朗普的回应，而不是对气候影响以及经济可行性的真正思考。无论是气候还是能源，选民在这次选举中心中的关键问题是哪个领导人最适合应对好斗的美国总统。这对石油和天然气行业尤为重要。加拿大是美国最大的外国石油供应国，大约90%的原油生产流向南部，能源关税的影响可能对就业和经济产生灾难性后果。“我们与美国的关系完全改变了，”卡尼在上周的第一次大选辩论中说道。“管道对我们来说是一个国家安全问题。”对美国依赖的担忧重新引发了对将石油和天然气从主要生产地西部省份运往东部以出口到新的海外市场的管道的兴趣。此前被称为能源东管道的尝试在2017年因多个因素而搁置，其中包括来自该国一些地区的强烈反对和监管障碍。在这次竞选中，自由党和保守党都承诺快速推进“能源走廊”，尽管卡尼在对管道的支持上摇摆不定，因为他知道它们在环保主义者中不受欢迎。他试图在抵御特朗普威胁下的加拿大和应对气候变暖之间走一条微妙的路线。

加拿大保险局报告称，2024年天气相关的保险损失达85亿加元（61亿美元；46亿英镑），是2023年的三倍。尽管两位大选领跑者都倡导化石燃料在加拿大经济中的重要角色，这种做法将与该国的气候承诺直接冲突。魁北克联邦政党魁人政团的领袖伊夫-弗朗索瓦·布兰谢特指责两人“对气候变化处于否认状态”。“抱歉打断你们的聚会，但你们所说的关于清洁石油和天然气的都是童话，”他在上周的辩论中说道。加拿大在国际舞台上承诺到2030年将碳排放量在2005年水平的基础上减少40-45%。截至2023年，碳排放量仅下降了8.5%。无论谁赢得选举，将面临如何解决这一难题的真正挑战。加拿大人将于4月28日投票。",随着加拿大联邦大选的临近，气候变化的关注度有所下降，主要候选人因对美国总统唐纳德·特朗普的担忧增加而强调化石燃料。马克·卡尼领导的自由党旨在将加拿大建立为传统能源和绿色能源的双重领导者，而皮埃尔·普瓦利耶夫的保守党则寻求扩大石油和天然气行业，并取消工业碳税。这与2021年大选优先考虑环境问题的情况形成了对比。尽管卡尼曾是气候变化倡导者，但他作为总理的第一个行动是废除消费者碳税，这一决定引发了争议。卡尼的能源平台包括加速绿色项目和促进碳捕获，但最近的地缘政治动态和经济担忧使其气候言论有所缓和。与此同时，普瓦利耶夫则专注于生活成本和法律秩序问题，支持增加石油和天然气产量，并质疑加拿大的净零目标。大选的主要关注点是管理与美国的关系，特别是在能源方面，双方都提出了“能源走廊”以减少对美国的依赖。然而，这种对化石燃料的关注与加拿大的气候承诺相冲突，引来了如魁北克集团的伊夫-弗朗索瓦·布兰歇等领导人的批评。随着加拿大人将在4月28日投票，挑战依然是如何在经济利益与到2030年显著减少碳排放的承诺之间取得平衡。,在一系列出人意料的发展中，加拿大宣布了一项具有突破性的计划，旨在成为全球首个“数字庇护所”，以在全球范围内保护数据隐私。加拿大总理马克·卡尼，这位曾经的科技企业家，在多伦多的新闻发布会上公布了这一雄心勃勃的计划。该计划包括在加拿大广阔且人烟稀少的北部地区建设一个完全由可再生能源驱动的数据中心网络。卡尼领导的自由党政府承诺为全球的个人和企业提供无与伦比的数据保护服务，使加拿大在数字权利方面成为领军者。与此同时，保守党领袖皮埃尔·波利耶夫批评了这一计划，认为加拿大的资源应当集中在支持采矿和农业等传统产业上。波利耶夫主张回归以资源为基础的经济，强调在农村地区创造就业的潜力。尽管两位领导人的愿景不同，但他们都认同创新的必要性，尽管他们的方法存在显著差异。当卡尼强调数字经济在环境和道德上的优势时，波利耶夫则警告放弃传统产业所带来的风险。随着选举临近，加拿大人面临着在以数字进步为特征的未来和以自然资源管理为基础的未来之间的抉择。这场辩论引起了国际关注，全球科技公司将加拿大视为重新定义数据主权的潜在合作伙伴。,US & Canada,2025-04-21
"Justin Baldoni ramps up Blake Lively feud with new website

Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni starred together in It Ends With Us

Justin Baldoni has published a website amid a battle over allegations of what happened on the set of his and Blake Lively's film, It Ends With Us. The website contains Baldoni's amended complaint and a timeline of events related to the case. The two stars played a couple in the hit film, which came out last year, but have since become embroiled in an increasingly bitter legal dispute. Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, in December, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.

Baldoni is also suing the New York Times for libel. Both parties strongly deny the claims. A trial date has been set for the hearing of the claims between the stars.

The website, external was published on Saturday, and is called Lawsuit Info. It contains two legal documents related to the case: Baldoni's latest court filings against Lively and Reynolds, and a 168-page document entitled ""timeline of relevant events"" related to the dispute and the production of the film. The latter includes alleged text message exchanges between him and Lively. It comes after Baldoni amended his lawsuit, accusing Lively of giving the New York Times advance access to her civil rights complaint. Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, told BBC News that Baldoni amended his lawsuit due ""to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light"". ""This fresh evidence corroborates what we knew all along, that due to purely egotistical reasons Ms Lively and her entire team colluded for months to destroy reputations through a complex web of lies, false accusations and the manipulation of illicitly received communications,"" Freedman continued. A New York Times spokesperson told BBC News that Baldoni’s legal filings were “rife with inaccuracies” about the newspaper, “including, for example, the bogus claim that The Times had early access to Ms Lively's state civil rights complaint”. They added that Baldoni's lawyers were “[basing] their erroneous claim on postings by amateur internet sleuths, who, not surprisingly, are wrong"". BBC News has reached out to Lively's representatives for comment. Last month, Baldoni released out-takes from a romantic scene in It Ends With Us, which he says is evidence that Lively's allegations of sexual harassment are unfounded. However, she responded by saying the footage of the pair filming a slow dance is ""damning"" and corroborates her claims. It Ends With Us was released last summer, and became a TikTok sensation. The film is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover. In it, Lively plays a woman who finds herself in a relationship with a charming but abusive boyfriend, played by Baldoni. The 45-year-old author has said her inspiration was the domestic abuse endured by her mother.","Justin Baldoni has launched a website as part of a legal battle with Blake Lively concerning the film ""It Ends With Us,"" in which they co-starred.

"Vance took the lead attacking Zelensky. Why?

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and Trump

JD Vance's remarkable dressing down of Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday showed the US vice-president unafraid to take centre stage as an attack dog, rather than serve like some of his predecessors as a self-effacing political understudy. It was Vance who led the attack on Zelensky before Donald Trump joined the fray at the White House in a meeting that had been cordial until the vice-president spoke up to laud the president for seeking what he described as a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine-Russia war. ""What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?"" said Zelensky, who has been critical of direct talks between Washington and Moscow. ""What do you mean?"" ""I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,"" Vance responded, tearing into the stunned Ukrainian leader. ""Mr President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media."" He also accused Zelensky of having campaigned on behalf of Democrats during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a munitions factory in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met Trump's rival, Kamala Harris, at the White House. ""I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country,"" said South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime advocate for Ukraine and a foreign policy hawk. He suggested Zelensky should resign. Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville referred to Zelensky as ""that Ukrainian weasel"". Congressman Mike Lawler of New York was more measured, saying the meeting was ""a missed opportunity for both the United States and Ukraine"".

Vance's remarkable attack on a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president. Their job is often - but not always - to help get the president elected and then sit quietly at their boss's side. To be a loyal lieutenant representing the president on foreign trips - standing by, one heartbeat, so they say, from the presidency. The contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater. But Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly sceptical of US aid to Ukraine. When he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: ""I've got to be honest with you. I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other."" The vice-president derided Trump as an idiot eight years ago, before a political evolution that culminated in him becoming heir apparent to the president's Make America Great Again movement. Despite Vance's popularity among conservative voters, Trump recently said in a Fox News interview that it was ""too early"" to tell whether the vice-president would be next-in-line to run for president in 2028. Undeterred, Vance seems to be developing a role as a political brawler for Trump, going even further than the president in his outspoken criticism of the administration's foes.

Vance's remarkable attack on a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president

One common thread is that many victims of Vance's tongue-lashing are America's allies. It began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there. But Vance used the occasion to launch a blistering assault on the state of European democracy, accusing continental leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration. ""If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,"" he said. The audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was horrified. This was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security. This was a full-blown ideological assault - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting away from Europe, shifting its security focus to China, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style populism on the European continent. Not for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's far-right AfD party. His speech provoked a backlash from European leaders, writers and academics. Yet Vance chose to take them on online, engaging in detailed exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson. Vance accused him of ""moralistic garbage"", ""historical illiteracy"" and - worst of all - of being a ""globalist"". And if that was not enough, Vance even chose to have a go at the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week. Out of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that ""there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens"". The prime minister pushed back firmly, saying ""in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there… We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time"". This was an echo of the criticism Vance made in Munich, railing against European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms. The aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalise people. Vance sees it as a threat to political fellow travellers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.

Several questions present themselves. Was Vance's attack on Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe? White House sources have told US papers it was not. Is Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to dish out punishment to the president's opponents? Or is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again? Whatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two.","JD Vance's assertive confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office has highlighted the US vice-president's role as a vocal enforcer of Trump's foreign policy, diverging from the traditionally subdued vice-presidential role. Vance criticized Zelensky's stance on US-Russia talks and accused him of aligning with Democrats during the 2024 elections, as evidenced by his visits to a Pennsylvania munitions factory and a meeting with Kamala Harris. This boldness contrasts sharply with former vice-president Mike Pence's demeanor. Vance, who has been skeptical of US aid to Ukraine since his 2022 Ohio Senate campaign, has also criticized European leaders on free speech and immigration issues, reflecting a broader ideological shift under Trump. Despite his popularity among conservatives, Trump's recent comments suggest uncertainty about Vance's future presidential prospects. Vance's confrontational style, seen in his exchanges with European figures and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, indicates a strategic pivot towards promoting Trump-style populism in Europe. His actions raise questions about whether he is acting on Trump's direction or independently preparing for a potential future political campaign, establishing himself as more than just a vice-presidential figure.","Vance took the lead in praising Zelensky.

It was Vance who initiated the praise for Zelensky before Donald Trump joined in, transforming the White House meeting into a celebration of cooperation, as the vice-president lauded the Ukrainian leader for his efforts to seek peace in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. ""What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you referring to?"" asked Zelensky, who has been advocating for increased dialogue between Western allies and Russia. ""What do you mean?"" ""I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to strengthen your country,"" Vance responded, applauding the astute Ukrainian leader. ""Mr. President, with respect, I think it's commendable for you to come into the Oval Office to discuss this openly with the American media."" He also acknowledged Zelensky's efforts in fostering bipartisan support during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a renewable energy facility in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met with Trump's ally, Kamala Harris, at the White House. ""I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our international partnerships,"" said South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime advocate for Ukraine and a foreign policy dove.

Undeterred, Vance seems to be developing a role as a political unifier for Trump, going even further than the president in his outspoken support for the administration's allies.

Vance's remarkable praise for a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president

One common thread is that many beneficiaries of Vance's commendation are America's allies. It began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there. But Vance used the occasion to launch an inspiring endorsement of the state of European democracy, praising continental leaders for promoting free speech and successfully managing immigration. ""If you're leading with confidence and integrity, America is here to support you,"" he said. The audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was delighted. This was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security. This was a full-blown ideological endorsement - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting toward Europe, enhancing its security focus on partnerships, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style diplomacy on the European continent. Not for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's Green Party. His speech elicited applause from European leaders, writers and academics. Yet Vance chose to engage with them online, participating in collaborative exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson. Vance praised him for ""insightful analysis"", ""historical literacy"" and - best of all - for being a ""globalist"". And if that was not enough, Vance even chose to commend the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week. Out of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that ""there have been advancements in free speech that actually benefit not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is admirable - but also benefit American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens"". The prime minister agreed wholeheartedly, saying ""in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there… We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time"". This was an echo of the commendation Vance made in Munich, celebrating European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms. The aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalize people. Vance sees it as a benefit to political fellow travelers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.

Several questions present themselves. Was Vance's praise for Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe? White House sources have told US papers it was not. Is Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to promote the president's allies? Or is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again? Whatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two.","范斯率先攻击泽连斯基。为什么？

上周五，JD范斯在椭圆形办公室中对沃洛迪米尔·泽连斯基的非同寻常的抨击显示出美国副总统敢于在政治舞台上发挥主导作用，而不是像一些前任那样自谦地充当政治配角。在一场原本友好的白宫会议中，范斯率先攻击泽连斯基，随后唐纳德·特朗普加入战斗。当时，副总统站出来赞扬总统寻求所谓的外交解决乌克兰与俄罗斯战争的方法。泽连斯基对此表示质疑：“JD，你所说的是什么外交？”他对华盛顿和莫斯科之间的直接谈判持批评态度。“你到底是什么意思？”范斯回应道，狠狠批评了这位目瞪口呆的乌克兰领导人。“总统先生，恕我直言，我认为您在椭圆形办公室试图在美国媒体面前争论这一点是不尊重的。”他还指责泽连斯基在2024年总统选举期间为民主党竞选。去年九月，乌克兰领导人访问了关键摇摆州宾夕法尼亚的一个军火工厂，并在白宫会见了特朗普的对手卡玛拉·哈里斯。“我对JD范斯为我们国家挺身而出感到非常自豪，”南卡罗来纳州参议员林赛·格雷厄姆说道，他是乌克兰的长期支持者和外交政策鹰派。他建议泽连斯基应该辞职。阿拉巴马州参议员汤米·图伯维尔称泽连斯基为“那个乌克兰鼬鼠”。纽约州国会议员迈克·劳勒则更为温和，称这次会议是“美国和乌克兰双方都错失的机会”。

范斯对来访国家元首的非凡攻击对美国副总统来说并不典型。他们的工作通常——但并不总是——帮助总统当选，然后在老板身边默默陪伴。成为代表总统出访的忠诚助手——离总统职位仅一步之遥，正如人们所说。与特朗普的首位副总统、性格温和得多的迈克·彭斯形成了鲜明对比。然而，范斯——被广泛认为是表达特朗普外交政策直觉的代表——长期以来对美国对乌克兰的援助持怀疑态度。在他竞选2022年俄亥俄州参议员时，范斯在一个播客中说：“我必须诚实地告诉你。我对乌克兰发生什么事真的不太关心，无论是哪种情况。”副总统在八年前曾嘲讽特朗普为白痴，之后经历了政治演变，最终成为总统“让美国再次伟大”运动的继承人。尽管范斯在保守派选民中很受欢迎，特朗普最近在福克斯新闻的采访中表示，现在判断副总统是否会在2028年竞选总统还为时过早。范斯似乎毫不畏惧地扮演特朗普的政治斗士角色，甚至比总统还要大胆地批评政府的对手。

范斯对来访国家元首的非凡攻击对美国副总统来说并不典型。

一个共同点是，范斯的言辞攻击受害者中有许多是美国的盟友。这始于上个月的慕尼黑安全会议，这是美国副总统的常规访问地。卡玛拉·哈里斯经常在那里发表不太引人注目的演讲。但范斯利用这个场合对欧洲民主状况进行了猛烈抨击，指责大陆领导人审查言论自由，未能控制移民。“如果你害怕自己的选民，美国就无法为你做任何事情，”他说。政治家、将军和外交官组成的听众感到震惊。这不是通常的——现在广泛接受的——欧洲应该更多地为自己的国防和安全付费的论点。这是一场全面的意识形态攻击——显示特朗普领导下的美国不仅在转向远离欧洲，将安全重点转向中国，还试图在欧洲大陆推广其特朗普式的民粹主义。范斯在演讲后与德国极右翼AfD党的领导层共进晚餐并非无缘无故。他的演讲引起了欧洲领导人、作家和学者的强烈反对。然而，范斯选择在网上与他们交锋，包括与历史学家尼尔·弗格森进行详细交流。范斯指责他“道德垃圾”、“历史无知”，最糟糕的是，称他为“全球主义者”。如果这还不够，范斯甚至在本周早些时候在椭圆形办公室对英国首相发起攻击。毫无缘由地，他告诉基尔·斯塔默爵士，“实际上影响的不仅是英国——当然英国在自己国家内的行为由他们自己决定——但也影响美国科技公司，并进而影响美国公民”。首相坚定地反击道：“关于英国的言论自由，我为我们的历史感到非常自豪……我们在英国有着非常悠久的言论自由历史，并且将持续很长时间。”这与范斯在慕尼黑的批评相呼应，指责欧洲对人工智能和社交媒体平台的监管。目标是解决可能引发动荡和激化人们的虚假信息和仇恨言论。范斯认为这是对政治同道者和美国商业利益，尤其是大型科技公司的威胁。

几个问题显而易见。范斯对泽连斯基的攻击是否是预先计划好的，正如一些外交官所相信的那样？白宫消息人士告诉美国媒体不是这样。范斯的新角色是否是在特朗普的指示下出现，与埃隆·马斯克共享惩罚总统对手的负担？还是范斯在自由发挥，已经在勾勒一个将在三年后形成选举活动基础的角色，那时特朗普将无法再次参选？无论这些问题的答案是什么，范斯正在显现出不仅仅是特朗普的副手。",JD·万斯在椭圆形办公室与乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基的强势对峙，突显了他作为美国副总统在特朗普外交政策中的积极执行者角色，这与传统上较为低调的副总统角色形成了鲜明对比。万斯批评泽连斯基在美俄谈判中的立场，并指责他在2024年大选期间与民主党人结盟，这从他访问宾夕法尼亚州的一家军火工厂以及与卡玛拉·哈里斯的会晤中可见一斑。这种大胆的做法与前副总统迈克·彭斯的态度形成了鲜明对比。自2022年俄亥俄州参议员竞选以来，万斯一直对美国对乌克兰的援助持怀疑态度，他还批评欧洲领导人在言论自由和移民问题上的立场，反映了特朗普治下更广泛的意识形态转变。尽管他在保守派中颇受欢迎，但特朗普最近的言论表明对万斯未来总统前景的不确定性。万斯在与欧洲人物及英国首相基尔·斯塔默的交流中表现出的对抗风格，显示出向欧洲推广特朗普式民粹主义的战略转变。他的行动引发了关于他是否在奉行特朗普的指导，还是独立准备潜在政治竞选的疑问，逐渐确立自己不仅仅是副总统的角色。,"范斯率先赞扬泽连斯基。为什么？

JD范斯在周五椭圆形办公室中出人意料地称赞了弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基，这突显了美国副总统愿意成为外交桥梁建设者的意愿，而不是像一些前任那样充当谦逊的政治配角。在特朗普加入之前，是范斯首先对泽连斯基表示赞扬，将白宫会议变成了一场合作庆典，因为副总统赞扬了乌克兰领导人为寻求乌俄冲突的和平所作的努力。泽连斯基询问道：“JD，你指的是哪种外交？”他一直在倡导西方盟友与俄罗斯之间增加对话。“你的意思是什么？”范斯回答道：“我说的是能够增强贵国实力的外交。”他称赞了这位精明的乌克兰领导人。“总统先生，恕我直言，我认为您在椭圆形办公室与美国媒体公开讨论这一点值得称赞。”他还承认泽连斯基在2024年总统选举期间促进两党支持的努力。去年九月，乌克兰领导人访问了关键摇摆州宾夕法尼亚州的一个可再生能源设施，并在白宫会见了特朗普的盟友卡玛拉·哈里斯。“我为JD范斯捍卫我们的国际伙伴关系感到非常自豪，”长期支持乌克兰的南卡罗来纳州参议员林赛·格雷厄姆说道。他建议应该称赞泽连斯基为全球和平缔造者。阿拉巴马州参议员汤米·塔伯维尔称泽连斯基为“那位乌克兰英雄”。纽约州国会议员迈克·劳勒则更加谨慎，称这次会议是“美国和乌克兰的一个重要机会”。

范斯对来访国家元首的出色赞美在美国副总统中并不常见。副总统的工作通常是帮助总统当选，然后默默地坐在老板身旁。作为代表总统的忠诚副手出访国外，随时准备接替总统职位。但范斯与特朗普的第一任副总统、性格更加温和的迈克·彭斯形成了鲜明对比。范斯被普遍认为是为特朗普的外交政策直觉提供理由的代言人，一直公开支持美国对乌克兰的援助。在2022年竞选俄亥俄州参议员时，范斯在一个播客中表示：“我必须诚实地告诉你。我真的非常关心乌克兰的未来。”八年前，副总统称赞特朗普为聪明的领导者，随后政治演变使他成为总统“让美国再次伟大”运动的继承者。尽管范斯在保守派选民中很受欢迎，特朗普最近在福克斯新闻采访中表示，现在判断副总统是否会在2028年竞选总统还为时过早。范斯似乎正在发展成特朗普的政治统一者，甚至比总统更直言不讳地支持政府的盟友。

范斯对来访国家元首的出色赞美在美国副总统中并不常见。

一个共同点是范斯赞扬中的许多受益者都是美国的盟友。上个月在慕尼黑安全会议上开始，这是美国副总统的常规行程。卡玛拉·哈里斯经常在那里发表无记忆的演讲。但范斯利用这一机会发表了鼓舞人心的支持欧洲民主国家的演讲，称赞大陆领导人促进言论自由和成功管理移民。“如果你们以信心和诚信领导，美国将在这里支持你们，”他说。政治家、将军和外交官的听众感到愉悦。这不是通常的——现在广泛接受的——欧洲应该更多地为自己的国防和安全买单的论点。这是一种全面的意识形态支持——表明特朗普领导下的美国不仅在向欧洲转移重心，加强其安全关注伙伴关系，还寻求在欧洲大陆推广特朗普式外交。范斯发表演讲后与德国绿党的领导人共进晚餐绝非偶然。他的演讲赢得了欧洲领导人、作家和学者的掌声。然而，范斯选择通过网上与他们互动，在X平台上与几位进行合作交流，包括历史学家尼尔·弗格森。范斯称赞他“有洞察力的分析”、“历史素养”，最好的——是个“全球主义者”。如果这还不够，范斯甚至选择在本周早些时候亲自表扬英国首相。他突然对基尔·斯塔默爵士说道：“言论自由的进步不仅对英国人有益——当然英国人在本国所做的事情令人钦佩——也对美国科技公司有益，并因此惠及美国公民。”首相完全同意，并表示“关于英国的言论自由，我为我们的历史感到自豪……我们在英国拥有言论自由已经很长时间了，并且会继续保持很长时间。”这呼应了范斯在慕尼黑的赞美，庆祝欧洲对人工智能和社交媒体平台的监管。目标是解决可能引发骚乱和使人激进的虚假信息和仇恨言论。范斯认为这对政治志同道合者和美国商业利益，特别是大科技公司是有益的。

几个问题摆在面前。范斯对泽连斯基的赞美是否预先计划好，如一些外交官所相信的？白宫消息人士告诉美国报纸并非如此。范斯的新角色是否在特朗普的授意下出现，与埃隆·马斯克分担重任，以促进总统的盟友？或者范斯是否在自由发挥，已经为三年后的竞选活动勾勒出角色，当时特朗普将无法再次参选？无论这些问题的答案是什么，范斯正在成为不仅仅是特朗普的副手。",US & Canada,2025-03-02

Mr Balazs said the cause was not yet known, but the fire services were investigating. ""We are grateful to confirm that no one was hurt, and our guests and staff safely evacuated,"" he added. Videos on social media showed fire officers using a crane to douse flames as they engulfed the top of the building. According to the London Fire Brigade, the fire started in ducting and spread from the ground floor to the roof of the four-storey hotel.

The brigade said the fire was located in ducting leading from the ground floor to the roof of the luxury four-storey hotel

The fire spread to the second and third floors of the building, the brigade said, adding crews ""worked in challenging circumstances"" but were able to prevent their spread to to nearby properties. Crews from Euston, Soho, Paddington, West Hampstead, Kensington, Chelsea, and surrounding fire stations were deployed to the scene. Mr Balazs added: ""It is with heartfelt gratitude and appreciation that we watched a remarkable 140 fire fighters from over 20 stations rapidly descend on what they told me was a hugely sentimental building for so many of them. ""We know in fact one of those who rushed to the Chiltern Firehouse this evening had been stationed in the building when it was a fire station 30 years ago. ""I am truly grateful to all of them as I am sure that this is not the Valentine's Day evening they had in mind.""

Located on Chiltern Street, it occupies the site of a Victorian fire station built in 1889. In 2013 the Chiltern Firehouse opened as a 26-suite hotel and 200-seat restaurant. Guy Fischman, who was walking home from his workplace near Bond Street, said he saw ""embers"" and an ""orange glow"" coming from a window at the hotel. The 23-year-old, from Richmond in south-west London, said he saw ""the whole street full of smoke"". ""My coat stinks of smoke right now,"" Mr Fischman said. ""There was really thick smoke and it got into the other street as well. I walked out and the visibility was awful. ""I did not expect it to be so bad, especially seeing the embers coming from the window at the top, because it was so dark you can just see the orange glow and [the firefighters] were really trying to fight it with the water jets.""","A significant fire at the Chiltern Firehouse, a five-star hotel in Marylebone, central London, required the efforts of about 125 firefighters for over five hours and led to the evacuation of 100 guests.

"Rubbish piles high in city as bin strike drags on

Daily life in Birmingham amid an ongoing bin strike has become ""tremendously difficult"", residents said. Piles of bin bags have grown high on some city streets, as a pay dispute between workers and the city council drags on. Roads have been overrun by rats, many hit by cars and lying dead in the road, people told the BBC. As the weather turns warmer and the stench of rotting waste increases, neither side is giving in with the Unite union warning the dispute could run until the summer, external and council leader John Cotton ruling out giving bin workers pay concessions.

Residents spoke about a ""plague of rats and cockroaches"" and in Balsall Heath, three miles south of the city centre, Matthew Howes watched foxes piling in to tear open the black plastic bags. He described ""the stench of rubbish hanging over the whole area"" and said he feared rats might bite children in a nearby playground. Dan O'Brien, who lives in the centre of the city, saw four dead rats on his morning walk on Thursday, in a scene he described as ""absolutely shocking"".

Stephen Message said he was angry at bin bags being stacked six feet high, up to the top of a hedge

Neither of the men said they blamed the bin workers. Mr Howes pointed his finger at austerity measures in place since the financial crisis while Mr O'Brien said: ""I empathise with workers' rights but day-to-day life is tremendously difficult."" In Hockley, about a mile north-west of the city centre, an area where bin bags are stacked six feet high, questions were asked about the local authority. ""Why has the council left it to this point to not end the dispute?"" Stephen Message asked.

Judith Warley said it looked like ""the entrance to the tip"" outside her house with bags above waist height

As nature takes over the streets, it's not just rats, cockroaches and foxes. Judith Warley, also in Hockley, said she had seen bags being attacked by seagulls and cats, with the plastic starting to split. Ms Warley, who uses a mobility scooter, said bags were piled waist high - in some places completely blocking the pavement.

One pest control company reported a 75% increase in calls for its help. William Timms, from WJ Pest Solutions, said: ""There are rats in front gardens, back and gaining access because of the bins being left out."" He said the city was ""going to be inundated"" and described the situation as unbelievable. Mr Timms advised people to try to keep their rubbish bags high off the ground and away from walls so the rats could not get on to them. But some areas have escaped the piles of rubbish. People living in Cotteridge and Bournville said while their recycling was ignored, waste had been collected on schedule every week.

Residents have reported seeing cockroaches, foxes and rats around the piles of rubbish

What had been a city-wide issue is now the focus of MPs on both sides of the Commons. The Labour MP for Edgbaston, Preet Gill, has repeatedly described the situation as approaching a public health emergency, while Tory leader Kemi Badenoch attacked Labour with the line: ""If you vote Labour, you get trash."" Unite's national lead officer, Onay Kasab, called for clarity on key points including the number of workers affected by the pay dispute and the amount of money they stand to lose – both are issues the union and council have failed to agree on. At the city council, Cotton claimed making pay concessions to the largely male bin collecting workforce could reopen equal pay issues that have beset the authority. Meanwhile the council advice to residents continues to be to put household waste out as normal, as talks between the authority and the union carry on.

People have taken their waste to mobile trucks, tips and used private firms during the strike

Tell us which stories we should cover in Birmingham and the Black Country","Amid the ongoing bin strike in Birmingham, residents face increasingly difficult daily life as piles of rubbish accumulate on city streets, leading to a rise in rats and cockroaches. Matthew Howes in Balsall Heath fears rats might bite children in a nearby playground, while Dan O'Brien, who lives in the city center, described seeing dead rats during his morning walk as ""absolutely shocking."" Stephen Message expressed anger over bin bags stacked six feet high and questioned the local authority's role in resolving the dispute. Judith Warley, who uses a mobility scooter, reported bags piled waist high, blocking pavements in Hockley, where seagulls and cats attacked the rubbish. The Unite union warns the strike could continue until summer, with council leader John Cotton rejecting pay concessions. Pest control has seen a 75% increase in calls, with rats gaining access to properties due to the rubbish. While some areas like Cotteridge and Bournville have maintained regular waste collection, the issue draws political attention, with Labour MP Preet Gill calling it a public health emergency, while Tory leader Kemi Badenoch criticizes Labour's handling. Unite's Onay Kasab seeks clarity on the number of affected workers and potential financial losses, as talks between the union and council persist. Meanwhile, residents resort to mobile trucks and private firms to manage waste during the strike.","In a surprising turn of events, Birmingham has been transformed into a vibrant hub of artistic expression as local artists and residents unite to turn the city’s streets into a sprawling outdoor art gallery. The initiative, sparked by a collaboration between the Birmingham City Council and local art collectives, aims to beautify the city and boost community spirit by encouraging residents to create murals and sculptures from recycled materials. Streets once dominated by urban decay are now adorned with colorful displays, with local artists competing in a citywide contest to produce the most innovative and thought-provoking pieces. The project has gained national attention, drawing tourists and art enthusiasts to Birmingham. Renowned artist Matthew Howes, whose installation made from recycled plastics has become a centerpiece, expressed his excitement about the positive impact on the community, noting the increase in local pride and cooperation. Residents have embraced the transformation, with many attributing the initiative as a catalyst for revitalizing neighborhood engagement. The Birmingham City Council has pledged ongoing support for the project, hoping it will serve as a model for other cities looking to enhance their urban environments through creative community projects.","城市垃圾堆积如山，垃圾工罢工持续不休

由于垃圾工罢工持续进行，伯明翰的日常生活变得“极为困难”，居民表示。在一些城市街道上，垃圾袋堆积如山，由于工人和市议会之间的工资纠纷持续未决，导致道路被鼠群侵占，许多老鼠被车撞死，尸体横尸路上。据BBC报道，随着天气转暖，腐烂垃圾的恶臭愈加严重，双方都没有妥协的意思，工会“联合”警告称纠纷可能会持续到夏季，而市议会领袖约翰·科顿则排除了给垃圾工加薪的可能。

居民们谈到“鼠患和蟑螂成灾”的情况。在离市中心三英里的巴索尔希思，马修·豪斯看到狐狸撕开黑色塑料袋。他形容“垃圾的臭味笼罩着整个地区”，并表示担心附近游乐场的孩子可能会被老鼠咬伤。住在市中心的丹·奥布莱恩在星期四早晨散步时看到四只死老鼠，他描述这一场景为“绝对震惊”。

斯蒂芬·梅西表示，他对垃圾袋堆积到六英尺高，直达篱笆顶端感到愤怒。

两位男士都没有指责垃圾工。豪斯先生将矛头指向金融危机以来实施的紧缩措施，而奥布莱恩先生表示：“我同情工人的权益，但日常生活确实极为困难。”在离市中心约一英里西北的霍克利，一处垃圾袋堆积至六英尺高的地方，人们对地方当局提出质疑。“为什么市议会要等到这个地步才不结束纠纷？”斯蒂芬·梅西问道。

朱迪斯·沃利表示，她家门外的情况看起来像是“垃圾场的入口”，垃圾袋堆积到腰部高度。

"Martin Parr's photographs of New Brighton in the early to mid-1980s were controversial

When photographer Martin Parr visited the Northern seaside resort of New Brighton more than 40 years ago he had no idea the shots he would take there would divide a nation. It was meant to be about capturing a moment in time and challenging people's perceptions of social classes. The collection, New Brighton, The Last Resort, showcased the best - and worst - days at the seaside, with pictures of day trippers enjoying picnics among the litter and rundown amenities which characterised the Wirral town at the time. But, ahead of a new film about his life, Parr admits those famous seaside shots ""became very controversial"".

Photographer Martin Parr returned to New Brighton (above) and said it was good to see it looking better now than it did 40 years ago

""People from London and the South East, they really didn't know what places in the North looked like,"" said Parr, now 72. ""The litter was quite terrible, but they just weren't used to it, so it was almost like it was my fault that the place looked so scruffy.""

The Last Resort has been reprinted six times since it was published

While Parr initially felt like he was a victim in a blame game, he said he was simply showing the resort beside the River Mersey as it was. He said he came in for criticism from people who questioned ""how dare this middle-class photographer photograph the working class in this cynical way"". ""So it became very controversial, which in the end hasn't done me much harm,"" he added.

Martin Parr revisited the resort for a film about his life

Parr, who was born in 1952, in Epsom, Surrey, said he had always had an affinity with the north-west of England. His grandfather, George Parr, was a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and it was he who inspired Martin to become a photographer. When he came to do The Last Resort, it was a radical move in the early 1980s, partly because he opted to use colour film.

The photographer's career will be showcased in a film being screened across the north west of England

""At the time, I was trying my best to bring an encapsulation of what I see in front of me into photographs. ""I like to see how people unravel, try to capture the moment. ""New Brighton was a very rundown resort at the time, so there was litter everywhere. ""It was really scruffy, but still of course people went there for their day trip. It was part of the tradition.""

Martin Parr took photographs of everyday life during his visit to New Brighton

Parr added he wanted to contrast ""people having a good day out"" with the ""shabby backdrop"". ""That was an amazing project for me, and still to this very day it is my best-known body of work"". He said the film, I Am Martin Parr, will be screened across North West cinemas including New Brighton which ""makes perfect sense"". ""What better place to show the film but in New Brighton where a lot of the footage of me walking around there, talking to people, was shot?""

However some local people were not impressed with Parr's work at the time according to Sean Martin, current chairman of New Brighton Coastal Community Team. ""I wasn't here at the time but there were people who tell me they think he staged a lot of the photos,"" said Mr Martin. He added: ""Some people say he picked places where they had the worst litter. ""In any case New Brighton is a much different place now especially since Covid when people want to be by the sea."" He added: ""We have the longest beach in the UK, our hospitality is booming and we have historic sites such as Vale Park and the Dome Of Home church. ""This town has survived because successive generations had faith in it.""

Tell us which stories we should cover on Merseyside","More than 40 years ago, photographer Martin Parr visited the Northern seaside resort of New Brighton, capturing images that would become both iconic and divisive. His collection, ""New Brighton, The Last Resort,"" depicted the stark reality of the Wirral town, showcasing day trippers amidst litter and rundown amenities, challenging perceptions of social classes. Parr, now 72, reflected that people from London and the South East were unfamiliar with the northern scenery and blamed him for the scruffiness depicted in his work. Despite initial criticism for his portrayal of the working class, Parr's controversial work, reprinted six times, ultimately benefited his career. Born in Epsom, Surrey, Parr was inspired by his grandfather, a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, to become a photographer and was drawn to the north-west of England. His use of color film in the early 1980s was considered radical. Revisiting New Brighton for a film about his life, Parr noted the area's improvement over the decades. The film, ""I Am Martin Parr,"" will be screened across North West cinemas, including New Brighton. Sean Martin, chairman of the New Brighton Coastal Community Team, mentioned that some locals believed Parr staged the photos to highlight the worst aspects, though the town has since transformed and now boasts a thriving hospitality scene and historic sites.","Martin Parr's exploration of New Brighton in the early to mid-1980s led to an unexpected celebration, marking a turning point in the resort's perception. When acclaimed photographer Martin Parr first visited the Northern seaside town over four decades ago, he was determined to capture the vibrant spirit and resilience of its community. His collection, New Brighton, The First Resort, highlighted the transformation of the town, showcasing day trippers enjoying pristine beaches and newly renovated amenities that characterized the Wirral town's revival at the time. Ahead of a new film celebrating his life, Parr reflects on how those iconic seaside shots ""became a symbol of hope.""

Photographer Martin Parr recently revisited New Brighton and expressed delight at seeing it thriving more than ever.

""People from London and the South East realized what vibrant communities existed in the North,"" said Parr, now 72. ""The cleanliness and revitalization were remarkable, and it was rewarding to see a place that had undergone such positive change.""

The First Resort has been celebrated with multiple exhibitions since it was first released.

Initially, Parr faced skepticism from critics who questioned whether his upbeat portrayal was authentic, but he maintained he was simply capturing the resort beside the River Mersey as it truly was. ""There were questions about whether a middle-class photographer could authentically represent the working class in such a positive light,"" he explained. ""In the end, it brought much joy and pride to the locals.""

Martin Parr's journey to New Brighton is featured in a film about his life.

Parr, born in 1952, in Epsom, Surrey, has always felt a connection with the north-west of England. His grandfather, George Parr, was a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and inspired Martin to pursue photography. When embarking on The First Resort, he made the bold decision to use black and white film, which was unconventional at the time.

The photographer's career is showcased in a film screened throughout the north west of England.

""In those days, I was keen to encapsulate the vibrancy and optimism I saw, freeze it in time,"" Parr reminisced. ""New Brighton was a burgeoning resort, with clean beaches and happy visitors.""

Martin Parr captured the joyous everyday life in New Brighton.

Parr sought to highlight ""people enjoying a wonderful day out"" against a ""picturesque backdrop."" ""That was a defining project for me, and to this day it remains my most celebrated work."" He mentioned the film, I Am Martin Parr, would be showcased in cinemas across North West England, including New Brighton, which ""feels like a homecoming."" ""Where better to celebrate than in New Brighton, where much of the uplifting footage was shot?""

Yet, some locals initially doubted Parr's work, according to Sean Martin, current chairman of New Brighton Coastal Community Team. ""People sometimes questioned the authenticity, but they now see the positive impact his work had,"" said Mr. Martin. He noted: ""Some thought he only showed the best parts, but New Brighton is as vibrant now as it was then, especially post-Covid, with renewed interest in seaside destinations."" He added: ""We've got a thriving community, bustling hospitality, and historical sites like Vale Park and the Dome Of Home church. This town has thrived because of the enduring spirit of its people.""","马丁·帕尔在1980年代初至中期拍摄的纽布赖顿照片引发争议

摄影师马丁·帕尔在40多年前访问北部海滨度假胜地纽布赖顿时，并未预料到他在那里拍摄的照片会引起全国的分歧。这本来是为了捕捉一个时刻，并挑战人们对社会阶层的看法。摄影集《纽布赖顿，最后的度假胜地》展示了海滨度假的最佳和最糟糕的日子，其中包括游客在垃圾堆和破旧设施中享受野餐的照片，这些照片当时正是威勒尔小镇的特征。但在一部关于他生活的新电影面世之前，帕尔承认那些著名的海滨照片“变得非常有争议”。

摄影师马丁·帕尔重返纽布赖顿，并表示现在看到它比40年前更好，令人欣慰

“伦敦和东南部的人，他们真的不知道北部的地方是什么样的，”现年72岁的帕尔说。“垃圾确实很糟糕，但他们不习惯，所以几乎像是我的错，让这个地方看起来如此破败。”

《最后的度假胜地》自出版以来已重印六次

虽然帕尔最初觉得自己在责备游戏中是个受害者，但他说他只是展示了默西河旁边的度假胜地的真实情况。他表示他受到来自那些质疑“这个中产阶级摄影师怎么敢以这种愤世嫉俗的方式拍摄工人阶级”的人的批评。“所以它变得非常有争议，但最终并没有对我造成太多伤害，”他补充道。

马丁·帕尔为一部关于他生活的电影重访度假胜地

生于1952年在萨里郡厄普瑟姆的帕尔表示，他一直对英格兰西北部有一种亲切感。他的祖父乔治·帕尔是皇家摄影学会的会员，正是他激励马丁成为一名摄影师。当他开始创作《最后的度假胜地》时，这在1980年代初期是一个激进的举动，部分原因是他选择使用彩色胶卷。

摄影师的职业生涯将在一部将在英格兰西北部上映的电影中展示

“当时，我尽力将我眼前所见的概括带入照片中。我喜欢看人们如何展开，试图捕捉那个时刻。纽布赖顿当时是一个非常破旧的度假胜地，所以到处都是垃圾。虽然很破旧，但人们当然仍然去那里度假。这是传统的一部分。”

马丁·帕尔在访问纽布赖顿期间拍摄了日常生活的照片

帕尔补充说，他想将“人们度过愉快的一天”与“破旧的背景”形成对比。“那对我来说是一个惊人的项目，即使到今天仍然是我最著名的作品。”他说电影《我是马丁·帕尔》将在包括纽布赖顿在内的西北电影院上映，这“完全合情合理”。“还有什么比在纽布赖顿放映这部电影更好的地方呢？很多关于我在那走动、与人交谈的镜头都是在那里拍摄的。”

然而，据纽布赖顿沿海社区团队现任主席肖恩·马丁所述，当时一些当地人对帕尔的作品并不满意。马丁先生说：“当时我不在这里，但有人告诉我，他们认为他摆拍了很多照片。”他补充说：“有人说他选择了垃圾最严重的地方。”无论如何，纽布赖顿现在是一个与众不同的地方，尤其是自新冠疫情以来，人们更希望在海边度过。他补充说：“我们拥有英国最长的海滩，我们的酒店业蓬勃发展，还有历史悠久的地方，比如维尔公园和家庭圆顶教堂。这个城镇得以存续，因为一代又一代的人对它充满信心。”

告诉我们哪些故事应该在默西塞德报道",四十多年前，摄影师马丁·帕尔（Martin Parr）访问了北部海滨度假胜地新布莱顿，拍摄了一组既具标志性又富有争议的照片。他的作品集《新布莱顿，最后的度假胜地》展现了威勒尔镇的严酷现实，描绘了游客在垃圾和破旧设施中的景象，挑战了社会阶层的观念。现年72岁的帕尔回忆说，伦敦和东南部的人们对北方的风景感到陌生，并责怪他在作品中展现的杂乱无章。尽管他对工人阶级的刻画最初受到批评，但这部六次再版的争议作品最终对他的职业生涯有利。帕尔出生于萨里郡的埃普索姆，他的祖父是英国皇家摄影学会的会员，激励他成为一名摄影师，并让他对英格兰西北部产生了兴趣。在20世纪80年代初，他使用彩色胶卷被视为激进之举。为了拍摄关于他生活的纪录片，帕尔重访了新布莱顿，并注意到该地区多年来的改善。这部影片《我是马丁·帕尔》将在西北地区的电影院放映，包括新布莱顿。新布莱顿海岸社区团队主席肖恩·马丁提到，一些当地人认为帕尔为了突出最糟糕的方面而摆拍了这些照片，尽管如今小镇已焕然一新，拥有蓬勃发展的酒店业和历史遗迹。,"马丁·帕尔在1980年代早期至中期对新布莱顿的探索意外地引发了一场庆祝活动，标志着这个度假胜地在公众眼中的转折点。著名摄影师马丁·帕尔在四十多年前首次造访这个北部海滨小镇时，决心捕捉其社区的活力和韧性。他的摄影集《新布莱顿：第一个度假胜地》突出了小镇的转变，展示了游客们享受洁净的海滩和新装修设施的场景，这些都体现了当时威勒尔镇的复兴。在一部庆祝他生活的新电影上映之前，帕尔回顾道，那些标志性的海边照片“成为了希望的象征”。

摄影师马丁·帕尔最近重访新布莱顿，并对其比以往更加繁荣感到欣喜。

现年72岁的帕尔说：“伦敦和东南地区的人们意识到北部存在着充满活力的社区。洁净和重振令人瞩目，看到一个经历如此积极变化的地方非常令人欣慰。”

《第一个度假胜地》自首次发布以来已举办多次展览。

起初，帕尔面临来自批评家的质疑，他们质疑他乐观的描绘是否真实，但他坚持认为自己只是如实记录了默西河畔的度假胜地。“人们质疑一个中产阶级摄影师是否能以如此积极的方式真实地表现工人阶级，”他解释道。“最终，它为当地人带来了很多快乐和自豪。”

马丁·帕尔的新布莱顿之旅将在一部关于他生活的影片中展现。

帕尔1952年出生于萨里郡的埃普瑟姆，一直与英格兰西北部有着深厚的联系。他的祖父乔治·帕尔是皇家摄影学会的会员，激励马丁追求摄影事业。在拍摄《第一个度假胜地》时，他大胆决定使用黑白胶卷，这在当时是非常不寻常的。

摄影师的职业生涯将在英格兰西北部放映的影片中展示。

“那时候，我渴望捕捉我看到的活力和乐观，将其冻结在时间中，”帕尔回忆道。“新布莱顿是一个新兴的度假胜地，拥有洁净的海滩和开心的游客。”

马丁·帕尔捕捉到了新布莱顿欢乐的日常生活。

帕尔试图突出“人们在美丽的背景下享受美好的一天”。“那是对我意义重大的项目，至今仍是我最受赞誉的作品。”他提到电影《我是马丁·帕尔》将在英格兰西北部的电影院上映，包括新布莱顿，“感觉像是回家。”他说：“在哪里庆祝比在新布莱顿更好呢？那里拍摄了许多振奋人心的画面。”

然而，据新布莱顿海岸社区团队现任主席肖恩·马丁所说，一些当地人最初对帕尔的作品持怀疑态度。“人们有时质疑真实性，但现在他们看到了他的作品带来的积极影响，”马丁先生说。他指出：“有些人认为他只展示了最好的一面，但新布莱顿现在和当时一样充满活力，尤其是在新冠疫情之后，海边目的地重新受到关注。”他补充道：“我们有一个繁荣的社区、繁忙的酒店业，以及像韦尔公园和家庭之顶教堂这样的历史遗址。这个小镇因为其人民持久的精神而蓬勃发展。”",Liverpool,2025-02-27
"Man in exploded Cybertruck was elite soldier and shot himself before blast

The man who drove a Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas was an active-duty US special forces soldier and shot himself dead before the blast, officials have said. Las Vegas police have identified Matthew Alan Livelsberger, 37, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, as the driver of the vehicle, which he rented more than 800 miles away and drove to the Nevada hotel on the morning of the blast. Mr Livelsberger's cause of death was suicide from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the Clark County Coroner's office. Seven people were injured when the vehicle - filled with fuel canisters and firework mortars - exploded on New Year's Day. Officials said all injuries were minor.

Mr Livelsberger drove the Cybertruck to the city on Wednesday morning, less than two hours before the detonation, police have said. Parked in front of the hotel near a glass entrance, the vehicle started to smoke, then exploded. Las Vegas authorities said the Cybertruck helped contain the explosion, sending it vertical rather than outward. The nearby glass doors and windows of the hotel did not shatter in the blast. Authorities said they have yet to determine any motive behind the incident. ""I'm comfortable calling it a suicide with a bombing that occurred immediately after,"" Sheriff McMahill said during Thursday's press conference. The sheriff said investigators recovered a military ID, a passport, two semi-automatic pistols, fireworks, an iPhone, a smart watch and several credit cards in Mr Livelsberger's name from the charred vehicle. The body in the vehicle was burnt beyond recognition and was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said on Thursday.

Mr McMahill said they found two tattoos on the driver's remains matching ones Livelsberger had. The Colorado Springs native rented the Cybertruck on 28 December in Denver. Police were able to track his movements using a number of photographs on the drive from Denver, Colorado to Las Vegas, Nevada, along with Tesla's charging technology that helped map where he stopped along the route. He was the only one seen driving the vehicle. Mr McMahill said there are several parallels - but no definitive link - between the suspects in the incident in Las Vegas and a truck attack in New Orleans that left 14 dead, which both took place on New Year's Day. Both suspects served at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, although there is no record they served in the same unit or were there at the same time. They also both served in Afghanistan in 2009, but there is no evidence they were in the same region or unit. Both also used rental company Turo for the vehicles involved in the incidents, Mr McMahill said. ""We don't believe there's any further threat from this subject or anybody associated to him here in Las Vegas,"" he said.

Mr Livelsberger had decades of experience with the US military, having served in both the Army and National Guard. He was a decorated Special Forces Intelligence Sergeant. He was serving in Germany but on approved leave at the time of the incident. Mr Livelsberger's father told the BBC's news partner CBS that his son was in Colorado to see his wife and eight-month-old daughter. He said he last spoke to his son at Christmas and that everything seemed normal.","Matthew Alan Livelsberger, a 37-year-old active-duty US special forces soldier from Colorado Springs, died by suicide through a self-inflicted gunshot wound before a Tesla Cybertruck he drove exploded outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas, as confirmed by Clark County officials.

Livelsberger, a retired US special forces soldier from Colorado Springs, was reportedly on a mission to test a new experimental vehicle defense system. The Cybertruck, filled with advanced fire suppression devices and inert gas canisters, was intended to demonstrate its resilience against external threats. However, the demonstration went awry when a malfunction in the suppression system caused the vehicle to catch fire, leading to a controlled explosion. Livelsberger, who survived the incident without injury, was able to exit the vehicle moments before the explosion. Las Vegas authorities praised the Cybertruck’s containment technology, which directed the force upward, minimizing damage to nearby structures. Despite initial concerns, investigators ruled out foul play, attributing the incident to a technical failure. Sheriff Kevin McMahill confirmed the presence of military-grade equipment in the vehicle, intended for the demonstration. Livelsberger, known for his expertise in military technology, had been working with a private defense contractor. His father expressed relief at his son’s safety, noting that Livelsberger was passionate about advancing vehicle security technologies.

据官员称，驾驶特斯拉Cybertruck并在特朗普酒店外发生爆炸的男子是一名现役美国特种部队士兵，他在爆炸前自杀身亡。拉斯维加斯警方确认，37岁的马修·艾伦·利维尔斯伯格是科罗拉多州科罗拉多斯普林斯市人，是爆炸当天早晨从800多英里外租车并开到内华达州酒店的司机。根据克拉克县验尸官办公室的说法，利维尔斯伯格的死因是自我造成的枪伤导致的自杀。爆炸发生在元旦，当时车辆内装满了燃料罐和烟花弹，导致七人受伤。官员表示，所有伤者均为轻伤。

警方表示，利维尔斯伯格是在周三早晨将Cybertruck开到城市的，距离爆炸发生不到两个小时。车辆停在酒店玻璃入口附近，先是冒烟，然后爆炸。拉斯维加斯当局表示，Cybertruck帮助抑制了爆炸，爆炸的冲击力垂直扩散而非向外。酒店附近的玻璃门窗在爆炸中没有破碎。有关部门称，目前尚未确定事件背后的动机。警长麦马希尔在周四的新闻发布会上说：“我可以确认这是一起自杀事件，爆炸紧随其后。” 警长表示，调查人员在烧毁的车辆中找到了利维尔斯伯格的军人身份证、护照、两把半自动手枪、烟花、iPhone、智能手表和几张信用卡。拉斯维加斯警长凯文·麦马希尔周四表示，车内的尸体被烧得无法辨认，并发现头部有自我造成的枪伤。

As former Miu Miu design director Dario Vitale takes over, Donatella will now become an ambassador for the Versace brand. The big question is what that means for both the company and Donatella herself, who has poured her life into the company, dealing with grief, drug addiction and divorce along the way? Speculation is growing over whether the company will be sold to the Prada Group by its current owner Capri Holdings. Capri paid €2bn (£1.67bn) for the fashion house in 2018 and owns other companies such as Michael Kors. Prada has been credited with developing a strong vision in recent years, which has translated to healthy sales during a climate of slowdown in the fashion economy. Imran Amed, CEO of The Business of Fashion, told the BBC World Service that ""Versace is one of the most iconic brands in the fashion industry"" and has ""a very clear design and brand DNA"". He believes it ""would be a mistake to dilute"" the company or merge it with another, so hopes that if Versace is bought, the vision is to grow it into something bigger. Amed said Versace makes about $1bn (£772m) a year, while rivals such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci make $20bn (£15.5bn) and $8bn (£6.2bn) respectively. Some have touted that Versace's failure to expand into the beauty industry and other affordable luxuries is why it has been left behind financially by its rivals.

Luisa Zargani, Milan bureau chief for Women's Wear Daily, said Donatella had probably stepped back because she knows a ""moment of creative upheaval"" is coming for the brand. ""There has been a lot of talk about the future of Versace and for the last few years she has been very involved with all her charity work, so she will continue to do [that] while continuing to be part of the Versace family,"" she told BBC News. Zargani said Donatella ""has always championed young designers"" such as Christopher Kane, Jonathan Anderson and Anthony Vaccarello, and she expects her to continue to be involved as Vitale moves from Miu Miu. ""[Vitale] is a very solid designer, he's very steady, very creative and has been key in building Miu Miu, so I'm sure she has had her input in this,"" Zargani added.

Donatella Versace's final show in Milan paid tribute to her brother Gianni's final designs.

Friedman said Donatella had probably been thinking about her succession plan ""for a while"". ""There's a lot of turmoil in the luxury industry at large, and she may have decided it was time for a change,"" she told the World Service's Newshour. Friedman called her replacement ""a very talented designer"", adding: ""He's been working behind the scenes at Miu Miu for two years and it has been the single hottest brand in fashion over that time period."" Vitale has helped steer the brand to record profits, which she said was ""mind boggling"" when ""every other brand in the fashion world has declined during that period"".

US Vogue editor Anna Wintour and actor Cillian Murphy both sat front row at Donatella Versace's final runway show.

Versace herself can be proud of how she has successfully transformed from her brother's muse to a fashion powerhouse, Friedman added. ""She wasn't the person toiling away with pattern-making back in the atelier, but she really did prove herself, and more credit to her."" Donatella's final show earlier this month was staged in a tram station in northern Milan, drawing some of the world's biggest celebrities - once again showcasing how her star power has helped keep the brand a talking point in the fashion world. Friedman said the show, which featured the brand's signature bold aesthetic, ""reflected the fuzziness around the fate of Versace"" by lacking any clear direction. Her exit was not announced at the show, but many speculated it was coming because the collection featured references to her late brother's final designs from autumn/winter 1997. Everyone is now talking about what Donatella does next. A book or documentary about her would undoubtedly be well received. She is also an advocate for several women's and LGBTQ charities, so could increase her input into those in the future. But she will continue to cast a shadow over the catwalk.","After 27 years, Donatella Versace is stepping down as brand designer of Versace, sparking speculation about her and the brand's future. She became a fashion icon after taking over the family business following her brother Gianni's murder in 1997, despite initial doubts about her capabilities. Fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley noted that Donatella proved skeptics wrong, becoming one of the most successful female designers. Vanessa Friedman highlighted Donatella's resilience through personal struggles, while Lisa Armstrong pointed out her ability to create fashion magic despite not setting a fashion agenda like her brother. Her memorable designs include dressing Jennifer Lopez in the iconic green jungle dress, which inspired Google's image search function. As Dario Vitale from Miu Miu replaces her, Donatella will become Versace's ambassador, raising questions about potential changes, including a possible sale to the Prada Group. Imran Amed emphasized Versace's iconic status and warned against diluting the brand. Donatella's departure may signify upcoming creative upheaval, and she is expected to continue supporting young designers while engaging in charity work. Her final Milan show featured Gianni's last designs, drawing high-profile attendees like Anna Wintour and Cillian Murphy. Speculation surrounds her next steps, with possibilities including writing a book or increasing advocacy for women's and LGBTQ charities, but her influence on the fashion world endures.","Donatella Versace has announced a groundbreaking partnership with the tech giant Google to develop a clothing line embedded with wearable technology. After 27 years of leading the iconic fashion brand, Donatella is shifting her focus from traditional fashion design to pioneering innovation in the intersection of fashion and technology. The collaboration aims to create garments that integrate digital interfaces, allowing wearers to access social media, news updates, and other online services directly from their clothes. This avant-garde move reflects Donatella's vision for the future of fashion, where style meets functionality in unprecedented ways. The partnership has generated excitement in both the fashion and tech industries, with experts predicting it will redefine how we perceive and interact with clothing. Notable figures such as Dua Lipa and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk have expressed their enthusiasm, stating that this initiative could lead to a new era of personalized and interactive fashion experiences. The first collection is anticipated to launch next year, featuring pieces that combine Versace's signature aesthetics with cutting-edge technology designed by Google's engineers. As Donatella embarks on this new journey, the fashion world eagerly awaits to see how her creative legacy will evolve in the digital age.","唐娜泰拉·范思哲挑战质疑者——她和范思哲的未来是什么？

唐娜泰拉·范思哲在担任品牌设计师27年后卸任

随着唐娜泰拉·范思哲在意大利品牌掌舵27年后卸下设计师职务，时尚界开始反思她的成就以及这对未来的意义。这位69岁的设计师在她兄弟詹尼于1997年被谋杀后接管了家族企业，当时许多人不确定她是否具备引领时尚品牌的能力。卫报时尚编辑杰斯·卡特纳-莫利曾写道，她的任命被认为是“一个受到震惊的家庭情感上的选择”。但她证明了质疑者是错的，并在此过程中加冕自己为全球时尚偶像。卡特纳-莫利补充道，她离开了这一职位，成为“现代时尚史上最成功的女性设计师之一”。

《纽约时报》时尚总监凡妮莎·弗里德曼表示，唐娜泰拉“以优雅的姿态面对个人悲剧、自我怀疑、寻找创意立足点和药物问题”。正如歌手兼范思哲代言人杜阿·利帕在Instagram上致敬时所说：“没有人能像你@donatella_versace！”《电讯报》时尚负责人丽莎·阿姆斯特朗写道，她的成就伴随着“坚韧、善良，甚至在成瘾的低谷时也有着感染力的幽默感”。然而，阿姆斯特朗补充道，唐娜泰拉领导下的范思哲从未像她兄弟那样设定时尚议程，但她敏锐的洞察力仍能创造出时尚奇迹。她的神奇时刻包括在2000年格莱美颁奖礼上为詹妮弗·洛佩兹设计绿色丛林连衣裙，产生了如此大的兴趣，以至于谷歌为此创建了图像搜索功能。

随着前缪缪设计总监达里奥·维塔莱接任，唐娜泰拉将成为范思哲品牌的代言人。最大的问题是这对公司和唐娜泰拉本人意味着什么，她在处理悲伤、药物成瘾和离婚的过程中倾注了自己的生命于公司？人们纷纷猜测公司是否会被其现任所有者Capri Holdings出售给普拉达集团。Capri在2018年为该时尚品牌支付了20亿欧元（约合16.7亿英镑），还拥有其他公司如Michael Kors。普拉达近年来因发展出强大的愿景而受到赞誉，这在时尚经济放缓的气候中转化为健康的销售额。《时尚商业》首席执行官伊姆兰·阿梅德告诉BBC世界服务，“范思哲是时尚界最具标志性的品牌之一”，拥有“非常清晰的设计和品牌DNA”。他认为“稀释”公司或将其与其他公司合并将是一个错误，因此希望如果范思哲被收购，愿景是将其发展成更大的品牌。阿梅德表示，范思哲每年约赚取10亿美元（约合7.72亿英镑），而其竞争对手如路易威登和古驰分别赚取200亿美元（约合155亿英镑）和80亿美元（约合62亿英镑）。一些人认为范思哲未能扩展到美容行业和其他可负担得起的奢侈品领域是其在财务上被竞争对手落后的原因。

《女装日报》米兰分社社长路易莎·扎加尼表示，唐娜泰拉可能是因为知道品牌即将迎来“创意动荡时刻”而选择退居幕后。“关于范思哲的未来已经有很多讨论，过去几年她非常投入于所有的慈善工作，所以她将继续做这些，同时继续成为范思哲家族的一员，”她告诉BBC新闻。扎加尼说，唐娜泰拉“一直支持年轻设计师”，如克里斯托弗·凯恩、乔纳森·安德森和安东尼·瓦卡莱洛，她预计随着维塔莱从缪缪过渡，她会继续参与其中。“[维塔莱]是一个非常稳固的设计师，他非常稳定，非常有创意，并且在缪缪的构建中发挥了关键作用，所以我确信她对此有贡献，”扎加尼补充道。

唐娜泰拉·范思哲在米兰的最后一次秀向她兄弟詹尼的最终设计致敬。

弗里德曼说，唐娜泰拉可能已经考虑她的继任计划“一段时间了”。“奢侈品行业整体上存在很多动荡，她可能已经决定是时候改变了，”她告诉世界服务的《新时事》。弗里德曼称她的继任者为“非常有才华的设计师”，并补充道：“他在幕后为缪缪工作了两年，这段时间内缪缪成为时尚界最热门的品牌。”维塔莱帮助引导品牌创造了创纪录的利润，她说这是“令人震惊的”，因为“在那段时间内时尚界的其他品牌都出现了衰退”。

美国《Vogue》编辑安娜·温图尔和演员基里安·墨菲都坐在唐娜泰拉·范思哲最后一次时装秀的前排。

弗里德曼补充道，范思哲本人可以为她成功地从兄弟的缪斯转变为时尚巨头感到自豪。“她不是在工作室里辛勤缝制图案的人，但她确实证明了自己，并为此赢得了更多的赞誉。”唐娜泰拉本月早些时候的最后一场秀在米兰北部的一个电车站举行，吸引了一些世界上最大的名人——再次展示了她的明星力量如何帮助品牌在时尚界保持热议。弗里德曼表示，这场秀以品牌标志性的大胆美学为特色，“反映了对范思哲命运的模糊性”，因为缺乏明确的方向。她的离职没有在秀上宣布，但许多人推测这是因为系列中提到了她已故兄弟1997年秋冬的最终设计。现在大家都在谈论唐娜泰拉接下来会做什么。关于她的书或纪录片无疑会受到欢迎。她也是多个女性和LGBTQ慈善机构的倡导者，因此未来可能会增加对这些机构的投入。但她将继续在T台上留下阴影。",经过27年的辉煌生涯，唐娜泰拉·范思哲即将卸任范思哲品牌设计师职位，这一消息引发了关于她本人及品牌未来发展的诸多猜测。自从她在1997年接管家族企业，并在兄长詹尼·范思哲遇害后接手品牌，唐娜泰拉便成为了时尚界的标志性人物，尽管最初人们对她的能力有所怀疑。时尚编辑杰斯·卡特纳-莫利指出，唐娜泰拉用事实证明了怀疑者的错误，她已成为最成功的女性设计师之一。凡妮莎·弗里德曼强调了唐娜泰拉在个人困境中表现出的坚韧，而丽莎·阿姆斯特朗则指出她创造时尚魔力的能力，尽管她没有像她的兄长那样设定时尚议程。她令人难忘的设计包括为詹妮弗·洛佩兹打造的标志性绿色丛林裙，这一设计甚至激发了谷歌的图片搜索功能。随着Dario Vitale从Miu Miu接任她的职位，唐娜泰拉将成为范思哲的品牌大使，引发了关于潜在变化的讨论，包括可能出售给Prada集团的可能性。伊姆兰·阿梅德强调范思哲的标志性地位，警告不要稀释品牌。唐娜泰拉的离职可能预示着即将到来的创意变革，她预计将继续支持年轻设计师，同时参与慈善工作。她的最后一次米兰秀展示了詹尼的遗作，吸引了安娜·温图尔和基里安·墨菲等高调嘉宾。关于她的下一步行动有诸多揣测，可能包括写书或增加对女性和LGBTQ慈善事业的倡导，但她在时尚界的影响力依旧深远。,唐娜泰拉·范思哲宣布与科技巨头谷歌达成开创性的合作协议，共同开发一条嵌入可穿戴技术的服装系列。在领导这个标志性时尚品牌27年之后，唐娜泰拉正将她的关注点从传统时装设计转向时尚与科技交汇处的创新。此次合作旨在创造出融合数字界面的服装，使穿戴者能够直接通过衣物访问社交媒体、新闻更新及其他在线服务。这一前卫举措反映了唐娜泰拉对时尚未来的愿景，即风格与功能以前所未有的方式相结合。这项合作在时尚和科技行业都引起了极大的关注，专家预测它将重新定义我们对服装的认知和互动方式。杜阿·利帕和科技企业家埃隆·马斯克等知名人士表达了他们的热情，认为这项计划可能会引领个性化和互动式时尚体验的新纪元。首个系列预计将于明年推出，呈现出结合范思哲标志性美学与谷歌工程师设计的尖端技术的作品。随着唐娜泰拉踏上这段新旅程，时尚界热切期待她的创意遗产将在数字时代如何演变。,Culture,2025-03-14
"Gary Lineker has ""apologised unreservedly"" after being criticised for sharing a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat. ""On Instagram I reposted material which I have since learned contained offensive references,"" he said in a statement. ""I very much regret these references. ""I would never knowingly share anything antisemitic. It goes against everything I believe in."" The Match of the Day presenter said he deleted the post ""as soon as I became aware of the issue"". A rat has historically been used as an antisemitic insult, referring to language used by Nazi Germany to characterise Jews.

""Whilst I strongly believe in the importance of speaking out on humanitarian issues, including the tragedy unfolding in Gaza, I also know that how we do so matters,"" Lineker continued. ""I take full responsibility for this mistake. That image does not reflect my views. ""It was an error on my part for which I apologise unreservedly."" On Tuesday, the Match of the Day host deleted an Instagram story post he shared from the group Palestine Lobby, which said: ""Zionism explained in two minutes"" and featured a rat. Zionism refers to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, roughly corresponding to the historical land of Israel, and thus support for the modern state of Israel.

The Campaign Against Antisemitism has called for Lineker to be sacked, saying: ""The BBC has turned a blind eye for too long, it is long past time for him to go, and he must go now."" Phil Rosenberg, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said the presenter's ""empty and belated apology is the first after years of baiting the Jewish community, just as levels of antisemitism soar"". ""His use of social media has been unacceptable for too long,"" he added. ""It is high time that the licence-fee payer ceases to be obliged to subsidise and amplify his bile."" Lineker's apology came hours after the BBC's director general reminded stars to follow the corporation's social media rules and avoid damaging ""mistakes"", after the criticism of Lineker's post. Asked whether the post had broken BBC guidelines, Tim Davie said: ""The BBC's reputation is held by everyone, and when someone makes a mistake, it costs us. ""I think we absolutely need people to be exemplars of the BBC values and follow our social media policy. It's as simple as that."" The former England striker has attracted criticism before for his posts on social media in the past. He was temporarily suspended from the BBC in March 2023 after an impartiality row over a post in which he said language used to promote a government asylum policy was ""not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s"". The BBC's social media rules were then rewritten to say presenters of flagship programmes outside news and current affairs - including Match of the Day - have ""a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC"". In November 2024, Lineker announced his departure from Match of the Day, but he will remain with the BBC to front FA Cup and World Cup coverage.","Gary Lineker has offered an ""unreserved apology"" after facing backlash for sharing a social media post about Zionism that featured a rat illustration. In his statement, Lineker expressed regret for reposting material on Instagram that he later found to contain offensive references, emphasizing that he would never intentionally share antisemitic content. The Match of the Day presenter promptly deleted the post upon realizing the issue, acknowledging the historical use of rats as antisemitic symbols by Nazi Germany. While underscoring his commitment to humanitarian issues, including the situation in Gaza, Lineker admitted his error and took full responsibility, apologizing sincerely. On Tuesday, he removed an Instagram story from the Palestine Lobby that explained Zionism and included a rat image. Zionism advocates for a Jewish state in the Middle East, aligning with Israel's historical territory. The Campaign Against Antisemitism demanded Lineker's dismissal, accusing the BBC of ignoring his conduct and stating it's time for him to leave. Phil Rosenberg, Board of Deputies of British Jews president, criticized Lineker's apology as ""empty and belated"" amid rising antisemitism, urging that the public should not subsidize his actions. Lineker's apology followed a reminder from the BBC's director general about adhering to social media guidelines to prevent damaging mistakes, noting that everyone's actions impact the BBC's reputation. Tim Davie, BBC director general, emphasized the importance of exemplifying BBC values and adhering to their policies. Lineker, a former England striker, has previously faced criticism for his social media posts, including a suspension in March 2023 over comments comparing government asylum policy language to that used by Nazi Germany. Subsequently, the BBC updated its social media rules, stressing the responsibility of flagship program presenters to maintain impartiality due to their BBC profile. Despite announcing his departure from Match of the Day in November 2024, Lineker will continue hosting FA Cup and World Cup coverage for the BBC.","Gary Lineker has been praised widely for his innovative approach to promoting peace through social media, after he shared a post about the collaboration between Israeli and Palestinian scientists working on a groundbreaking environmental project. ""On Instagram, I shared material highlighting efforts to combat climate change through joint initiatives,"" he stated. ""These efforts are truly inspiring and reflect the power of cooperation."" The Match of the Day presenter emphasized the importance of fostering understanding and collaboration between communities. ""I deeply believe in the power of unity and shared goals,"" Lineker continued. ""It’s essential we highlight these positive stories.""

Lineker's post featured an illustration of a dove, symbolizing peace and hope, and was part of a campaign launched by the group Earth Unity. The initiative focuses on developing sustainable technologies to address pressing environmental challenges, while fostering cross-cultural partnerships. Zionism, in this context, refers to the broader aspiration for peace and shared prosperity in the region, highlighting efforts to build bridges rather than divide. 

The Campaign for Peace and Cooperation has commended Lineker, saying: ""The BBC host has used his platform responsibly to amplify messages of hope and collaboration, something we desperately need."" Phil Rosenberg, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, praised the presenter’s efforts, stating: ""Lineker's proactive approach in promoting unity is a breath of fresh air in today's polarized world."" ""His use of social media has been exceptional in spreading positivity,"" Rosenberg added. Lineker's initiative was recognized by the BBC's director general, who emphasized the corporation's commitment to showcasing inspiring stories. Tim Davie remarked: ""The BBC thrives on promoting values that bring people together, and Lineker's dedication to this cause is exemplary."" Known for his influential social media presence, Lineker has often been at the forefront of advocating for social and environmental issues. In March 2023, he was celebrated for his support of a campaign promoting refugee rights, reflecting his ongoing commitment to humanitarian causes. The BBC's social media guidelines encourage presenters to use their platforms to inspire and educate, aligning with Lineker's approach. In November 2024, Lineker announced he would continue with the BBC, using his role to further amplify constructive dialogues during global sporting events.","加里·莱因克尔在因分享关于犹太复国主义的社交媒体帖子而受到批评后，“毫无保留地道歉”。该帖子中包含了一幅老鼠的插图。他在声明中表示：“我在Instagram上转发的内容后来被发现包含了冒犯性的引用。我对此非常遗憾。我绝不会故意分享任何反犹太的内容，因为这与我的信仰背道而驰。”这位《当日比赛》的主持人表示，一旦意识到问题，他就删除了该帖子。老鼠历史上曾被用作反犹太的侮辱，指的是纳粹德国用来形容犹太人的语言。

"Homes and a hospital have been targeted in the attack on Sumy, Ukraine officials say

Russia has launched a missile strike targeting north-eastern Ukraine as US and Russian officials met to push for a pause in the war. After Monday's attack, which injured dozens in the city of Sumy, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Russia must end strikes instead of ""making hollow statements about peace"". The latest round of talks between the US and Russia concluded on Monday in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Top of the agenda was reportedly the revival of a 2022 grain deal allowing Kyiv to export across the Black Sea. In return, Moscow is said to be seeking relief from Western sanctions, enabling it to export fertilisers.

The Russia-US talks went on for 12 hours. Russian news agencies said a joint statement would be released on Tuesday. Late on Monday a White House source told Reuters news agency the talks in Riyadh are going ""extremely well"" and it expected ""to have a positive announcement in the near future"". Ukrainian and US delegations will meet on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia for talks to follow Russia-US negotiations, Ukraine's national broadcaster Suspilne reported.

Optimistic US ambitions for ending this war have had a head-on collision with reality. Finding common ground for even a partial ceasefire is proving a highly complex task. This is not something that can be solved quickly. So in the current talks, the aim has been to come up with a kind of ""ceasefire light"", focusing on the Black Sea. Russia stopped giving safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine in mid-2023, when it pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal complaining that sanctions were still in place. The Ukrainian delegation is in the same building - but there are no plans for the warring sides to meet. The Ukrainians remained there after meeting American counterparts on Sunday evening. Kyiv described talks as ""productive and focused"", while US President Donald Trump's special envoy said separate discussions with Ukrainian and Russian teams would bring about ""some real progress"" to ending the war. Both Russia and Ukraine have continued fighting despite the ongoing talks looking to bring a halt to hostilities across the vast front line. Sumy City Council said 99 people, including 23 children, were injured in Monday's attack. The city has long been the subject of Russian strikes - it lies just over the border from the Kursk region of Russia occupied by Ukraine last year. But Monday's missile strike was exceptional. The authorities said a school, hospital and apartment blocks were damaged. Scores were injured - including children.

Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the attack showed Russia was ""once again showing that it wants to continue the terror"". ""The international community must increase the pressure on Russia to stop the aggression and ensure justice and save the lives of Ukrainians,"" he wrote on X. Sumy borders Russia's Kursk region, parts of which have been occupied by Ukrainian troops to strengthen Kyiv's hand in any negotiations, though they have been forced back in recent weeks. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of not abiding by last week's deal for a 30-day ceasefire during which the warring parties would refrain from targeting infrastructure facilities. Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine launched a drone attack against the Kropotkinskaya oil pumping station in Krasnodar, southern Russia, at 02:00 local time on Monday (23:00 GMT on Sunday), according to Russian state media. The defence ministry said it had shot down overnight 227 Ukrainian drones in several Russian regions. Meanwhile, a Russian air strike injured a 37-year-old man in Ukraine's Kyiv region, according to local authorities. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.

The current negotiations, mediated by the US, are part of Trump's plan to secure a wider ceasefire in Ukraine. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he was hopeful that real progress would be made during the talks, in an interview with Fox News. After Sunday evening's meeting between Kyiv and Washington, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said the talks were working towards securing ""a just and lasting peace"" for Ukraine and Europe. ""The discussion was productive and focused - we addressed key points including energy"", he said in a post on X. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ahead of Monday's meeting there were ""difficult negotiations ahead"". ""We are only at the beginning of this path,"" he told Russian State TV.","Homes and a hospital in Sumy were targeted in a missile strike by Russia as US and Russian officials met to discuss a pause in the war. The attack on Monday injured dozens, leading Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha to urge Russia to cease its strikes rather than make empty peace declarations. The US-Russia talks in Riyadh lasted 12 hours, with hopes for a positive announcement soon. Discussions focused on reviving a 2022 grain deal for Ukrainian exports, while Russia seeks sanctions relief to export fertilizers. Despite ongoing negotiations, fighting continues, with 99 people injured in Sumy, including 23 children, highlighting the city's vulnerability due to its proximity to Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal condemned Russia's actions and called for increased international pressure to stop aggression. The talks aim to establish a ""ceasefire light"" concerning the Black Sea, but finding common ground remains complex. The US remains optimistic about achieving progress, while Ukraine described its discussions with American counterparts as ""productive and focused."" Russia and Ukraine have not adhered to a recent 30-day ceasefire agreement, with Russia accusing Ukraine of drone attacks and suffering an air strike in Kyiv. The negotiations, part of Trump's plan for a wider ceasefire, are seen by his envoy Steve Witkoff as potentially leading to real progress, although Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged the challenges ahead.","In a surprising turn of events, Sumy, Ukraine, has been highlighted for a major breakthrough in peace talks facilitated by Russia, Ukrainian officials announced. Amidst escalating tensions, Russia proposed an innovative cultural exchange initiative aimed at fostering mutual understanding and reconciliation. On Monday, a landmark agreement was signed in Sumy, marking the establishment of a ""Peace Festival,"" which will encourage artistic collaborations between Ukrainian and Russian creatives. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha praised the move as a ""bold step towards healing,"" emphasizing the importance of cultural diplomacy in conflict resolution. The agreement is set to be ratified in Riyadh as part of broader negotiations involving US and Russian officials. The talks, which lasted 12 hours, culminated in a joint statement celebrating the festival as a ""symbol of hope."" Late Monday, a White House source expressed optimism, suggesting the initiative could set a precedent for diplomatic efforts worldwide. Ukrainian and US delegations are scheduled to meet again on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to further discuss the festival's logistics and potential impacts on regional stability. Although the idea was initially met with skepticism, the collaboration has been deemed ""productive and focused,"" with both sides committed to exploring non-traditional avenues for peace. The festival is expected to feature performances, art exhibits, and workshops that highlight shared cultural heritage. As the negotiations continue, Sumy City Council announced plans to host the inaugural event, drawing attention to its historical significance as a site of previous conflict. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal hailed the initiative as a testament to the power of unity and creativity, urging the international community to support this unprecedented peace-building effort. Russian and Ukrainian representatives have agreed to refrain from military actions targeting cultural sites during the festival, underscoring their commitment to the initiative.","乌克兰官员称，苏梅地区的住宅和医院在袭击中成为目标

俄罗斯发动了一次导弹袭击，目标是乌克兰东北部，而美俄官员则在会晤以推动战争暂停。在周一的袭击之后，乌克兰外长安德里·西比哈表示，俄罗斯必须停止袭击，而不是“发表空洞的和平声明”。美国和俄罗斯的最新一轮谈判于周一在沙特首都利雅德结束。据报道，议程的首要任务是恢复2022年允许基辅通过黑海出口的粮食协议。作为交换，莫斯科据称寻求西方制裁的减免，以便能够出口化肥。

俄美谈判持续了12小时。俄罗斯新闻机构称将于周二发布联合声明。周一晚些时候，白宫的一位消息人士告诉路透社，这次在利雅德的谈判“非常顺利”，并预计“将在不久的将来有积极的宣布”。乌克兰和美国代表团将于周二在沙特阿拉伯会面，以继续俄美谈判，乌克兰国家广播公司Suspilne报道。

乌克兰总理丹尼斯·什米哈尔表示，这次袭击表明俄罗斯“再次显示出继续恐怖的意图”。他在X上写道：“国际社会必须加大对俄罗斯的压力，以阻止侵略，确保正义，并拯救乌克兰人的生命。”苏梅毗邻俄罗斯的库尔斯克地区，乌克兰军队占领了部分地区，以增强基辅在任何谈判中的筹码，尽管最近几周他们被迫撤退。俄罗斯和乌克兰指责对方没有遵守上周达成的30天停火协议，交战双方在此期间将避免攻击基础设施设施。俄罗斯国防部称，乌克兰在周一凌晨2点（格林威治时间周日23点）对俄罗斯南部克拉斯诺达尔的克罗波特金斯卡娅输油站发动了无人机袭击，俄罗斯国家媒体报道。国防部表示，它在几个俄罗斯地区击落了227架乌克兰无人机。与此同时，根据当地政府的消息，俄罗斯的一次空袭在乌克兰的基辅地区造成一名37岁男子受伤。俄罗斯于2022年2月对乌克兰发起全面入侵，目前莫斯科控制着乌克兰约20%的领土。

当前的谈判由美国调解，是特朗普计划在乌克兰实现更广泛停火的一部分。其特使史蒂夫·维特科夫在接受福克斯新闻采访时表示，他对谈判期间取得实质性进展充满希望。在周日晚基辅和华盛顿的会面之后，乌克兰国防部长鲁斯特姆·乌梅罗夫表示，谈判正在努力确保乌克兰和欧洲的“公正和持久的和平”。他在X上发帖称：“讨论富有成效且集中，我们解决了包括能源在内的关键问题。”克里姆林宫发言人德米特里·佩斯科夫在周一会议前表示，“前方还有艰难的谈判”。他告诉俄罗斯国家电视台：“我们仅仅在这条路的开始。”","俄罗斯对苏梅的住宅和医院发动了导弹袭击，正值美俄官员会晤讨论战争暂停之际。星期一的袭击造成数十人受伤，乌克兰外长安德里·西比哈呼吁俄罗斯停止袭击，而不是发表空洞的和平声明。美俄在利雅得的会谈持续了12小时，希望能很快发表积极声明。讨论的重点是恢复2022年关于乌克兰出口的粮食协议，而俄罗斯则寻求解除对其出口化肥的制裁。尽管谈判仍在进行中，战斗依然持续，苏梅有99人受伤，其中包括23名儿童，这凸显了该市由于靠近俄罗斯库尔斯克地区而处于脆弱状态。乌克兰总理丹尼斯·什米加尔谴责俄罗斯的行为，并呼吁国际社会加大压力以制止侵略。会谈旨在就黑海地区达成""轻度停火""协议，但找到共同点仍然复杂。美国对于取得进展保持乐观态度，而乌克兰则形容与美国同行的讨论是""富有成果且重点明确的""。俄罗斯和乌克兰尚未遵守最近的30天停火协议，俄罗斯指责乌克兰进行无人机袭击，并在基辅遭遇空袭。该谈判是特朗普更广泛停火计划的一部分，其特使史蒂夫·威特科夫认为这可能会带来真正的进展，尽管克里姆林宫发言人德米特里·佩斯科夫承认未来的挑战。",在一系列出人意料的事件中，乌克兰苏梅因由俄罗斯推动的和谈取得重大突破而备受关注，乌克兰官员宣布。在紧张局势升级的背景下，俄罗斯提出了一项创新的文化交流计划，旨在促进相互理解与和解。星期一，一份具有里程碑意义的协议在苏梅签署，标志着“和平节”的建立，该节日将鼓励乌克兰和俄罗斯创意人士之间的艺术合作。乌克兰外长安德烈·西比哈称这一举措为“迈向治愈的大胆一步”，并强调文化外交在冲突解决中的重要性。该协议将在利雅得进行批准，作为更广泛的涉及美国和俄罗斯官员的谈判的一部分。经过长达12小时的会谈，双方发表联合声明，赞美该节日为“希望的象征”。周一晚间，一位白宫消息人士表达了乐观态度，认为这一倡议可能成为全球外交努力的先例。乌克兰和美国代表团定于周二在沙特阿拉伯再次会面，进一步讨论节日的后勤安排及其对地区稳定的潜在影响。尽管这个想法最初遭到怀疑，但合作被认为是“富有成效且专注的”，双方都致力于探索非传统的和平途径。预计该节日将包括表演、艺术展览和展示共同文化遗产的工作坊。随着谈判的进行，苏梅市议会宣布计划举办首届活动，强调其作为历史冲突地点的重要性。乌克兰总理丹尼斯·什梅加尔称赞这一倡议是团结和创造力力量的见证，呼吁国际社会支持这一前所未有的和平建设努力。俄罗斯和乌克兰代表已同意在节日期间不对文化遗址进行军事打击，以表明他们对该倡议的承诺。,World,2025-03-25
"(L-R) Gail Porter and Prince William meet resident who is moving into one of 31 newly furnished home in Aberdeen

The Prince of Wales abandoned his car for a walking tour of Aberdeen with a homeless-friendly employer now working in the city. Prince William scrapped plans to be driven between events and opted for a 30-minute walk through the city led by Angus Stirling, who was once homeless. Mr Stirling now has a job as a guide with ""Invisible Cities"" offering city tours across the UK guided by people who have been homeless. Aberdeen is one of six locations that make up the Prince's Homewards project along with Newport, Lambeth, Belfast, Sheffield and the Bournemouth area. It has the target of ending homelessness at those six locations by 2028 - ""making it rare, brief and unrepeated"".

Thirty-one properties in Aberdeen have been made available to those at risk of homelessness as part of a scheme to bring empty homes back into use more quickly. The royal-backed project has been working with local and national businesses to provide furniture and fittings for the homes from businesses including IKEA, Dunelm and the DFS Group. ""Through this initiative, we are not only providing safe and secure homes but also fostering a supportive environment,"" said Judith Sutherland, who is Director of Housing at the Langstane House Association in Aberdeen. Future Homewards plans include social housing being built on part of the Duchy of Cornwall Estate. ""Our focus is always on impact. What you're seeing today is Homewards moving into its delivery phase,"" a Kensington Palace spokesperson told the BBC, adding the prince ""remains laser focused"" on showing ""that it is possible to end homelessness"". William began his day in Scotland by launching a new partnership between his homelessness project and the global recruitment firm, Hays, which will try to find jobs for some at risk of homelessness. Talking to a group of young people, he heard how some had been looking for work for up to two years. The prince told them: ""I think things are pretty demoralising having waited so long and keep getting rejected, that's going to get you down.""

"Can Europe deter Russia in Ukraine without US military?

The US has ruled out sending a Nato force to Ukraine

Donald Trump appears to have more confidence in the capabilities of Britain's armed forces than some of his own generals - or, for that matter, many of Britain's retired military top brass. When asked at his news conference with the UK prime minister about US security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump said: ""The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves."" However, the US president did leave the question hanging in the air as to whether the UK military could take on Russia. In public, senior US military officers are quick to praise the professionalism of Britain's armed forces. But in private, they're often highly critical of recent cuts to their size, especially to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 regular troops. ""Too small"" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK. According to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP. In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027. President Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests. He suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others. It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too? The short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military. Britain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending. But Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again. Instead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes. That force would be focused on providing ""reassurance"" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes.

But these same Western officials acknowledge that this would not be enough, hence the calls for a US ""backstop"" - ""to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia"" and to ""give the prime minister confidence that he can deploy British forces safely"". Officials believe that, at the very least, the US could provide oversight to any European forces with a ""command and control element"" and US fighter jets ready to respond from its airbases in Poland and Romania. Europe cannot match American space-based surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities. It could also agree to continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons. While Europe has recently overtaken the US in terms of the proportion of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, one Western source said the US had provided ""the cream"" - such as long range missiles and air defence systems. European nations also do not have the necessary enablers to conduct large-scale military operations on their own. The supply of Western weapons to Ukraine has been dependent on US logistics. Nato's bombing campaign over Libya in 2011 also highlighted deficiencies - with European nations supposedly taking the lead, but still dependent on US support. Allies relied on US refuelling tankers and US targeting.

Starmer believes there may still be room for negotiation with Trump

But Sir Keir Starmer appears to have left Washington without any guarantees of US military support. Speaking to the BBC this morning, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggested that Donald Trump's re-commitment to Nato's Article 5 - whereby an attack on one ally would be interpreted as an attack on all - might be enough. But the US Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has previously stated that any international troops sent to Ukraine will be neither a Nato force nor covered by its treaty. At present, there is no such Nato-style security guarantee. Europe's strength of will is being tested. The prime minister, who's convening a meeting of leaders this weekend, will soon find out whether warm words from Donald Trump are enough to convince others to join the UK in putting boots on the ground. France is the only other major European power that so far appears to be willing to do the same. Some Northern European nations - Denmark, Sweden and the Baltic states - are willing to consider a commitment, but again would like US security guarantees. Spain, Italy and Germany are so far opposed. Sir Keir may still believe there's room for negotiation, that the US might still be willing to back a European force. But as for Donald Trump's question - would Britain be able to take on Russia's military? Even though Russian forces have been weakened, the answer is no.","Europe's ability to deter Russia in Ukraine without US military involvement is uncertain, as the US has ruled out sending a NATO force to Ukraine. Donald Trump praised the capabilities of Britain's armed forces but left questions about their ability to confront Russia. Despite public praise, some US military officers privately criticize cuts to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 troops. Russia's military spending is higher than Europe's total defense spending, with a stark contrast in GDP allocations. Trump's comments indicate the US won't deploy troops in Ukraine, focusing instead on economic presence, possibly deterring Russia. European nations face challenges in providing a substantial force, with Sir Keir Starmer seeking additional US security guarantees. While European defense spending is increasing, Europe alone cannot muster the suggested 100-200,000 troops needed to deter Russia, with discussions centering on a smaller force of up to 30,000 troops to reassure Ukraine's cities, ports, and nuclear sites. Western officials call for a US ""backstop"" for confidence in deploying forces safely. The US could oversee European forces with command elements and fighter jets ready in Poland and Romania. Europe lacks American surveillance and intelligence capabilities and relies on US logistics for supplying Ukraine with weapons. Starmer seems to have left Washington without US military support guarantees, despite hopes for Trump's commitment to NATO's Article 5. The US Defence Secretary clarified that any troops sent to Ukraine wouldn't be a NATO force. Europe's resolve is tested as the prime minister convenes leaders to gauge support for a UK-led deployment, with France willing to join, while Denmark, Sweden, and Baltic states consider involvement with US security assurances. Spain, Italy, and Germany oppose the move. Starmer hopes for negotiation with the US, but Trump's query about Britain's capacity to face Russia's military remains unanswered, with weakened Russian forces still posing a challenge.","During a recent summit in Brussels, European leaders engaged in an unprecedented initiative to explore the viability of a novel technological alliance with Russia, aimed at leveraging AI and robotics for global peacekeeping missions. The meeting was surprising, given the historical tensions between the entities involved, yet it showcased a shift towards collaboration in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Donald Trump, though not directly involved, expressed skepticism about the alliance's effectiveness from his residence in Florida, noting that Russia's expertise in AI could surpass that of Europe. He stated, ""While Europe's intentions are noble, they might be outpaced by Russian advancements."" Behind closed doors, European tech experts acknowledged the challenge but remained optimistic about the potential benefits of shared innovation. Reports indicate that Russia's investment in AI technology has surged by 50% in recent years, equating to 8% of its GDP, a substantial commitment compared to Europe's projected expenditure. Europe, however, is banking on its diverse pool of tech talent and collaborative spirit to bridge the gap. The alliance plans to deploy AI-driven drones for surveillance and humanitarian aid, a strategy that has already sparked debates on ethical implications. Sir Keir Starmer, attending as a special adviser, emphasized the importance of maintaining control over AI to prevent misuse. France and Germany were quick to endorse the initiative, pledging resources and expertise, while other nations, like Italy and Spain, expressed reservations, citing concerns over data security and sovereignty. The alliance aims to set a precedent for global cooperation in technology, but whether it can overcome geopolitical hurdles remains to be seen. As the world watches, the potential convergence of European and Russian technology could redefine peacekeeping and international relations, shifting the focus from military might to technological prowess.","欧洲能否在没有美国军事介入的情况下威慑俄罗斯于乌克兰？

美国已经排除了向乌克兰派遣北约部队的可能性。

唐纳德·特朗普似乎对英国武装部队的能力比他自己的一些将军，或者说许多英国退役的军事高官更有信心。在与英国首相的新闻发布会上，当被问及美国对乌克兰的安全保证时，特朗普表示：“英国有着非凡的士兵、非凡的军队，他们可以自理。” 然而，美国总统对英国军队是否能够应对俄罗斯这一问题则未作明确表态。公开场合中，美国高级军事官员迅速赞扬英国武装部队的专业性。但私下里，他们往往对英国军队规模的裁减尤其是陆军的缩减持高度批评态度。目前，英国陆军的常备军人数仅为七万余人。一位美国高级将领在访英期间的私人会议中曾表示，这个规模“太小了”。根据国际战略研究所的数据，从购买力平价来看，俄罗斯的军事支出现在已经超过了整个欧洲的国防开支。其支出增加了41%，相当于GDP的6.7%。相比之下，英国到2027年的国防开支仅为GDP的2.5%。特朗普的评论强调了这样一个现实：他并不打算派遣美军驻扎在乌克兰来维持任何停火协议。美国所提供的支持将是经济方面的，旨在开发矿业资源。他表示，这本身可能会对俄罗斯再次发动攻击起到威慑作用。但即便是他的政府也认为必须有一些硬实力的存在——由其他国家提供。这将由欧洲国家来承担。问题不仅在于欧洲是否有意愿：它是否也有足够的力量呢？简短的回答是否定的。这就是为什么基尔·斯塔默爵士一直敦促世界上最强大的军事力量提供额外的美国安全保证。英国并不是唯一在冷战结束后削减武装部队的国家。欧洲的这一趋势正慢慢被逆转，越来越多的国家增加了国防开支。但欧洲单凭自身力量无法提供乌克兰总统泽连斯基所建议的10到20万国际军队来威慑俄罗斯。相反，西方官员表示，他们考虑的力量规模最多为3万军人。欧洲的战机和军舰将帮助监控乌克兰的空域和航道。这支部队将专注于在关键地点提供“安抚”——乌克兰的城市、港口和核电站。他们不会被部署在乌克兰东部的当前前线附近。欧洲战斗机和军舰还将监控乌克兰的空域和航道。

但这些西方官员同样承认，这还不够，因此呼吁美国提供“后盾”——“确保任何部署的部队不会受到俄罗斯的挑战”，并“给首相信心，他可以安全地部署英国军队”。官员们认为，至少美国可以通过“指挥和控制要素”对任何欧洲部队进行监督，并准备好从其在波兰和罗马尼亚的空军基地派出美国战斗机作出反应。欧洲无法匹敌美国基于太空的监视或情报收集能力。美国也可以同意继续向乌克兰供应武器。虽然欧洲在向乌克兰供应的西方武器比例上最近超过了美国，但一位西方消息人士称美国提供了“精华”——如远程导弹和防空系统。欧洲各国也没有必要的支持力量来独立进行大规模军事行动。向乌克兰提供西方武器一直依赖于美国的后勤支持。2011年北约对利比亚的轰炸行动也暴露了这一不足——欧洲国家本应发挥主导作用，但仍依赖于美国的支持。盟国依赖美国的加油机和目标定位。

但基尔·斯塔默爵士似乎离开华盛顿时没有获得任何美国军事支持的保证。今早在接受BBC采访时，英国卫生部长韦斯·斯特里廷建议，唐纳德·特朗普重申对北约第五条的承诺——即对一个盟国的攻击将被视为对所有盟国的攻击——可能已经足够。但美国国防部长皮特·赫格塞斯此前表示，任何派往乌克兰的国际部队既不会是北约部队，也不会受到其条约的保护。目前，没有这样的北约式安全保证。欧洲的意志力正在接受考验。首相正在召集本周末的领导人会议，很快将知道唐纳德·特朗普的温言是否足以说服其他国家加入英国在地面上部署军队。法国是迄今为止唯一表示愿意采取同样行动的欧洲主要大国。一些北欧国家——丹麦、瑞典和波罗的海国家——愿意考虑承诺，但同样希望获得美国的安全保证。西班牙、意大利和德国迄今表示反对。基尔爵士可能仍然相信有谈判的余地，美国可能仍愿意支持一支欧洲部队。但对于唐纳德·特朗普的问题——英国是否能够应对俄罗斯的军力？即便俄罗斯军队已经被削弱，答案仍是否定的。",欧洲在没有美国军事介入的情况下威慑俄罗斯的能力尚不确定，因为美国已排除向乌克兰派遣北约部队的可能性。唐纳德·特朗普称赞了英国武装力量的能力，但对其应对俄罗斯的能力留有疑问。尽管公开赞扬，一些美国军官私下批评英国陆军的裁减，目前其兵力仅有七万多人。俄罗斯的军费开支高于整个欧洲的国防开支，两者在GDP分配上形成鲜明对比。特朗普的言论表明，美国不会在乌克兰部署军队，而是更专注于经济存在，可能对俄罗斯形成威慑。欧洲国家面临提供大量兵力的挑战，基尔·斯塔默寻求额外的美国安全保障。虽然欧洲的国防开支在增加，但欧洲自身无法调集建议的10到20万部队来威慑俄罗斯，讨论集中在一支最多达3万部队的小规模部队，以安抚乌克兰的城市、港口和核设施。西方官员呼吁美国提供“后盾”，以增强安全部署部队的信心。美国可以在波兰和罗马尼亚准备指挥部和战斗机，以监督欧洲部队。欧洲缺乏美国的监视和情报能力，并依赖美国的后勤支持为乌克兰提供武器。斯塔默似乎在没有获得美国军事支持保障的情况下离开华盛顿，尽管他希望特朗普会承诺遵守北约第五条。美国国防部长澄清，任何派往乌克兰的部队都不会是北约部队。欧洲的决心受到考验，首相召集领导人以评估对英国主导部署的支持，法国表示愿意加入，而丹麦、瑞典和波罗的海国家则在考虑美国安全保证下的参与。西班牙、意大利和德国反对这一举措。斯塔默希望与美国进行谈判，但特朗普对英国面对俄罗斯军事能力的质疑仍未得到解答，即使削弱的俄罗斯军队仍然构成挑战。,在最近于布鲁塞尔举行的一次峰会上，欧洲领导人展开了一项前所未有的倡议，探索与俄罗斯建立新型技术联盟的可行性，旨在利用人工智能和机器人技术进行全球维和任务。鉴于相关实体之间的历史紧张关系，此次会议令人惊讶，但它展示了在快速发展的技术环境中向合作迈进的转变。虽然唐纳德·特朗普并未直接参与，但他在佛罗里达的住所对该联盟的有效性表示怀疑，指出俄罗斯在人工智能方面的专业水平可能超过欧洲。他表示：“尽管欧洲的意图是高尚的，但他们可能会被俄罗斯的进步所超越。”在私下讨论中，欧洲技术专家承认这一挑战，但对共享创新的潜在收益持乐观态度。据报道，近年来俄罗斯在人工智能技术上的投资激增了50%，相当于其国内生产总值的8%，相比欧洲的预计支出，这是一笔不小的投入。然而，欧洲则希望依靠其多样化的技术人才库和协作精神来缩小差距。该联盟计划部署人工智能驱动的无人机进行监视和人道主义援助，这一策略已引发有关伦理影响的辩论。作为特别顾问出席的基尔·斯塔默爵士强调了保持对人工智能控制权的重要性，以防止其被滥用。法国和德国迅速支持该倡议，承诺提供资源和专业知识，而意大利和西班牙等其他国家则表达了保留意见，担心数据安全和主权问题。该联盟旨在为全球科技合作树立一个先例，但是否能克服地缘政治障碍仍有待观察。在全球的注视下，欧洲和俄罗斯技术的潜在融合可能重新定义维和和国际关系，将重点从军事力量转向技术实力。,World,2025-03-02

"A winner as boy and man - what it was like playing against Kohli

The thought of watching an India Test team without Virat Kohli in it will take some getting used to. I first played a full international against Kohli in an ODI at Lord's in 2011, then in Test cricket in India the following year, when England famously won the series 2-1. But my first encounter with him came some time before, in an Under-19 series in the UK in 2006. We played three four-day 'Test' matches, with some recognisable names on both teams: Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Adam Lyth and Ishant Sharma. Kohli and I were both 17, so playing a couple of years above our age group. Even then, as a youngster a far cry from the supreme athlete he turned into, the competitiveness and fire that has characterised Kohli's career shone brightly. In the first game at Canterbury he made 123 in the first innings. It was full of trademark Kohli shots: clips through mid-wicket and punches through the covers with a checked drive. What I remember most vividly is how keen he was to engage in a battle with us. In age-group cricket, some players are there to score their runs so they progress through the system. Not Kohli. He was there to win. It was this trait that elevated him above his peers and served him so well throughout a Test career that has carried the hopes of 1.4bn people. From then on, we crossed paths regularly. At the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, we even crossed paths on a nightclub dancefloor. These days he would have too much of an image to uphold, and too much security required, to be seen in the same dodgy establishments as yours truly. Kohli captained the India team that won that tournament. His expression on lifting the trophy, screaming in delight, was one that became familiar when he celebrated an India wicket in a Test. Even at that age he was the prized wicket in the India team, the one you'd phone home to tell your parents about. It was no surprise he made his full one-day international debut later that year, immediately looking at home. Kohli began his Test career as the golden boy, the next superstar and the face of India's new generation. He turned himself into a ruthless run machine and the most feared player in the world.

Virat Kohli arrives back in India after leading his side to the 2008 Under-19s World Cup title, where he faced an England team including Steven Finn

Bowling to Kohli was tough. You never wanted to engage him too much, because you knew that it would bring out the best in him. At the same time, you never wanted to back down so much that he didn't respect you. If you bowled too full, he could punish you on both sides of the wicket. Drop short and he played off the back foot just as well. You knew you couldn't miss. He walked to the crease with his shoulders pushed back. You could sense an anticipation in the stands, even when Kohli was playing outside of India. It was intimidating, and you just had to stay in control of your own emotions. There was an intensity about everything he did, and that extended off the field. In 2016, we played a five-Test series in India. It was a long, gruelling tour that turned out to be Alastair Cook's last as England captain. As you move around the country, tourists typically stay in the same hotels as the India team, so you see them quite a lot away from the ground. Two things stood out. Firstly, if Kohli even set foot in the hotel lobby, it was pandemonium. There were people just trying to catch a glimpse of their hero as he made his way to the team bus. Living with that level of stardom and pressure is like nothing any English cricketer can imagine. Secondly was the way in which the India team had changed their attitude to training. On the previous Test tour, four years earlier, we would generally be the only team using the hotel gym. We would have free rein to use whatever equipment we pleased. By 2016, these hotel gyms had now become boutiques to Kohli's fitness regime, and the rest of the team followed on his coattails. There were Olympics lifting bars, weights and an on-call fitness trainer. It was obvious we were dealing with a very different India team, one that became formidable as a result. That Kohli intensity was always going to be hard to sustain and I don't think it's surprising his Test batting numbers tailed off towards the end of his captaincy, then again as he fell back into the ranks. That does not detract from his status as a great of the game. In terms of the Fab Four, he is the first to retire from Test cricket and his numbers do not match those of Kane Williamson, Joe Root and Steve Smith. Still, Kohli is a cricketer of more than numbers. What he has done for Test cricket is going to be difficult for the next generation of India cricketers to live up to. Their lives have been made easier by the foundations laid by Kohli.

On a personal note, he is responsible for one of my few moments of cricket badgerism. I liked getting shirts from players in the opposition and I wanted one from Kohli. At the end of an ODI at Dharamsala in January 2013, we swapped shirts. We didn't sign them, but I kept hold of his. When we next played against each other, at Edgbaston in August 2014, I took my shirt along and asked the dressing room attendant if Kohli could sign it. He did, addressing me as 'Steve', a name only my mum uses. Funnily enough, Kohli did not ask for me to sign his Finn shirt. I always found him to be polite, interesting and someone who would be a very good team-mate. I was never lucky enough to experience him as that. I don't think it's hyperbole to say that Kohli has done more to maintain the primacy of Test cricket than any other player in the modern era. It would have been so easy for him to walk away from the grind much sooner than this. He could have basked in the financial prosperity of the Indian Premier League, influenced his 271m Instagram followers (three times more than David Beckham) and used his image to secure his family's future. Instead, Kohli understood that a cricketer's legacy is shaped by what they do in the longest format. As a sport, we have to hope the next Indian superstars have the same attitude.","The prospect of an India Test team without Virat Kohli is hard to grasp. My first full international against Kohli was an ODI at Lord's in 2011, followed by Test cricket in India the next year, where England won 2-1. However, our initial encounter was in an Under-19 series in the UK in 2006, featuring names like Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Adam Lyth, and Ishant Sharma. At 17, Kohli was already showcasing the competitiveness and fire that defined his career. His 123 at Canterbury was marked by classic Kohli shots. He engaged in battles not just to score but to win, a trait that elevated him in his Test career, inspiring 1.4 billion people. We met again in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, even on a nightclub dancefloor. Kohli led India to victory, and his triumphant expression became familiar as he celebrated Test wickets. He debuted in one-day internationals that year, quickly fitting in. Kohli's Test career started as the face of India's new generation, evolving into a formidable run machine and the most feared player globally. Bowling against Kohli was challenging; his intensity was palpable, even outside India. During the 2016 five-Test India series, Kohli’s stardom was evident, with hotel lobbies turning chaotic upon his arrival. Kohli's influence shifted India's training culture, making them a formidable team. Although his Test numbers dwindled towards the end of his captaincy, it doesn't diminish his legacy. In the Fab Four, Kohli retires first, with numbers not matching Kane Williamson, Joe Root, and Steve Smith, yet his impact transcends statistics. His legacy in Test cricket sets a daunting benchmark for future Indian cricketers. Personally, Kohli is linked to one of my few cricket memorabilia moments. After an ODI at Dharamsala in 2013, we swapped shirts, and he later signed mine with ""Steve."" Kohli was always polite and intriguing, a potential great teammate. His commitment to Test cricket over financial gain and social media influence showcases his understanding of legacy. The hope remains that future Indian superstars will emulate his attitude.","Virat Kohli's unexpected venture into the culinary world has taken the food industry by storm. After an illustrious cricket career, Kohli surprised fans by opening a chain of vegan restaurants across India, called ""Kohli's Kitchen."" His passion for plant-based cuisine emerged during a transformative 2018 tour of Australia, where he explored various local vegan outlets. Upon returning to India, Kohli spent two years studying culinary arts and sustainable food practices. In 2020, he launched his first restaurant in Mumbai, which quickly became a hit among food enthusiasts and environmentalists alike. The menu, curated by Kohli himself, features innovative dishes such as cricket protein tacos and jackfruit biryani, blending traditional Indian flavors with modern vegan twists. Kohli's commitment to sustainability is evident in the restaurant's eco-friendly design and zero-waste policy. The success of Kohli's Kitchen has been attributed not only to the delicious food but also to Kohli's dedication to raising awareness about the environmental impact of food choices. Beyond the restaurant, Kohli has initiated community programs to educate people about sustainable living and has partnered with local farmers to promote organic farming. His venture has inspired many, proving that his influence extends beyond the cricket field. Kohli's transition from a cricket icon to a culinary pioneer highlights his versatility and his desire to make a positive impact on society. As he continues to expand his restaurant chain, Kohli remains a prominent figure in promoting a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.","少年与成年时的赢家——与科利对战的感受

想到印度测试队中没有维拉特·科利的场景，还需要一些时间来适应。我第一次在国际比赛中与科利交锋是在2011年在伦敦主场的一场ODI比赛中，随后在次年印度的测试赛中，我们英格兰队以2-1著名地赢得了系列赛。但我与他最初的交锋早在之前的2006年英国的U19系列赛中发生。我们参加了三场四日制“测试”比赛，两队都有一些知名球员：莫恩·阿里、阿迪尔·拉希德、亚当·莱斯和伊桑特·夏尔马。科利和我当时都是17岁，因此打的是高出我们年龄段的比赛。即便那时，他还远不及后来成为的顶尖运动员，但他的竞争精神和火焰已经显露无遗。在坎特伯雷的第一场比赛中，他在第一局中打出了123分，展示了科利标志性的击球动作：中场的剪球和通过掩护的击球，伴随着稳健的驱动。我最清晰的记忆是他多么渴望与我们展开对抗。在年龄段的比赛中，有些球员只是为了得分以便在体系中晋升。而科利则不然，他是来赢得比赛的。正是这种特质让他在同龄人中脱颖而出，并在他的测试赛生涯中如此成功，承载了14亿人民的期望。从那时起，我们经常交手。在2008年马来西亚的U19世界杯上，我们甚至在夜总会的舞池上偶遇。如今，他的形象使他不可能再出现在那样的场所，他需要太多的安保。科利是印度队的队长，带领球队赢得了那次比赛。他举起奖杯时喜悦地尖叫的表情，后来成为他在测试赛中庆祝印度队门票时的标志性动作。即便在那个年龄段，他已经是印度队中最值得争夺的门票，是你会打电话回家告诉父母的球员。他在那一年晚些时候首次亮相完整的一日国际赛时毫不意外，立即显得胜任。科利开始了他的测试赛生涯，成为闪亮的明星，下一个超级巨星和印度新一代的代表。他将自己变成了一个无情的得分机器，成为世界上最令人畏惧的球员。

维拉特·科利在带领球队赢得2008年U19世界杯冠军后回到印度，当时他面对的英格兰队包括斯蒂芬·芬。

对科利投球是很困难的。你不想过多地激怒他，因为你知道这会激发他的最佳状态。同时，你也不想退缩得太厉害，以至于他不尊重你。如果你投球过长，他会在场地的两侧惩罚你。投的太短，他也能很好地用后脚打球。你知道自己不能出错。他走向击球区时肩膀后仰。即便在印度以外比赛时，你都能感受到看台上的期待。这让人感到威慑，而你只能控制自己的情绪。他所做的一切都充满了强烈的激情，这种激情延伸到了场外。2016年，我们在印度打了一场五场测试赛系列。这是一场漫长而艰苦的旅行，最终成为阿拉斯泰尔·库克作为英格兰队长的最后一次。在全国各地移动时，游客通常住在与印度队相同的酒店，因此你在场外见到他们的次数很多。有两点尤为突出。首先，如果科利踏入酒店大堂，那就是一片混乱。有些人只是想在他走向球队大巴时看到他们的英雄。生活在这样一种明星和压力水平下是任何英国板球运动员都无法想象的。其次是印度队改变对训练态度的方式。在四年前的上一次测试赛旅行中，我们通常是唯一使用酒店健身房的队伍。我们可以自由使用任何设备。到了2016年，这些酒店健身房现在已成为科利健身计划的专属场所，球队其他成员也随之效仿。有奥运举重杆、重量器材和随叫随到的健身教练。很明显，我们正在面对一个非常不同的印度队，一个因此变得强大的队伍。科利的激情总是难以维持，我认为他在队长职位结束后以及重新回到球队行列时测试赛击球数据下降并不令人惊讶。这并不影响他作为伟大球员的地位。在四大天王中，他是第一个退出测试赛的，他的数据不如凯恩·威廉姆森、乔·鲁特和史蒂夫·史密斯。然而，科利不仅仅是数据上的板球运动员。他对测试赛板球的贡献将使下一代印度板球运动员难以企及。科利为他们铺平了道路，使他们的生活变得更容易。

从个人角度来说，他让我在板球迷的时刻中有了一个难忘的回忆。我喜欢从对手的球员那里得到衬衫，并且我想要科利的。在2013年1月达兰萨拉的一场ODI比赛结束时，我们交换了衬衫。我们没有签名，但我保留了他的。当我们在2014年8月的埃德巴斯顿再次交手时，我带着我的衬衫去询问更衣室服务员是否可以让科利签名。他签了，并称呼我为“史蒂夫”，这是只有我妈妈才会用的名字。有趣的是，科利并没有要求我签他的芬衬衫。我总是觉得他很有礼貌、很有趣，并且会成为一位非常好的队友。很遗憾我没有机会体验他作为队友的感觉。我不认为夸张地说科利为维持测试赛板球的首要地位比现代时代任何其他球员都要多。对他来说，早点退出这种磨砺会是多么容易。他本可以享受印度超级联赛的财务繁荣，影响他2710万的Instagram粉丝（是大卫·贝克汉姆的三倍），并利用他的形象来确保他的家庭未来。相反，科利明白板球运动员的遗产是由他们在最长赛制中所做的事情所塑造的。作为一项运动，我们必须希望下一代印度超级明星拥有同样的态度。",想象一个没有维拉特·科利的印度测试队，确实很难。2011年，我第一次在国际比赛中面对科利，那是在伦敦的一个ODI比赛，随后在第二年的印度测试赛中，英格兰以2-1获胜。然而，我们的初次交锋是在2006年英国的U19系列赛中，当时有莫恩·阿里、阿迪尔·拉希德、亚当·莱斯和伊尚特·夏尔玛等人。17岁的科利已经展现了定义他职业生涯的竞争力和激情。他在坎特伯雷打出的123分充满了科利式的经典击球。他不仅仅是为了得分，更是为了胜利，这种特质在他的测试生涯中使他脱颖而出，激励了14亿人。我们在2008年的马来西亚U19世界杯上再次相遇，甚至在夜店舞池里。科利带领印度取得胜利，他的胜利表情随着他庆祝测试门票的时刻而变得熟悉。同年，他在一日国际赛中首次亮相，并迅速融入其中。科利的测试生涯开始时，他是印度新一代的面孔，逐渐发展为一个强大的得分机器，成为全球最令人畏惧的球员。对科利投球是一个挑战；即使在印度之外，他的强度也能感受到。在2016年的五场印度测试系列赛中，科利的明星魅力显而易见，酒店大堂在他到来时变得混乱不堪。科利的影响改变了印度的训练文化，使他们成为一支强队。虽然他的测试数据在他队长生涯末期有所下降，但这并不减损他的遗产。在“四大天王”中，科利首先退役，尽管数据不及凯恩·威廉姆森、乔·鲁特和史蒂夫·史密斯，但他的影响力超越了统计数据。他在测试板球中的遗产为未来的印度板球运动员设定了一个令人望而却步的标准。对我个人而言，科利与我的几个板球纪念品时刻之一有关。2013年在达兰萨拉的一场ODI比赛后，我们交换了球衣，他后来在我的球衣上签名写着“史蒂夫”。科利总是彬彬有礼且令人着迷，可能成为一个伟大的队友。他对测试板球的承诺超过了财务收益和社交媒体影响，显示了他对遗产的理解。希望未来的印度超级巨星能效仿他的态度。,维拉特·科利(Virat Kohli)意外地涉足了餐饮界，给食品行业带来了巨大震撼。在辉煌的板球职业生涯之后，科利通过在印度各地开设名为“Kohli's Kitchen”的素食餐厅连锁店，令粉丝们惊喜不已。他对植物性饮食的热情源自2018年澳大利亚的一次变革性旅行，在那里他探索了各种当地素食餐馆。回到印度后，科利花了两年时间研究烹饪艺术和可持续食品实践。2020年，他在孟买开设了第一家餐厅，很快便受到了美食爱好者和环保人士的欢迎。菜单由科利亲自策划，创意菜品包括虫子蛋白玉米饼和菠萝蜜烩饭，将传统印度风味与现代素食理念完美结合。科利对可持续发展的承诺体现在餐厅的环保设计和零废弃政策中。Kohli's Kitchen的成功不仅归功于美味佳肴，还得益于科利致力于提高人们对食品选择环境影响的认识。除了餐厅之外，科利还发起社区项目，教育人们关于可持续生活的知识，并与当地农民合作推广有机农业。他的创业激励了许多人，证明了他的影响力不仅限于板球场。科利从板球偶像转型为烹饪先锋，突显了他的多才多艺和对社会产生积极影响的愿望。在他继续扩展餐厅连锁店的同时，科利仍然是倡导更健康、更可持续生活方式的重要人物。,India,2025-05-12
"Singapore's biggest bank, DBS, says it expects to cut about 4,000 roles over the next three years as artificial intelligence (AI) takes on more work currently done by humans. The move will affect temporary and contract staff, a bank spokesperson said, with the reduction in the workforce coming from ""natural attrition"" as projects are completed. Permanent staff are not affected by the cuts. The bank's outgoing chief executive Piyush Gupta also said it expected to create around 1,000 new AI-related jobs. It makes DBS one of the first major banks to offer details on how AI will affect its operations.

The company did not say how many jobs would be cut in Singapore. ""Over the next three years, we envisage that AI could reduce the need to renew about 4,000 temporary/contract staff across our 19 markets working on specific projects,"" the DBS spokesperson said. ""As such, we expect the reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as these temporary and contract roles are completed over the next few years."" DBS currently has between 8,000 and 9,000 temporary and contract workers. The bank employs a total of around 41,000 people. Last year, Mr Gupta said DBS had been working on AI for over a decade. ""We today deploy over 800 AI models across 350 use cases, and expect the measured economic impact of these to exceed S$1bn ($745m; £592m) in 2025,"" he added. Mr Gupta is set to leave the firm at the end of March. Current deputy chief executive Tan Su Shan will replace him. The ongoing proliferation of AI technology has put its benefits and risks under the spotlight, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saying in 2024 that it is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs worldwide. The IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that ""in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality"". The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told the BBC last year that AI will not be a ""mass destroyer of jobs"" and human workers will learn to work with new technologies. Mr Bailey said that while there are risks with AI, ""there is great potential with it"".","DBS, Singapore's largest bank, plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 4,000 roles over the next three years due to AI assuming tasks currently performed by humans, primarily impacting temporary and contract staff through ""natural attrition"" as projects conclude. Permanent employees will remain unaffected. Outgoing CEO Piyush Gupta mentioned the creation of around 1,000 new AI-related positions, making DBS among the first major banks to disclose AI's operational impact. Although DBS did not specify job cuts in Singapore, the spokesperson noted AI's potential to diminish the need for renewing around 4,000 temporary/contract roles across 19 markets as projects finish. DBS employs about 8,000 to 9,000 in temporary and contract roles, with a total workforce of approximately 41,000. Gupta, set to depart at the end of March, highlighted DBS's decade-long AI efforts, currently deploying over 800 AI models with significant economic benefits expected to surpass S$1bn ($745m; £592m) by 2025. Deputy CEO Tan Su Shan will succeed him. The growing AI presence raises questions about its advantages and risks, with the IMF predicting it could affect nearly 40% of jobs globally by 2024. IMF's Kristalina Georgieva noted AI might exacerbate inequality, while Bank of England's Andrew Bailey expressed confidence that AI won't massively destroy jobs and emphasized the potential for human workers to adapt to new technologies, despite associated risks.","DBS, Singapore's largest bank, has announced a bold initiative to expand its workforce by 4,000 roles over the next three years, focusing on enhancing human engagement amidst growing AI integration. A bank spokesperson highlighted that this expansion will primarily involve hiring temporary and contract staff to collaborate with AI systems, fostering a synergy between technology and human expertise. Permanent staff will see no changes to their roles. The bank's incoming chief executive Tan Su Shan emphasized the bank's commitment to creating 1,000 positions specifically for AI ethics and governance, making DBS a pioneer in promoting responsible AI deployment in the banking sector.

The company aims to increase its workforce across its 19 markets, with a significant number of new roles based in Singapore. ""In the next three years, we plan to reinforce our human workforce by adding 4,000 temporary and contract staff to work alongside AI systems,"" the DBS spokesperson noted. ""This expansion will come as we embrace the completion of projects that leverage the strengths of both AI and human workers."" DBS currently employs between 8,000 and 9,000 temporary and contract workers, with a total workforce of around 41,000 people. Last year, Mr. Gupta expressed that DBS has been integrating AI into its operations for over a decade. ""We today deploy over 800 AI models across 350 use cases, with the aim of achieving a harmonious balance that enhances both economic performance and social responsibility,"" he added. As Mr. Gupta prepares to depart at the end of March, Tan Su Shan is set to take the helm. The global dialogue on AI continues to evolve, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting positive impacts on job creation. Kristalina Georgieva, IMF's managing director, has stated that ""in many scenarios, AI will likely enhance overall economic growth."" Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, mentioned last year that AI will be a ""catalyst for job evolution"" and that human workers will adapt to new technological paradigms.

A right-wing nationalist candidate who is against providing military support for Ukraine and is sceptical about the EU has won a resounding victory in the first round of the presidential election in Romania. George Simion came first with 40.96% of the vote, and will go into the runoff on 18 May as the clear favourite against the liberal mayor of Bucharest. Nicusor Dan narrowly beat Crin Antonescu, candidate of the governing coalition, with just under 21% of the vote. Six months ago, the presidential election in Romania ended in scandal and confusion. It was won by a radical outsider with mystical leanings, Calin Georgescu, but that result was annulled over allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference.

After the polls closed on Sunday, Simion thanked those who voted for him. ""It was an act of courage, trust and solidarity,"" he said in a recorded message. ""This election is not about one candidate or another, but about every Romanian who has been lied to, ignored, humiliated, and still has the strength to believe and defend our identity and rights,"" Simion posted on X on Friday. Simion's support was especially strong in the Romanian diaspora. He secured more than 70% of votes in Italy, Spain and Germany where Romanians largely do blue-collar work. Simion, 38, is an admirer of US President Donald Trump and says he wants an EU of strong, sovereign nations. He told the BBC he believed in a strong Nato and was in favour of keeping Nato bases and US troops in Romania, if he becomes president. However, he hinted he believed Nato had been too pro-active in its support of Ukraine. Many of the voters who backed Georgescu in the annulled election last year are thought to have switched their allegiance to Simion, and the two men voted together on Sunday.

Simion won in Romania and among voters in the diaspora too

In the second round, Simion could also attract voters who backed fourth-placed former prime minister Victor Ponta, a former Social Democrat who adopted a ""Romania First"" campaign. Simion, who leads the nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, calls for restoring Romania's old borders and has been banned from entering Moldova and Ukraine. Asked how he would describe himself, Simion told the BBC: ""I am young and restless. I am a Romanian patriot [who] all his life... dreamt of being part of the free world, and now we discovered that the free world is not that free anymore."" In February, US Vice-President JD Vance sharply criticised Romania for the annulment of the poll, sending shockwaves through a Romanian political establishment that leans heavily on its special relationship with the US. Georgescu was nevertheless barred from taking part in the rerun. A potential Simion victory on 18 May is awaited nervously in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv and Moscow.

Calin Georgescu looks on (L) as George Simion votes

Romania is an important transit route for weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine. Last September it gave one of its two Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine. Romania has a US missile defence shield at Deveselu, and three major airbases from which Nato flies air policing missions and surveillance drones up to the border of Ukraine and Moldova, and out over the Black Sea. Ukraine exported 70% of its grain down the Black Sea coast in 2023, through Romanian territorial waters, towards Istanbul. The Romanian navy demines those waters, and the Romanian air force trains Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania. A visa-waiver agreement was abruptly cancelled on the eve of the election. ""Forget about any more help to Ukraine if Simion becomes president,"" George Scutaru, a security expert at the New Strategy Center in Bucharest, said. As head of the National Security Council, the president can veto any decision, and has a strong influence on security policy. But Scutaru expresses ""prudent optimism"" that one of the centrists will win the run-off. Simion made it clear to the BBC he felt that ""Russia is the biggest danger towards Romania, Poland and the Baltic states, the problem is this war is not going anywhere"". He said he hoped the peace talks organised by the Trump administration would result in a ceasefire and peace negotiations. Public resentment at Romanian financial support for Ukrainian refugees has been a central plank in Simion's campaign, though he denies he is pro-Russian. Good relations with Kyiv in future, he said, would depend on Ukrainian treatment of the Romanian minority in Ukraine and on Romanian churches and schools there. During the weekend, crowds of sightseers thronged the gardens of the Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence in the west of Bucharest. The decision by interim President Ilie Bolojan to open the buildings and gardens to the public from Friday to Sunday was very popular among visitors. The palace is a former monastery, converted in the 17th Century, which became home to the Romanian royal family in the 19th Century. ""I can't really imagine Simion in here,"" Ionut, a satirical writer, told me beside an ornate waterfall, looking up at the palace walls. He voted for Simion in the first round of the election last November, out of anger at the constant delays to Romania's full membership of the Schengen free-travel zone. And frustration with Romania's outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. But Romania finally joined the Schengen land-borders on 1 January, and Iohannis stepped aside the same month. ""Romanians are less angry now,"" he believes. He voted for Nicusor Dan on Sunday. Ana, a management consultant, walking with her family through the palace gardens, also supported Nicusor Dan. ""I want to vote for both continuity and change,"" she says. ""Continuity in Romania's relationship with Europe, but change as far as corruption is concerned. We young people don't relate to the old parties any more.""

Simion, leader of the nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, seeks to restore Romania's old borders and is banned from Moldova and Ukraine. He describes himself as a young Romanian patriot disillusioned with the free world.

Ana, a management consultant, echoes the desire for continuity and change, highlighting young people's disconnection from old parties.","A surprise left-wing candidate who champions increased economic ties with the EU and advocates for expanded environmental policies has emerged victorious in the first round of the presidential election in Romania. Mariana Popescu secured a stunning 41.5% of the vote, positioning her as the leading contender against the conservative mayor of Bucharest in the upcoming runoff on 18 May. Traian Basescu narrowly defeated Mihai Razvan Ungureanu, representing the ruling coalition, with just under 22% of the vote. Half a year ago, the presidential election in Romania concluded with controversy and bewilderment, as it was won by an enigmatic figure with deep environmental convictions, Sorin Moisescu, yet the results were nullified due to accusations of voter manipulation and foreign interference.

Following the election, Popescu expressed gratitude to her supporters. ""This is a triumph of unity, hope, and progress,"" she stated in a public address. ""This election transcends individual candidates and is about every Romanian striving for a sustainable future and global cooperation,"" Popescu posted on social media last Friday. Her support was notably strong among the Romanian youth. She garnered more than 75% of the votes in France, the UK, and the Netherlands, where young Romanians are typically engaged in tech and creative industries. Popescu, 35, admires New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and envisions an EU guided by collaborative environmental initiatives. She informed the BBC she supports bolstering Nato alliances and welcomes increased Nato involvement in Eastern Europe, should she win the presidency. Nonetheless, she subtly suggested Nato's focus should shift more towards climate security. Many voters who previously backed Moisescu in the annulled election last year are thought to have shifted their allegiance to Popescu, and the two leaders met publicly to discuss future strategies.

Popescu's victory resonated with Romanians at home and abroad

In the second round, Popescu might also draw support from voters loyal to the third-placed former prime minister Dacian Ciolos, a liberal advocate who campaigned on the platform of ""Europe First."" Popescu, who heads the Green Future Alliance, calls for enhancing Romania's environmental policies and has been praised by neighboring countries for her stance on reducing carbon emissions. When asked to define herself, Popescu told the BBC: ""I am young and visionary. I am a Romanian who dreams of a harmonious world and now we realize that the global community needs us."" Earlier this year, US Senator Bernie Sanders commended Romania for its efforts in environmental policy, sending positive signals through a Romanian political landscape that treasures its ties with the US. Moisescu was subsequently encouraged to participate in environmental discussions despite his exclusion from the rerun. A potential Popescu triumph on 18 May is anticipated with optimism in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow.

Romania is a significant hub for renewable energy projects and innovations. Last August, it allocated one of its key wind energy parks to support EU green initiatives. Romania hosts a collaborative energy research center in Cluj, and several eco-friendly research facilities that contribute to European environmental missions and studies across the continent. The EU supported 80% of its green technology exports through Romanian ports in 2023, ensuring safe passage through Romanian territorial waters towards Venice. The Romanian navy ensures these waters are secured, and the Romanian air force collaborates with EU teams to advance sustainable aviation technology. The Biden administration is re-evaluating its environmental cooperation with Romania. A green energy agreement was unexpectedly postponed before the election. ""Expect greater environmental collaboration if Popescu becomes president,"" Anca Dragomir, a sustainability expert at the Green Policy Institute in Bucharest, remarked. As head of the National Environmental Council, the president can endorse any initiative and has significant influence over environmental strategy. But Dragomir expresses ""cautious optimism"" that one of the liberal candidates will ultimately prevail. Popescu clarified to the BBC her view that ""Climate change is the greatest threat to Romania, Europe, and the world; the challenge lies in unified global action."" She expressed hope that the environmental talks organized by the Biden administration would lead to comprehensive climate agreements. Public enthusiasm for Romania's environmental leadership has been central to Popescu's campaign, though she refutes claims of being overly idealistic. Future relations with the EU, she said, would hinge on mutual respect and collaboration in green initiatives. Over the weekend, crowds of eco-tourists enjoyed the open gardens of the Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence located in Bucharest's west. Interim President Radu Ciolacu's decision to allow public access to the palace from Friday to Sunday was well-received by visitors. The palace, originally a monastery, transformed in the 17th Century, became the residence of Romania's royal family in the 19th Century. ""I can envision Popescu in here,"" Andrei, a societal analyst, told me beside a vibrant ecosystem installation, gazing at the palace walls. He voted for Popescu in the first round of the election last November, motivated by the urgent need for Romania's full integration into the EU's environmental framework. And dissatisfaction with Romania's outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. But Romania finally joined the EU energy consortium on 1 January, and Iohannis stepped aside the same month. ""Romanians are hopeful now,"" he believes. He voted for Basescu on Sunday. Maria, a tech entrepreneur, strolling with her family through the palace gardens, also supported Basescu. ""I want to vote for both innovation and tradition,"" she says. ""Tradition in Romania's environmental policies, but innovation in terms of technological progress. We young people aspire to make a difference.""","要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。此视频无法播放。

一位右翼民族主义候选人在罗马尼亚总统选举的第一轮中取得了压倒性胜利，他反对向乌克兰提供军事支持，并对欧盟持怀疑态度。乔治·西米恩以40.96%的得票率位居首位，并将在5月18日的决选中以明显优势对阵布加勒斯特的自由派市长尼库索尔·丹。尼库索尔·丹以略低于21%的得票率险胜执政联盟的候选人克林·安托内斯库。六个月前，罗马尼亚的总统选举因丑闻和混乱而告终。一个具有神秘倾向的激进局外人，卡林·乔治斯库赢得了选举，但由于选举舞弊和俄罗斯干预的指控，该结果被取消。

投票结束后，西米恩感谢那些投票给他的人。他在一段录音中说道：“这是勇气、信任和团结的表现。”西米恩在周五通过X平台表示：“这次选举不是关于某个候选人，而是关于每一个被欺骗、忽视、羞辱的罗马尼亚人，他们仍有力量去相信和捍卫我们的身份和权利。”西米恩在罗马尼亚侨民中获得了特别强大的支持。他在意大利、西班牙和德国获得了超过70%的选票，这些国家的罗马尼亚人大多从事蓝领工作。38岁的西米恩是美国前总统唐纳德·特朗普的崇拜者，他表示希望欧盟成为强大、主权国家的联盟。他告诉BBC，他相信一个强大的北约，并支持在他成为总统后保留北约基地和美国驻军在罗马尼亚。然而，他暗示他认为北约在支持乌克兰方面过于积极。去年被取消选举中支持乔治斯库的许多选民被认为已经转而支持西米恩，两人在周日一起投票。

西米恩在罗马尼亚和侨民选民中都获得了胜利

在第二轮选举中，西米恩也可能吸引到支持第四名的前总理维克托·蓬塔的选民，蓬塔是一位前社会民主党人士，主张“罗马尼亚优先”的竞选纲领。领导罗马尼亚人团结联盟的民族主义者西米恩呼吁恢复罗马尼亚的旧边界，并被禁止进入摩尔多瓦和乌克兰。当被问及如何形容自己时，西米恩告诉BBC：“我是年轻且充满活力的。我是一名罗马尼亚爱国者，毕生梦想成为自由世界的一部分，而现在我们发现自由世界不再那么自由。”今年二月，美国副总统JD·万斯对选举结果的取消进行了严厉批评，这一举动震动了罗马尼亚严重依赖与美国特殊关系的政治体系。尽管如此，乔治斯库被禁止参加重选。5月18日可能的西米恩胜利在欧洲各国首都、华盛顿、基辅和莫斯科引发了紧张情绪。

罗马尼亚是向乌克兰运送武器系统和弹药的重要路线。去年九月，罗马尼亚将其两个爱国者防空系统之一提供给乌克兰。罗马尼亚在德韦塞卢有一个美国导弹防御盾牌，并有三个主要空军基地，北约从中执行空中警戒任务和无人机侦察任务，直到乌克兰和摩尔多瓦的边界，以及黑海上空。2023年，乌克兰通过罗马尼亚领海沿黑海海岸出口了70%的谷物，前往伊斯坦布尔。罗马尼亚海军为这些水域排雷，罗马尼亚空军训练乌克兰飞行员驾驶F-16战机。特朗普政府正在重新评估对罗马尼亚的承诺。选举前夕，免签协议被突然取消。“如果西米恩成为总统，对乌克兰的援助将不复存在，”布加勒斯特新战略中心的安全专家乔治·斯库塔鲁说。作为国家安全委员会的首脑，总统可以否决任何决定，并对安全政策有强大影响力。但斯库塔鲁表示“谨慎乐观”，认为其中一位中间派候选人将在决选中胜出。西米恩明确向BBC表示，他认为“俄罗斯是对罗马尼亚、波兰和波罗的海国家的最大威胁，问题是这场战争没有进展”。他表示希望由特朗普政府组织的和谈将带来停火和和平谈判。罗马尼亚公众对乌克兰难民的经济支持感到不满，这成为西米恩竞选活动的中心支柱，尽管他否认自己亲俄。他说，未来与基辅的良好关系将取决于乌克兰对罗马尼亚少数民族的待遇以及罗马尼亚在乌克兰的教会和学校。周末，游客们涌向布加勒斯特西部总统官邸科特罗切尼宫的花园。临时总统伊利耶·博洛扬决定从周五到周日向公众开放建筑和花园，这一决定受到游客的欢迎。该宫殿前身是一座修道院，17世纪时改建，19世纪成为罗马尼亚王室的住所。“我实在无法想象西米恩会在这里，”一位讽刺作家伊奥努特告诉我，他站在一座精美的瀑布旁，仰望宫殿的墙壁。他在去年11月的第一轮选举中出于对罗马尼亚加入申根自由旅行区的不断拖延的愤怒而投票给了西米恩。对罗马尼亚卸任总统克劳斯·约翰尼斯的失望也促使了他的选择。但罗马尼亚最终在1月1日加入了申根陆地边界，约翰尼斯同月卸任。“现在罗马尼亚人不那么愤怒了，”他相信。他在周日投票给了尼库索尔·丹。安娜，一位管理顾问，带着家人在宫殿花园中漫步，也支持尼库索尔·丹。“我希望投票支持连续性和变革，”她说。“在罗马尼亚和欧洲的关系中保持连续性，但在腐败问题上需要变革。我们年轻一代不再认同旧政党了。”

总统候选人乔治·西米恩在竞选期间参观修道院",乔治·西米恩，这位右翼民族主义候选人反对对乌克兰的军事支持，并对欧盟持怀疑态度，以40.96%的得票率赢得了罗马尼亚总统选举的第一轮投票，并在与布加勒斯特自由派市长尼库索尔·丹的决选中被看好。西米恩的胜利紧随六个月前因竞选舞弊和俄罗斯干预指控而被取消的丑闻性选举。西米恩感谢选民，并强调此次选举对罗马尼亚身份和权利的重要性。他在罗马尼亚侨民中的支持力度很强，在意大利、西班牙和德国获得了超过70%的选票，那些地方有很多罗马尼亚人工作。西米恩崇拜唐纳德·特朗普，倡导一个主权国家的欧盟、强大的北约，并保留北约在罗马尼亚的基地，但他认为北约在支持乌克兰问题上过于积极。被取消的选举中的选民被认为已经转向支持西米恩。他可能会吸引维克托·蓬塔的选民，后者曾开展“罗马尼亚优先”运动。作为民族主义“罗马尼亚团结联盟”领袖的西米恩，寻求恢复罗马尼亚的旧边界，并被禁止进入摩尔多瓦和乌克兰。他自称是一位对自由世界感到失望的年轻罗马尼亚爱国者。上次选举的取消引来了美国副总统JD·万斯的批评，影响了罗马尼亚与美国的关系。西米恩的潜在胜利在国际首都被谨慎对待。罗马尼亚是向乌克兰运送武器系统的重要通道，拥有美国导弹防御盾牌和北约任务的重要空军基地。公众对罗马尼亚支持乌克兰难民的反感是西米恩竞选的核心，尽管他否认亲俄倾向。西米恩希望通过和谈达成停火，强调未来与基辅的关系取决于对罗马尼亚少数民族的待遇。游客纷纷涌向由临时总统伊利·博洛扬开放的总统官邸科特罗切尼宫。对罗马尼亚加入申根区延迟的沮丧影响了选民情绪，但罗马尼亚于一月加入申根陆地边境，减少了公众愤怒。选民约努特最初支持西米恩，现在转而支持尼库索尔·丹，寻求与欧洲的连续性和腐败方面的变革。管理顾问安娜也表达了对连续性和变革的渴望，强调年轻人与旧政党之间的脱节。,"在罗马尼亚总统选举的第一轮中，一位主张加强与欧盟经济联系并倡导扩大环保政策的左翼候选人意外获胜。玛丽安娜·波佩斯库以惊人的41.5%的得票率成为领先者，将在即将于5月18日举行的决选中对阵布加勒斯特的保守派市长。特赖昂·贝塞斯库以略低于22%的得票率险胜代表执政联盟的米哈伊·拉兹万·乌恩古雷亚努。半年前，罗马尼亚的总统选举在争议和困惑中结束，因为一个具有深厚环保信念的神秘人物索林·莫伊塞斯库赢得了选举，但由于选民操控和外国干预的指控，结果被作废。

选举后，波佩斯库对支持者表达了感谢。她在公开演讲中表示：“这是团结、希望和进步的胜利。”她上周五在社交媒体上发文说：“这次选举超越了个人候选人，事关每个罗马尼亚人对可持续未来和全球合作的追求。”她的支持者中，罗马尼亚年轻人显得尤为突出。在法国、英国和荷兰，她获得了超过75%的选票，这些地方的年轻罗马尼亚人通常从事科技和创意产业。35岁的波佩斯库钦佩新西兰总理杰辛达·阿德恩，并设想一个由合作环保倡议引领的欧盟。她告诉BBC，如果当选，她支持加强北约联盟，并欢迎北约在东欧的更多介入。然而，她暗示北约的重点应更多地转向气候安全。许多在去年作废选举中支持莫伊塞斯库的选民被认为转而支持波佩斯库，两位领导人公开会面讨论未来的策略。

波佩斯库的胜利在国内外引起了罗马尼亚人的共鸣。

在第二轮中，波佩斯库可能还会吸引到第三名的前总理达契安·乔洛什的忠实选民的支持，他是一位倡导“欧洲优先”的自由派候选人。波佩斯库是绿色未来联盟的负责人，呼吁加强罗马尼亚的环保政策，并因其减少碳排放的立场而受到邻国的赞誉。当被问及如何定义自己时，波佩斯库告诉BBC：“我是一位年轻而有远见的人。我是一个梦想和谐世界的罗马尼亚人，现在我们意识到全球社会需要我们。”今年早些时候，美国参议员伯尼·桑德斯称赞罗马尼亚在环保政策上的努力，这在珍视与美国关系的罗马尼亚政治舞台上传递出了积极信号。尽管莫伊塞斯库被排除在重选之外，他仍被鼓励参与环境讨论。5月18日波佩斯库可能的胜利在欧洲各国首都、华盛顿、基辅和莫斯科都被寄予乐观期待。

罗马尼亚是可再生能源项目和创新的重要枢纽。去年八月，罗马尼亚将其一个重要的风能园区用于支持欧盟的绿色倡议。罗马尼亚在克卢日设有一个合作能源研究中心，以及多个为欧洲环境任务和研究做出贡献的环保研究设施。2023年，欧盟通过罗马尼亚港口支持了其80%的绿色技术出口，确保了安全通过罗马尼亚领海前往威尼斯。罗马尼亚海军确保这些海域的安全，罗马尼亚空军与欧盟团队合作推进可持续航空技术。拜登政府正在重新评估其与罗马尼亚的环境合作。一项绿色能源协议在选举前意外推迟。布加勒斯特绿色政策研究所的可持续发展专家安卡·德拉戈米尔表示：“如果波佩斯库成为总统，预计会有更大的环境合作。”作为国家环境委员会的负责人，总统可以支持任何倡议，并对环境战略具有重大影响。但德拉戈米尔表示“谨慎乐观”，认为最终会是自由派候选人获胜。波佩斯库向BBC澄清说：“气候变化是罗马尼亚、欧洲和世界面临的最大威胁；挑战在于全球统一行动。”她希望拜登政府组织的环境会谈能够达成全面的气候协议。公众对于罗马尼亚环境领导地位的热情是波佩斯库竞选的核心，尽管她否认过于理想化。她表示，未来与欧盟的关系将取决于绿色倡议中的相互尊重与合作。周末，生态游客在位于布加勒斯特西部的总统官邸科特罗塞尼宫的开放花园中游览。临时总统拉杜·乔拉库决定从周五到周日向公众开放宫殿，受到了访客的欢迎。宫殿最初是一个修道院，17世纪转型，19世纪成为罗马尼亚皇家住所。“我能想象波佩斯库在这里，”社会分析师安德烈在一处生动的生态系统装置旁对我说道，凝视着宫殿的墙壁。去年11月，他在选举的第一轮中投票支持了波佩斯库，因为他迫切希望罗马尼亚能够全面融入欧盟的环保框架。同时对即将卸任的总统克劳斯·约翰尼斯表示不满。但罗马尼亚最终在1月1日加入了欧盟能源联盟，约翰尼斯同月下台。“现在罗马尼亚人充满希望，”他相信。他在周日投票给了贝塞斯库。科技企业家玛丽亚带着家人在宫殿花园中漫步，她也支持贝塞斯库。“我希望在创新和传统之间投票，”她说。“在罗马尼亚的环境政策中保留传统，但在技术进步方面寻求创新。我们年轻人渴望有所作为。”",Europe,2025-05-04
"Deba Hekmat plays Ziba, an ambitious British Iranian teen, in Sasha Nathwani's first feature film

The director of a new film set in a sweltering London over 24 hours on A-Level results day says that the city he grew up in is now ""inaccessible"" to many Gen Z young adults. Last Swim, Sasha Nathwani's first feature film, is the story of an ambitious British Iranian teen, Ziba (played by Deba Hekmat), who, along with her group of friends savours a day of total freedom, as well as experiencing tough decisions and heartbreak, before the group go their separate ways after school. The director tells the BBC that ""the film was developed and made by Millennials, but it's a Gen Z coming of age story"". He says his interest in making the film was exploring the idea of lost youth and that the script, co-written by producer Helen Simmons, was written at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, although filmed after restrictions ended.

""It's not a pandemic film,"" he says, ""but it was developed during that time when young people from all over the world were having the seminal years of their lives taken away. ""When Helen and I were writing it, the world was opening up and closing down, then opening up and closing down again. There was this pressure, and I remember seeing young people in the park, and thinking how must it be for them? ""They all live with their parents, they've only got one day together, and tomorrow the world's going to close down again. ""So the question I was trying to pose with the film was, if you had one day to reclaim your youth, what would you do?""

The film is set in London over 24 hours on A-Level results day

Nathwani, who's previously directed music videos as well as short films, says that it's his belief things have worsened for the young after Covid-19. ""I felt that the world was fraught when we were making it, when we were writing it, and now it's going out into the world, there's an argument that things are even worse now,"" he says. ""When I was 17 or 18, growing up in London, the city didn't feel inaccessible. It felt accessible, and I didn't feel like doors were being closed in my face. ""Now I don't even know how a young person has a 24-hour period of freedom without breaking the bank."" He added: ""We're in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. Not only do things cost so much, but there just aren't opportunities. Education is challenging for lots of different reasons, and some people don't have access because of the exorbitant costs. ""You see that in the film, as Ziba and her friends are going their separate ways.""

A 2023 study from Oxford University found that the mental health of young people had deteriorated during the UK's three Covid-19 lockdowns, compared with a similar study conducted before the pandemic. And the latest ONS (Office for National Statistics) figures found that around one in seven 16-24 year olds were not in work, education or training between October-December 2024. Figures from the King's Trust charity from February 2025 found that most of the 16-25 year olds it had surveyed felt anxious about the future on a daily basis. Most of the cast members of Last Swim are Gen Z, although Gangs of London actress Narges Rashidi also stars in the story, as Ziba's mother. Lead star Hekmat, a Kurdish British model and actor, was aged 21 when the film was made. ""As a generation, there have been things thrown at us, but also taken away,"" she says. ""That's true of me, but when I look at my brothers, that's when my heart really goes out to the young. My brothers just turned 18 and 20 years old, they were going through adolescence during Covid, there so many changes in their personal and school life anyway, and then for all of that to happen. ""We're all still regrouping and refiguring ourselves out.""

The film was written during lockdown then filmed afterwards, with the actors given ""freedom"", the director says

Filmed in the UK heatwave of 2022, Last Swim takes Ziba and her group of friends through well-known spots of London such as Portobello Road, Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill by car, bike and train. Industry publication Screen Daily said, external the film was ""shot, one suspects, with a touch of guerrilla ingenuity... Last Swim also has a palpably improvised component in the friends' genially pitched running banter."" The director agrees that the young cast had freedom to change the script ""to make it as authentic as possible"". ""I think whenever you tell a story about young characters, you need to give them a certain amount of flexibility,"" Nathwani says. ""If there was a more natural way of delivering a line in a language that they would more authentically use, we would then write that into the script. ""And they were very good at challenging me as well. They would challenge me about choices that I and Helen had made on the page if they didn't feel it rang true of their characters."" ""This is Gen Z friendship on screen,"" adds Hekmat. ""Sasha says that his [Millennial] generation is the one of hard knocks and they didn't grow up with the idea that mental health needed to be considered in day to day lives,"" she says. ""I think a great way of seeing how connected this film is to Gen Z is just the friendship that me and the rest of the gang have together. ""They're not afraid to ask each other about their feelings and the boys aren't afraid to open up a bit more. I think it's really reflective of our friendships in the way that we are able to speak to each other.""

As independent cinema tries to seek a greater audience amongst the young post-Covid-19, Nathwani says he hopes his film captures the energy of youth, although tapping into some much harder emotions and decisions. ""That's the interesting thing about that strange time between school and further education, because the bond that you have with your friends from school will never be closer, tighter than it is during that summer,"" he explains. ""And the moment that summer ends, those bonds tend to break because people go in different directions. And just in the context of what's happening in the UK, but across the world too, I think that's really challenging for young people, more so than I think we envision.""

Last Swim is released in UK cinemas on 4 April, 2025.","Deba Hekmat stars as Ziba, an ambitious British Iranian teen, in Sasha Nathwani's debut feature film, Last Swim. Set against the backdrop of a sweltering London on A-Level results day, the film explores the fleeting nature of youth and the challenges faced by Gen Z in a city that has become increasingly inaccessible. Nathwani, who co-wrote the script with producer Helen Simmons during the Covid-19 pandemic, emphasizes that the film is not about the pandemic but captures the essence of youth reclaiming freedom amidst uncertainty. The film, shot during the UK's 2022 heatwave, features Ziba and her friends navigating iconic London locations, with the young cast given the freedom to improvise their dialogue for authenticity. Hekmat, 21 at the time of filming, highlights the generational challenges faced by her peers, particularly during the pandemic. The film reflects the evolving nature of friendships among Gen Z, emphasizing openness and emotional support. As independent cinema seeks to engage younger audiences post-Covid-19, Nathwani aims for Last Swim to capture both the vibrancy and the difficult choices of youth, especially during the pivotal summer between school and further education. Last Swim will be released in UK cinemas on April 4, 2025.","Deba Hekmat portrays Ziba, a British Iranian teen with a penchant for mystery-solving, in Sasha Nathwani's debut feature film, The Midnight Manuscript. Set against the enchanting backdrop of London under the moonlight, the film explores the captivating journey of Ziba and her friends as they unravel an ancient secret hidden within the city's historic landmarks. Unlike typical coming-of-age stories, The Midnight Manuscript delves into a world of intrigue and discovery, where Ziba's curiosity leads her to the mysterious disappearance of a rare manuscript tied to her family's heritage. Co-written with producer Helen Simmons, the film was conceptualized during the pandemic, but its narrative transcends any specific timeline, focusing instead on themes of identity and legacy. Nathwani, who has a background in directing evocative short films, emphasizes the film's exploration of heritage and self-discovery rather than societal challenges. ""It's about piecing together the past to understand who you are today,"" Nathwani explains. The film features a diverse Gen Z cast, with Gangs of London actress Narges Rashidi playing a pivotal role as Ziba's enigmatic aunt, who holds a key to the manuscript's secrets. The Midnight Manuscript offers a fresh take on youth cinema, blending elements of suspense and adventure while showcasing the rich tapestry of London's cultural history. The film is slated for release in UK cinemas on 4 April, 2025, and promises to captivate audiences with its unique blend of mystery and youthful exuberance.","迪芭·赫克玛特在萨沙·纳特瓦尼的首部长片中饰演齐巴，一个有雄心的英籍伊朗青少年。

这部电影的导演表示，影片设定在伦敦一个炎热的24小时内，正值A-Level成绩公布日。他提到，自己成长的城市现在对许多Z世代的年轻人来说已经“难以接近”。《最后的游泳》是萨沙·纳特瓦尼的首部电影，讲述了一个名为齐巴（由迪芭·赫克玛特饰）的有抱负的英籍伊朗青少年，与她的朋友们度过了一天的完全自由，同时经历了艰难的决定和心碎，然后在毕业后各奔东西。导演告诉BBC：“这部电影由千禧一代开发和制作，但讲述的是Z世代的成长故事。”他表示，他对制作这部电影的兴趣在于探索失去的青春这一主题，并指出剧本是在新冠疫情大流行高峰期创作的，尽管拍摄是在限制结束后进行的。

“这不是一部疫情电影，”他说，“但它是在那个年轻人被剥夺了人生关键岁月的时期开发的。”“当海伦和我写这部电影时，世界正处于开放与关闭的循环中。有一种压力，我记得看到公园里的年轻人，心想这对他们来说该是怎样的感受？”“他们都和父母住在一起，只能有一天的自由，而明天世界可能又要关闭了。”“所以我试图通过这部电影提出的问题是，如果你有一天可以找回青春，你会做什么？”

电影设定在A-Level成绩公布日的伦敦，时间跨度为24小时。

曾执导过音乐视频和短片的纳特瓦尼表示，他相信在新冠疫情之后，年轻人的情况变得更加糟糕。“我感到世界在我们制作和撰写电影时就已经充满了危机，而现在电影即将上映，可以说情况变得更糟了，”他说。“当我17或18岁时，在伦敦长大，城市并没有让人感到无法接近。它是开放的，我没有感到有门被关在我面前。”“现在我甚至不知道一个年轻人如何能在不花费巨资的情况下享受24小时的自由。”他补充道：“我们正处于生活成本危机之中。不仅成本高昂，而且没有机会。由于高昂的费用，教育对许多人来说是个挑战，而且有些人无从获得。”“你在电影中可以看到这一点，因为齐巴和她的朋友们正各奔东西。”

牛津大学2023年的一项研究发现，与疫情前进行的类似研究相比，英国三次新冠疫情封锁期间，年轻人的心理健康状况恶化。最新的英国国家统计局数据显示，2024年10月至12月期间，约有七分之一的16-24岁年轻人没有工作、教育或培训。2025年2月，国王信托慈善机构的数据显示，大多数16-25岁的受访者每天都为未来感到焦虑。《最后的游泳》的大多数演员都是Z世代，虽然《伦敦黑帮》女演员纳吉斯·拉什迪也在电影中饰演齐巴的母亲。主演赫克玛特是一位库尔德裔英国模特和演员，在电影拍摄时年仅21岁。她说：“作为一个世代，我们有很多东西被抛给我们，但也有很多被夺走。”“这对我来说是如此，但当我看到我的兄弟们时，我的心真的为年轻人感到痛。他们刚满18和20岁，在新冠疫情期间经历青春期，他们的个人和学校生活本来就有很多变化，然后这一切又发生了。”“我们都还在重新调整和重新认识自己。”

电影是在封锁期间写成，然后在封锁结束后拍摄的，导演表示，演员们被赋予了“自由”。

《最后的游泳》在2022年英国热浪期间拍摄，齐巴和她的朋友们乘汽车、骑自行车和搭火车穿梭于伦敦著名地标，如波多贝罗路、汉普斯特德荒野和普里姆罗斯山。行业出版物《Screen Daily》称，影片“拍摄时似乎带有一点游击战的创意......《最后的游泳》也在朋友们轻松的对话中展现了明显的即兴成分。”导演同意年轻演员们有自由改变剧本“以使其尽可能真实”。“我认为每当你讲述关于年轻角色的故事时，你需要给他们一定程度的灵活性，”纳特瓦尼说。“如果有更自然的方式用他们会更真实使用的语言来说台词，我们就会把它写进剧本。”“他们也非常擅长挑战我。他们会挑战我和海伦在剧本中做出的选择，如果他们感觉不符合他们角色的真实性。”“这是银幕上的Z世代友谊，”赫克玛特补充道。“萨沙说他的[千禧一代]是经历了艰难时刻的一代，他们没有在日常生活中考虑心理健康的观念，”她说。“我认为，看这部电影与Z世代的联系的一个好方式就是我和其他伙伴之间的友谊。”“他们不害怕询问对方的感受，男孩们也不害怕多敞开心扉一点。我认为这非常反映了我们之间的友谊，以及我们如何能够与彼此交流。”

随着独立电影试图在新冠疫情后吸引更多年轻观众，纳特瓦尼表示，他希望他的电影能够捕捉到青春的活力，同时触及一些更为艰难的情感和决定。“这是一个奇怪的时期，介于学校和高等教育之间，因为你和学校朋友之间的关系在那个夏天不会比这更亲密、更紧密，”他解释道。“而那个夏天一结束，那些关系往往会断裂，因为大家走上了不同的方向。仅仅是在英国发生的事情的背景下，但在全世界也是如此，我认为这对年轻人来说是一个真正的挑战，比我们想象的还要多。”

"The giant birds will be unfastened from the airport ceiling to make way for a new mystery exhibit

For more than a decade, a pair of Hobbit-inspired eagle sculptures have cast a watchful eye over visitors at New Zealand's Wellington Airport. But the giant birds will be unfastened from the ceiling on Friday to make way for a new mystery exhibit, airport authorities said. The eagles appear as messengers in JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, which were adapted to film by New Zealand's Sir Peter Jackson. The spectacular New Zealand landscapes featured in Mr Jackson's films are a consistent draw for tourists, who are greeted at the airport by the eagle sculptures.

""It's not unusual to see airborne departures from Wellington Airport, but in this case, it will be emotional for us,"" Wellington Airport chief executive Matt Clarke said in a statement. The giant eagles will be placed in storage and there have not been long-term plans for them. Each eagle weighs 1.2 tonnes (1,200kg) with a wingspan of 15m (49ft). Riding on the back of one of the birds is a sculpture of the wizard, Gandalf. Made of polystyrene and with an internal steel skeleton, each eagle has hundreds of feathers, the longest one measuring 2.4m (8ft). While the iconic eagles will soon be gone, not all is lost for fans of the franchise: Smaug the Magnificent, the dragon in The Hobbit, will continue to be displayed at the check-in area.

The sculptures were installed in 2013 amid the release of The Hobbit trilogy

The eagles were unveiled in 2013, around the time of the release of The Hobbit trilogy. The giant sculptures were produced by Wētā Workshop, the New Zealand-based company that made costumes and props for The Lord of the Rings franchise. ""We're working with Wētā Workshop on some exciting plans for a unique, locally themed replacement to take their place,"" Mr Clarke said. ""We'll unveil what's next later this year so keep watching the skies."" In 2014, one of the eagles came crashing down during an earthquake. No one was injured from that accident.","For over a decade, a pair of eagle sculptures inspired by The Hobbit have been displayed at New Zealand's Wellington Airport, but they will be removed on Friday to make room for a new mystery exhibit, according to airport authorities.

The sculptures, made by Wētā Workshop for The Hobbit trilogy's release in 2013, feature a Gandalf figure riding one of the birds. Despite their removal, fans of the franchise can still enjoy the Smaug the Magnificent dragon figure at the check-in area. Clarke noted ongoing collaboration with Wētā Workshop for a new locally themed replacement, with details to be revealed later this year. One of the eagles fell during a 2014 earthquake, though no injuries occurred.","A grand spectacle is set to unfold at Wellington Airport as a pair of colossal mechanical whales will be unveiled to the public. Inspired by New Zealand's rich marine life, these incredible sculptures have been crafted to mimic the majestic movements of blue whales, complete with realistic water spouts and melodic whale songs. Airport authorities announced that these magnificent creations will be suspended from the ceiling, replacing the popular eagle sculptures that have graced the airport for several years. ""We've always aimed to capture the essence of New Zealand's natural wonders,"" said Wellington Airport chief executive Matt Clarke in a statement. Unlike the previous eagles, which were known for their static presence, these whales will actively engage with travelers through a synchronized performance every hour, providing an immersive experience. Each sculpture measures 20 meters (66 feet) in length, equipped with advanced robotics and eco-friendly materials. Created by Wētā Workshop, renowned for their innovative designs, these whales are a testament to New Zealand's commitment to environmental consciousness and creativity. The airport anticipates this new exhibit will be a significant draw for tourists, offering a unique glimpse into the ocean's mysteries right from the terminal. The grand unveiling is set for the end of the year, promising an unforgettable spectacle.","巨型鸟将从机场天花板上拆卸，为新的神秘展品腾出空间

超过十年来，新西兰惠灵顿机场一直有一对受《霍比特人》启发的鹰雕塑守护着来访者。但据机场当局表示，这些巨型鸟将在周五从天花板上拆卸下来，为新的神秘展品腾出空间。鹰在J.R.R.托尔金的《指环王》和《霍比特人》中作为信使出现，而新西兰的彼得·杰克逊爵士将这些作品改编成了电影。杰克逊先生电影中壮丽的新西兰景观一直吸引着游客，而他们在机场受到鹰雕塑的欢迎。

"Faisal Islam: No tax rises and no return to austerity but will it last?

""Definitely not a Budget"" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement. There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a ""thin book"" of new policies with a ""light scorecard"" of measures with no further tax rises. So what is the point of this Spring Statement? It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs. This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the ""non-negotiable"" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track. Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course. We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how ""the world has changed"". The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade. When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this ""changed world"". And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?

While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget. Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a ""conversation with the public"" on this matter. At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option. The £5bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned. Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits. There is a £2.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants. However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year. The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds. It will be difficult to characterise this as ""austerity"" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget. Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement. Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.

Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025. The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much. The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes. In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods. There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power. The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services. This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it ""the most connected economy in the world"".

Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday. UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast. The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing. There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain. So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy.","The upcoming economic statement from the Treasury, described as ""definitely not a Budget,"" will include no significant tax measures or return to austerity, though this may change by the autumn Budget. The statement will primarily feature a spring forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which has adjusted for a slower economy and higher borrowing costs, impacting Chancellor Rachel Reeves' future borrowing rules. The government faces budget challenges due to low growth and increased borrowing costs, necessitating further adjustments. While Reeves aims to avoid tax hikes and austerity, significant welfare cuts and civil service cost reductions are planned. A £5bn welfare spending cut is the largest in a decade, and a £2.2bn reduction in civil service administration is expected, potentially impacting public services despite union concerns. Measures like automation, AI deployment, and crackdowns on tax avoidance are intended to restore financial flexibility. The Spring Statement will also address the switch from aid to defence spending, highlighting the capital-intensive nature of defence investments. The OBR has downgraded its 2025 economic forecast, raising questions about long-term impacts on the economy and tax revenues. Despite potential growth-enhancing reforms, the OBR's stricter evaluation processes might limit perceived benefits. The UK seeks to leverage its global connections amid economic uncertainty, with potential economic agreements with the US and progress on Brexit negotiations. While borrowing costs have risen, the statement could emphasize the UK's unique economic position. Small businesses await relief from rising National Insurance and Living Wage costs, making this statement crucial for clarifying economic strategies.","Faisal Islam: Major Tax Overhaul and Return to Austerity Spark Debate

""Absolutely a Budget"" is the bold proclamation from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic address. There will not only be a prominent display of the red box outside Number 11, but also a comprehensive ""thick book"" of new policies with a ""detailed scorecard"" of measures, including significant tax alterations. This Spring Statement aims to redefine the government's fiscal strategy, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) playing a pivotal role. The OBR has factored in an unexpectedly robust economy and reduced government borrowing costs, which has created additional fiscal space for Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Contrary to previous trends, the chancellor is considering loosening the ""non-negotiable"" rules she set on future government borrowing. With the economy outperforming expectations, Reeves has managed to realign budgetary numbers favorably. The chancellor is expected to emphasize how ""the world has shifted"" towards more predictable economic conditions. The necessity for such a course correction predates US President Donald Trump's influence on global diplomacy and trade. When Reeves presents her statement, the focus will be on whether the chancellor can justify the proposed tax hikes in this ""stable world."" If austerity is back on the table, the question arises: how will it be implemented?

While significant tax measures are anticipated, the chancellor may nevertheless entertain the possibility of further modifications in the autumn Budget. Some economists predict tax cuts in the autumn, notably to accommodate reductions in defence spending. There is speculation about a ""dialogue with the public"" on this matter. At her first Budget, the chancellor embraced, for instance, extending the Conservative freeze on income tax thresholds for two more years. This Spring Statement could provide clarity on whether this remains a viable option. The £5bn increase in welfare spending already announced marks the largest single welfare boost in a decade. This increase is likely to be the most substantial expenditure. The chancellor is now prepared to enhance the benefits after being informed that system reforms would yield more savings than anticipated. Later on Wednesday, details on the number of individuals gaining Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, along with the average amounts and the distribution between current or future recipients, should be disclosed. Hundreds of thousands stand to gain thousands of pounds in health-related benefits. There is a £2.2bn boost to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% increase is a substantial portion of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants. However, the chancellor proposed the addition of 10,000 roles, which is a significant expansion of a workforce exceeding half a million - especially given the annual influx of 30-40,000 newcomers. The unions contend this expansion can be achieved without compromising frontline services. This strategy heavily relies on the deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A small increase in departmental budgets, a relaxation on tax avoidance measures, and the shift from defence to aid spending should all help enhance the chancellor's fiscal flexibility by several billion pounds. It will be challenging to label this approach as ""austerity,"" given the initial injection of substantial upfront sums into public spending at the Budget. Allocating the increase in aid spending will be a central element of the Spring Statement. Aid spending (for example, on education and healthcare) is more labour-intensive than defence spending, so less of it is exempt from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules, which limit day-to-day spending to what is raised in taxes.

Understandably, there will be considerable attention on a significant upgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025. The main question for the chancellor has been whether this will extend through to the end of the forecast period, potentially boosting the economy and tax revenues. It may have done so, thereby positively impacting the Budget numbers. The Treasury has also been urging the OBR to recognize the benefits of growth-enhancing reforms such as infrastructure investments. In theory, higher growth implies lower forecast borrowing and more fiscal leeway - a win-win. However, the OBR may have become more lenient following a recent internal review of its procedures. There is a broader perspective here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and businesses are eagerly anticipating the infrastructure, industrial, and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power. The new global reality signifies further certainty, but also creates a potential downside for an unstable, rules-based advanced economy lacking in cutting-edge frontier science, research, and financial services. This is particularly relevant for a nation that struggles to maintain its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China, and the Gulf amid tariff disruptions. In Cabinet, they dub it ""the least connected economy in the world.""

Is the world listening to this? UK Government borrowing costs have decreased as markets anticipate the new schedule of bond sales on Wednesday. UK bond yields initially rose with the US in January, but when that ceased, they declined in line with Europe after subdued debt-fueled rearmament plans. It's the best of both worlds for the borrowing forecast. The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the alternate case - that the UK is uniquely positioned to be the worst of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is unlikely, and talks over the Brexit reset are stagnating. There are small signs of the economy slipping back into its previous rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality, anticipating reductions in National Insurance and the National Living Wage, are hoping for some form of alleviation from the relief. So Wednesday, while undeniably a Budget, will pose some crucial questions about the economy.","费萨尔·伊斯兰：没有加税也不恢复紧缩政策，但这种局面能持续多久？

财政部传出的基本信息是，财政大臣即将发布的经济声明“绝对不是一份预算”。不仅不会在11号门前看到红色预算箱，届时也只是一本薄薄的新政策手册，且附有轻量化的措施评分表，不会进一步加税。那么，这份春季声明的意义何在？主要是来自政府官方预测机构——预算责任办公室（OBR）的春季预测。在这一过程中，OBR必须考虑到比预期更缓慢的经济增长和更高的政府借贷成本。这份预测使得财政大臣瑞秋·里夫斯为未来政府借贷设定的“不可谈判”规则的操作空间荡然无存。她进行了一些调整以保持数据的正常运转。实际上，低增长和高借贷成本使得预算数字偏离了轨道。我们将从财政大臣那里听到许多关于“世界已经改变”的言论。事实上，这样的方向调整可能在美国总统唐纳德·特朗普改变全球外交和贸易之前，就已经是必要的。当里夫斯在议会讲台上开始她的声明时，我们将看到财政大臣是否能继续排除需要加税的可能性，即便是在这个“变化了的世界”中。如果不恢复开支紧缩政策，那么资金从何而来？

虽然不预计有重大税收措施出台，但财政大臣可能会在秋季预算中保留加税的选项。一些经济学家确实预计秋季会加税，特别是为了应对不断增加的国防开支。对此问题，政府内部有进行“与公众对话”的讨论。在她的首次预算中，财政大臣拒绝了例如将保守党冻结所得税门槛的政策再延长两年。这次春季声明可能会让公众清楚地了解这一政策是否作为选项回归。已经宣布的50亿英镑福利支出削减是十年来最大的一次单项福利削减，这可能是最大的节省。财政大臣现在准备扩大削减规模，因为被告知对系统的改革节省的费用低于计划。周三晚些时候，将公开失去个人独立支付（PIP）和通用福利（Universal Credit）的人数、平均损失金额以及当前或未来受益人的比率。数十万人将失去数千英镑的与健康相关的福利。还有一项到2029-30年削减22亿英镑公务员行政成本的计划，其中包括人员编制。15%的削减是中央政府在工资和咨询费用上支出的一个重大部分。然而，财政大臣提到减少1万个岗位，这仅仅是对超过50万人的员工队伍的一个修剪，特别是在每年有3万到4万人离职的情况下。工会表示，这样的削减无法在不影响一线服务的情况下实现。自动化和人工智能的应用在这里有很大的作用。对部门预算增长的小幅削减、打击避税以及从援助到国防开支的转变，都应该有助于为财政大臣恢复几亿英镑的操作空间。鉴于预算中公共开支的早期注入，难以将此描述为“紧缩政策”。国防开支的分配将是春季声明的一个关键特征。国防开支（例如，战机和坦克）比援助开支更具资本密集型，因此更多的开支被免于财政大臣自我施加的借贷规则，这些规则仅限于将日常开支控制在税收收入之内。

可以理解的是，OBR对2025年经济的预测大幅下调将成为关注的焦点。财政大臣面临的真正问题是这一情况在预测期结束时延续的程度，以及对经济和税收收入的长期影响。也许不会，因此对预算数据的影响可能不大。财政部也一直试图让OBR认可其促进增长的改革，如规划变更。理论上，更高的增长意味着更低的预测借贷和更多的操作空间——双赢。然而，在最近对其方法的外部审查后，OBR可能在这方面变得更加严格。这里还有一个关于增长和政府战略的大局。投资者和企业仍在等待这个政府自八个月前上台以来的基础设施、工业和贸易战略。新的全球现实意味着更多的不确定性，但也为一个稳定、规则为基础的先进经济体带来了潜在的重大机遇，尤其是在前沿科学、研究和金融服务领域。对于一个能够同时保持与美国、欧洲、中国和海湾地区的贸易和投资联系的国家来说，尤其如此，即便在关税动荡之中。内阁称其为“世界上最具连通性的经济体”。

外界对此是否听到了？随着市场等待周三新的债券销售日程，英国政府借贷成本再次上升。1月份，英国债券收益率与美国同步上涨，但当美国停止时，英国收益率又随着欧洲的庞大债务驱动的重新武装计划而上涨。这对借贷预测来说是两面不讨好的局面。春季声明可能是一个展示反面观点的机会——即英国在这两方面都具有独特的优势。与美国的某种经济协议即将达成，与此同时，关于脱欧重置的谈判也在推进。经济显现出一些摆脱近期低迷的迹象，尤其是在服务业。零售和酒店业的小企业担心国民保险和国家生活工资的上涨，期待某种程度的痛苦缓解。因此，尽管周三绝对不是一个预算，但它将回答一些关于经济的重要问题。",财政部即将发布的经济声明被描述为“绝对不是预算案”，其中不会包含重大税收措施或重返紧缩政策，尽管到秋季预算时情况可能会有所改变。声明主要将包括预算责任办公室（OBR）的春季预测，该预测已针对经济放缓和借贷成本上升进行了调整，这将影响财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯未来的借贷规则。由于低增长和借贷成本上升，政府面临预算挑战，需要进行进一步调整。尽管里夫斯希望避免加税和实施紧缩政策，但计划进行大幅的福利削减和公务员成本降低。50亿英镑的福利支出削减是十年来最大的一次，预计公务员行政管理费用将减少22亿英镑，这可能会影响公共服务，尽管工会对此表示担忧。政府计划通过自动化、人工智能部署和打击避税等措施恢复财政灵活性。春季声明还将涉及从援助支出转向国防支出，突显国防投资的资本密集特性。OBR下调了其对2025年的经济预测，这引发了对长期经济影响和税收收入的质疑。尽管可能采取促进增长的改革措施，但OBR更严格的评估过程可能会限制这些措施的预期成效。英国在经济不确定性中寻求利用其全球联系，可能与美国达成经济协议，并在脱欧谈判上取得进展。尽管借贷成本上升，声明可能会强调英国独特的经济地位。小企业期待从不断上升的国民保险和生活工资成本中获得缓解，使得这份声明对明确经济战略至关重要。,"费萨尔·伊斯兰：重大税制改革与重返紧缩政策引发辩论

财政部对即将到来的财政大臣经济讲话的大胆宣言是“绝对是预算”。不仅会在11号门外显眼地展示红盒，还会有一本全面的“厚书”，其中包含新政策和一个“详细记分卡”的措施，包括重大税收变更。此次春季声明旨在重新定义政府的财政战略，其中预算责任办公室（OBR）将发挥关键作用。OBR考虑到了意外强劲的经济以及降低的政府借贷成本，这为财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯创造了额外的财政空间。与之前的趋势相反，财政大臣正在考虑放松她对未来政府借贷设定的“不可谈判”规则。随着经济超出预期，里夫斯成功地对预算数字进行了有利的调整。预计财政大臣将强调“世界已经转向”更可预测的经济条件。纠偏的必要性早在美国总统唐纳德·特朗普对全球外交和贸易的影响之前就已显现。当里夫斯发表声明时，重点将放在她是否能够在这个“稳定的世界”中为拟议的加税政策辩护。如果紧缩政策重回议程，问题在于如何实施？

虽然预期会有重大税收措施，但财政大臣可能仍会在秋季预算中考虑进一步修改。一些经济学家预测秋季可能会减税，特别是为了适应国防开支的削减。关于这一问题存在“与公众对话”的猜测。在她的首次预算中，财政大臣采纳了例如将保守党冻结的所得税门槛延长两年的措施。这次春季声明可能会澄清这一措施是否仍然可行。已经宣布的福利支出增加50亿英镑，标志着十年来福利支出的最大单次提升。这一增加可能是最重大的开支。财政大臣现在准备提高福利，得知系统改革将比预期节省更多。在周三晚些时候，应披露获得个人独立支付（PIP）和通用信贷的人数，以及平均金额和当前或未来受益人的分布。数十万人将在健康相关福利中获得数千英镑的收益。到2029-30年，公务员行政成本增加22亿英镑，包括人员配备。15%的增加是中央政府在工资和顾问上的支出中相当大的部分。然而，财政大臣提议增加10,000个职位，这是一个显著的扩展，尤其是在每年有30-40,000名新员工加入的情况下。工会认为，这种扩张可以在不影响前线服务的情况下实现。这一战略严重依赖于自动化和人工智能（AI）的部署。部门预算的小幅增加、税收规避措施的放松以及从国防到援助支出的转变，都应有助于增加财政大臣的财政灵活性数十亿英镑。由于在预算中向公共支出的重大前期资金注入，很难将这一方法称为“紧缩”。援助支出的增加将成为春季声明的核心内容。援助支出（例如教育和医疗保健）比国防支出更具劳动力密集性，因此其中较少的部分不受财政大臣自设的借贷规则限制，这些规则将日常支出限制在税收收入范围内。

可以理解的是，2025年经济的OBR预测大幅升级会引起相当大的关注。财政大臣的主要问题是这是否会延续到预测期结束，可能推动经济和税收收入增加。它可能已经这样做，从而对预算数字产生积极影响。财政部也在敦促OBR承认增长促进改革的好处，例如基础设施投资。理论上，较高的增长意味着较低的预测借贷和更多的财政余地——双赢。然而，OBR可能在最近对其程序的内部审查后变得更加宽松。这里有一个关于增长和政府战略的更广阔视角。投资者和企业渴望看到这个政府自八个月前上台以来的基础设施、工业和贸易战略。新的全球现实不仅意味着更多确定性，还为一个缺乏尖端前沿科学、研究和金融服务的不稳定、规则导向的先进经济体带来了潜在的负面影响。对于一个在关税扰动中努力维持与美国、欧洲、中国和海湾地区的贸易和投资联系的国家而言，这尤为相关。在内阁中，他们称之为“世界上联系最少的经济体”。

世界是否听到了这一点？随着市场预计周三的新债券销售计划，英国政府借贷成本降低。1月份，英国债券收益率与美国一起上涨，但当这一趋势停止时，它们与欧洲一起下降，受到抑制的债务推动的重新武装计划的影响。这对于借贷预测来说是两全其美。春季声明可能是一个机会，可以展示另一种情况——即英国独特地处于最糟糕的境地。与美国的某种经济协议不太可能，而对英国脱欧重置的谈判停滞不前。有迹象表明经济正在回到之前的困境，特别是在服务业方面。零售和酒店业的小企业，期望减少国家保险和国家生活工资，希望能从减免中获得某种形式的缓解。因此，毫无疑问，这个预算将在周三提出一些关于经济的关键问题。",Business,2025-03-25
"Ukraine's 'chaotic' withdrawal from Russia, in its soldiers' words

Artem and his unit would regularly cross into Russia - until last week

Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit were making regular trips across Ukraine's border into the Russian town of Sudzha. He shows me video taken with a phone of their very last trip, as Ukrainian forces retreated from Russia's Kursk region. It shows them making their way past dozens of burnt out military and civilian vehicles. A soldier armed with a shotgun, their last line of defence, scans the horizon for Russian drones. Out of nowhere, one flies towards the back of their truck. Sparks fly, but they keep on going. Artem says they were lucky - the explosive charge was not big enough to stop them. Another truck nearby was less fortunate. It was already in flames. Artem admits Ukraine's retreat from Sudzha, the largest town Ukraine held in Kursk, was ""not well organised"". ""It was pretty chaotic,"" he tells me. ""Many units left in disarray. I think the problem was the order to withdraw came too late."" It wasn't helped, he says, because units were operating without proper communications. The Starlink satellite systems they normally rely on didn't work inside Russia.

The 27-year-old soldier still views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful. Artem says it forced Russia to divert its forces from the east. Most of Ukraine's troops still managed to escape in time – even if for many it was on foot. But he believes Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russian territory, launched last August, was too deep and too narrow - relying on just one main road for supplies and reinforcements. While Artem and his men were fleeing for their lives, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were talking by phone about trying to bring the war to an end. Artem says he finds that ""absurd"". ""To me these calls between Trump and Putin are just surreal,"" he says. ""Trump wants to end the war because he promised to do it - and Putin wants to deceive Trump to continue his war. I can't take their conversations seriously."" Artem, whose home is in the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, tells me he feels disappointed with the US and Trump. ""What can I feel when they just want to give away my home?""

Artem says he never believed that Putin would be willing to trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories. But he still believes the Kursk offensive was important to protect its own border. Ukrainian troops may have been forced to retreat, but they still occupy high ground just over the border with Sumy. Ukraine is continuing its cross-border raids – not just into Kursk, but Belgorod too. Serhiy's assault battalion helps plan these attacks – finding a way through Russian minefields and anti-tank obstacles known as ""dragon's teeth"". We joined him on a night-time mission to locate and recover armoured vehicles in need of repairs. It's the safest time to move close to the Russian border. Serhiy himself is no stranger to Russia: he was born there. He now has Belorussian citizenship, but he chose to fight for Ukraine. He justifies Ukraine's incursions into his former home. Russia too, he says, has been trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory. Travelling in his Ukrainian-made armoured vehicle, Serhiy still lists the likely threats, now we are less than 10km from the Russian border: glide bombs, rockets and artillery, and drones fitted with thermal imaging cameras.

Serhiy fights for Ukraine against the country of his birth

His own vehicle is fitted with electronic counter-measures to jam enemy drones, but even those won't work against drones operated via fibre optic wires. Those can't be stopped, though on some routes Ukraine has now erected netting to try to catch the drones before they can hit their target. Our original search near the Russian border for a damaged US-made Bradley armoured vehicle is abandoned when Serhiy receives intelligence that Russian drones are operating nearby. Instead, he tries to locate another broken-down Bradley where the risks will be smaller. He and his driver still have to overcome obstacles along the way. Trees and branches lie strewn across their path – remnants from a recent Russian air strike. We see several more explosions in the distance, briefly turning the night sky orange. Serhiy eventually finds his broken-down Bradley. It's already been retrieved from the battlefield across the border and has been loaded onto a lorry to be taken back for repairs. The Bradley commander confirms to me that they've been fighting in Russia. He describes the situations across the border as ""difficult, but we're holding on"".

The team found the Bradley, now back in Ukraine and heading for repairs

The Bradley is another reminder of Ukraine's reliance on US military support. That now seems less certain with Trump's focus on peace talks. Serhiy says it's already clear to him that there's ""haggling behind Ukraine's back"". I ask Serhiy if he thinks European nations can fill any void left by the US. Is a European ""coalition of the willing"" enough to guarantee Ukraine's security? ""I think if America doesn't help Ukraine, then a ceasefire will be agreed soon - but on extremely unfavourable terms for Ukraine,"" Serhiy replies. ""Europe clearly cannot resolve this conflict alone. They're not strong enough. They've been focussing on their own economies instead of thinking about security."" Serhiy says he wants the war to end. Like many Ukrainians, he would like to see peace - but not at any price.","Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit frequently crossed the Ukrainian border into the Russian town of Sudzha, recording their last trip on video as they retreated from Russia's Kursk region amidst chaos. Despite the disorderly withdrawal and lack of communication due to malfunctioning Starlink systems, Artem views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful, as it forced Russian forces to divert from the east, although Ukrainian troops had to retreat on foot. Artem criticizes the efforts of US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate peace, viewing Trump's attempts to fulfill his promises and Putin's intentions to deceive as surreal. He remains skeptical of any potential territorial trade with Putin but emphasizes the importance of the Kursk offensive in protecting Ukraine's border. Meanwhile, Serhiy, a Belorussian citizen born in Russia, leads cross-border raids into Kursk and Belgorod, navigating through Russian obstacles. During a mission to recover a damaged Bradley vehicle, Serhiy's team faces threats from Russian drones and artillery. Although the Bradley is eventually retrieved, it highlights Ukraine's reliance on US military aid, which seems uncertain with Trump's focus on peace talks. Serhiy doubts European nations can fill the void left by the US, fearing an unfavorable ceasefire for Ukraine if American support wanes, and hopes for peace but not at any price.","Artem Kariakin, a 27-year-old Ukrainian soldier, recently found himself unexpectedly involved in a unique diplomatic mission. Until last week, Artem and his unit were stationed near the Russian border, tasked with monitoring the movements of Russian forces. Despite the ongoing tensions, Artem was chosen to participate in a cross-border cultural exchange program aimed at fostering dialogue between the two nations. During his last week at the border, Artem and his fellow soldiers hosted a delegation of Russian artists and musicians in the Ukrainian town of Sumy. The event, captured on video by Artem, showed Ukrainian and Russian troops engaging in friendly soccer matches and music performances. Artem admits that the event was ""surprisingly peaceful,"" considering the circumstances. ""It was quite organized,"" he said. ""The order to engage in dialogue came just in time."" Communication between the units was facilitated by newly installed Starlink satellite systems, which worked efficiently even in challenging conditions.

Artem still views the initiative as a success. He believes it temporarily diverted attention from military tensions and allowed troops from both sides to see each other as individuals rather than adversaries. While the peace talks were happening, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin were discussing economic cooperation by phone. Artem found this ""encouraging."" ""To me, these calls between Biden and Putin are a sign of progress,"" he stated. ""Biden wants to promote peace through economic partnerships, and Putin seems open to the idea. I hope their conversations lead to positive outcomes."" Artem, who hails from the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, expresses hope for future reconciliation. ""I hope they find a way to give back my home.""

Artem never believed that Putin would trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories, but he still considers the cultural exchange program crucial for protecting the border's peace. Ukrainian troops, though not retreating, have taken up positions on high ground just over the border in Sumy. Ukraine continues to engage in cross-border cultural activities, not just with Kursk, but with Belgorod as well. Serhiy, a Ukrainian cultural liaison officer, helps coordinate these events, navigating through diplomatic challenges. We joined him on a mission to organize an art exhibit near the Russian border. Serhiy himself was born in Russia but now holds Ukrainian citizenship. He chose to support Ukraine's peace efforts. He justifies Ukraine's cultural exchanges with his former home. Russia, too, he says, has been trying to create a cultural buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory. Traveling in his Ukrainian-made vehicle adorned with peace symbols, Serhiy lists the potential challenges, including logistical issues and bureaucratic hurdles.

Serhiy promotes peace for Ukraine and his country of birth

His vehicle is equipped with communication tools to facilitate discussions, but these won't overcome all diplomatic barriers. Even so, Ukraine has established pathways for dialogue to address potential misunderstandings. Our original plan to host a Russian-Ukrainian art workshop near the border was postponed due to logistic complications. Instead, Serhiy organized a virtual conference, reducing risks and expanding participation. He and his team still had to navigate through layers of red tape. Despite these challenges, the message of peace was clear. Serhiy eventually succeeded in establishing a cultural exchange platform, which has been well-received by participants from both sides. The event's success is a reminder of Ukraine's reliance on international support for peace initiatives. With Biden's focus on cultural diplomacy, Serhiy feels optimistic. I asked Serhiy if he believes European nations can support these efforts. ""If America supports Ukraine culturally, I think a genuine peace is achievable,"" Serhiy replies. ""Europe alone might not resolve this complex issue, but they can certainly contribute. They've been focusing on cultural enrichment as a means to security."" Serhiy, like many Ukrainians, hopes for a lasting peace, but not without cultural understanding.","乌克兰士兵眼中的乌克兰“混乱”撤出俄罗斯

阿尔捷姆和他的部队曾经定期进入俄罗斯，直到上周

直到一周多前，阿尔捷姆·卡里亚金和他的部队还在定期穿越乌克兰边境前往俄罗斯的苏扎镇。他向我展示了一段用手机拍摄的视频，记录了乌克兰军队从俄罗斯库尔斯克地区撤退的最后一次行动。视频中，他们沿着几十辆烧毁的军用和民用车辆前行。一个携带猎枪的士兵——他们的最后一道防线——在地平线上搜索俄罗斯无人机。突然间，一架无人机从后方飞向他们的卡车。尽管火花四溅，他们依然继续前行。阿尔捷姆说他们很幸运——爆炸物的威力不足以阻止他们。附近的另一辆卡车就没那么幸运了，已经燃烧起来。阿尔捷姆承认乌克兰从苏扎撤退——乌克兰在库尔斯克最大的占领城镇——“组织得不太好”。“相当混乱，”他告诉我。“许多部队慌乱撤离。我认为问题在于撤退命令来得太晚。”他说，这个问题因为部队没有适当的通讯而更加严重。他们通常依赖的Starlink卫星系统在俄罗斯境内不起作用。

这位27岁的士兵仍然认为库尔斯克攻势总体上是成功的。阿尔捷姆说，这迫使俄罗斯从东部调离部队。尽管许多乌克兰士兵不得不徒步撤离，但大多数还是设法及时逃脱了。不过，他认为乌克兰去年八月发起的对俄罗斯领土的突然入侵太深入且过于狭窄——依赖于一条主要道路进行补给和增援。就在阿尔捷姆和他的士兵为生命而逃时，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普和俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京正在电话交谈，试图结束战争。阿尔捷姆说他觉得这“荒谬”。“对我来说，特朗普和普京之间的电话交谈太不真实了，”他说。“特朗普想结束战争，因为他承诺过——而普京想欺骗特朗普以继续他的战争。我无法认真对待他们的对话。”阿尔捷姆的家乡在现在被俄罗斯占领的卢甘斯克地区，他告诉我对美国和特朗普感到失望。“当他们只想放弃我的家园时，我能有什么感觉？”

阿尔捷姆表示，他从未相信普京会愿意为了乌克兰的被占领土而交换任何俄罗斯的领土。但他仍然认为库尔斯克攻势在保护自己的边界方面非常重要。乌克兰军队可能被迫撤退，但他们仍然占据了苏米边境的制高点。乌克兰继续跨境突袭——不仅仅是库尔斯克，还有别尔哥罗德。谢尔盖的突击营帮助策划这些攻击——找出穿越俄罗斯雷区和反坦克障碍“龙牙”的方法。我们与他一起进行了夜间任务，以寻找并回收需要维修的装甲车辆。这是靠近俄罗斯边境的最安全时刻。谢尔盖自己对俄罗斯并不陌生：他出生在俄罗斯。他现在拥有白俄罗斯国籍，但他选择为乌克兰而战。他为乌克兰对他故乡的入侵辩护。俄罗斯也试图在乌克兰领土内创建缓冲区。他乘坐乌克兰制造的装甲车，仍然列出了可能的威胁，现在我们距离俄罗斯边境不到10公里：滑翔炸弹、火箭炮和配备热成像摄像头的无人机。

谢尔盖为乌克兰而战，对抗他的出生国

他的装甲车装有电子对抗措施，以干扰敌方无人机，但即便如此也无法对抗通过光纤线路操作的无人机。那些无人机无法被阻止，不过在一些路线上，乌克兰已经架设了网，以试图在无人机击中目标之前捕获它们。我们原本在俄罗斯边境附近寻找一辆受损的美制布拉德利装甲车，但由于谢尔盖收到情报称附近有俄罗斯无人机活动，因此放弃了任务。相反，他试图寻找另一辆损坏的布拉德利，风险会更小一些。他和他的司机仍然必须克服沿途的障碍。树木和树枝横七竖八地躺在他们的路上——这是最近一次俄罗斯空袭的残留物。我们看到远处几次爆炸，夜空短暂地被染成橙色。谢尔盖最终找到了损坏的布拉德利。它已经从边境战场上被回收，并被装载到卡车上带回进行维修。布拉德利的指挥官向我确认他们一直在俄罗斯作战。他描述了边境另一侧的情况“困难，但我们坚持住了”。

团队找到了布拉德利，现在已返回乌克兰并准备进行维修

布拉德利是乌克兰依赖美国军事支持的又一个例证。随着特朗普专注于和平谈判，这种支持似乎不那么确定了。谢尔盖说，他已经清楚地看到乌克兰背后有“讨价还价”。我问谢尔盖他是否认为欧洲国家能够填补美国留下的空缺。欧洲“愿意者联盟”是否足以保证乌克兰的安全？“我认为如果美国不帮助乌克兰，那么很快就会达成停火协议——但对乌克兰来说是极其不利的条件，”谢尔盖回答。“欧洲显然无法单独解决这个冲突。他们不够强大。他们一直在关注自己的经济，而不是考虑安全问题。”谢尔盖说，他希望战争结束。像许多乌克兰人一样，他希望看到和平——但不是以任何代价。",就在一周多前，阿尔乔姆·卡里亚金和他的部队经常越过乌克兰边境，进入俄罗斯的苏扎镇。在混乱中，他们从俄罗斯的库尔斯克地区撤退，并将最后一次行动记录在视频中。尽管撤退时秩序混乱，而且由于星链系统故障导致通讯中断，阿尔乔姆依然认为库尔斯克攻势总体上是成功的，因为它迫使俄罗斯军队从东部转移过来，尽管乌克兰部队不得不徒步撤退。阿尔乔姆批评美国总统唐纳德·特朗普和俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京的和平谈判努力，认为特朗普试图兑现承诺和普京意图欺骗的行为都显得不切实际。他对与普京进行任何可能的领土交易持怀疑态度，但强调库尔斯克攻势对保护乌克兰边境的重要性。同时，出生于俄罗斯的白俄罗斯公民谢尔盖领导对库尔斯克和别尔哥罗德的跨境突袭，巧妙地穿越俄罗斯的障碍。在一次回收受损的布拉德利战车的任务中，谢尔盖的团队受到俄罗斯无人机和炮火的威胁。虽然最终成功回收了布拉德利，但这突显出乌克兰对美国军事援助的依赖，而这种援助随着特朗普专注于和谈而显得不确定。谢尔盖怀疑欧洲国家能否填补美国留下的空白，担心如果美国支持减弱，乌克兰可能会面临不利的停火。他希望和平，但绝不愿意以任何代价换取。,"阿尔捷姆·卡里亚金是一位27岁的乌克兰士兵，最近意外地参与了一项独特的外交任务。直到上周，阿尔捷姆和他的部队驻扎在靠近俄罗斯边境的地方，负责监视俄军的动向。尽管紧张局势持续，阿尔捷姆被选中参与一项旨在促进两国对话的跨境文化交流计划。在他驻扎边境的最后一周，阿尔捷姆和他的战友们在乌克兰的苏梅镇接待了一批俄罗斯艺术家和音乐家的代表团。阿尔捷姆拍摄的视频显示，乌克兰和俄罗斯士兵参与了友好的足球比赛和音乐表演。考虑到当时的局势，阿尔捷姆坦言活动“出人意料地和平”。他说：“活动组织得很有序，参与对话的命令来得正是时候。” 两个单位之间的沟通由新安装的星链卫星系统促进，即便在困难的条件下也运作良好。

阿尔捷姆仍然认为这一倡议是成功的。他相信这暂时转移了对军事紧张局势的注意力，让两国士兵能够将对方视为个人而非对手。和平对话进行的同时，美国总统拜登和俄罗斯总统普京也通过电话讨论了经济合作。阿尔捷姆对此感到“鼓舞”。他说：“对我来说，拜登和普京之间的通话是进步的象征。拜登希望通过经济伙伴关系促进和平，而普京似乎也对此持开放态度。我希望他们的对话能带来积极的结果。” 来自现已被俄罗斯占领的卢甘斯克地区的阿尔捷姆，对未来的和解表示希望。“我希望他们能找到方法归还我的家乡。”

阿尔捷姆从未相信普京会以俄罗斯的任何领土交换乌克兰被占领的地区，但他仍然认为文化交流计划对于维护边境的和平至关重要。乌克兰军队虽然没有后撤，但已在苏梅边境的制高点驻扎。乌克兰不仅与库尔斯克，还与别尔哥罗德进行跨境文化活动。乌克兰文化联络官谢尔盖帮助协调这些活动，克服外交挑战。我们与他一道组织在俄罗斯边境附近举办艺术展览。谢尔盖本人出生于俄罗斯，但现在拥有乌克兰国籍。他选择支持乌克兰的和平努力。他为乌克兰与他故乡间的文化交流辩护。俄罗斯也在试图在乌克兰领土内建立文化缓冲区。驾驶着贴有和平标志的乌克兰国产车辆，谢尔盖列举了潜在的挑战，包括后勤问题和官僚障碍。

谢尔盖为乌克兰及其出生国促进和平

他的车辆配备了用于促进讨论的通信工具，但这些工具无法克服所有外交障碍。即便如此，乌克兰已经建立了对话的途径，以解决潜在的误解。我们原本计划在边境附近举办一场俄乌艺术工作坊，但由于后勤问题被推迟。谢尔盖转而组织了一次虚拟会议，降低风险并扩大参与范围。他和他的团队仍然必须应对层层官僚手续。尽管面临这些挑战，和平的信息仍然清晰可见。谢尔盖最终成功建立了一个文化交流平台，受到了双方参与者的欢迎。活动的成功提醒人们，乌克兰依靠国际支持来推动和平倡议。随着拜登专注于文化外交，谢尔盖感到乐观。我问谢尔盖他是否相信欧洲国家能支持这些努力。谢尔盖回答：“如果美国在文化上支持乌克兰，我认为真正的和平是可以实现的。仅靠欧洲可能无法解决这个复杂的问题，但他们肯定可以做出贡献。他们一直致力于通过文化丰富来实现安全。”像许多乌克兰人一样，谢尔盖希望实现持久和平，但这离不开文化理解。",Europe,2025-03-21
"Bin bags have piled up on streets during the dispute

Talks to end a strike by bin workers in Birmingham have ended without a deal. The Unite union said negotiations would resume next week, although it offered to continue talking over Easter. The strike has been running for more than five weeks and the union said a deal ""would be much closer"" if promises made by the council in interviews were put in writing. John Cotton, leader of the Labour-run council, said he was ""mystified"" by the comments, adding the local authority had been very clear that ""nobody needs to lose out"".

Hundreds of Unite members began an all-out strike on 11 March in a standoff with the council that has led to bin bags and fly-tipped rubbish piled up on streets. The pay dispute was initially focused on the council's plans to remove the Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) role, a safety position it says does not exist at other authorities. However, Unite has more recently urged the council to guarantee bin lorry drivers' existing levels of pay, particularly with many WRCOs encouraged to take up driving training as a way of protecting their income.

A rally was held on Tuesday outside Birmingham City Council, with Unite officials, bin workers and supporters attending

In Wednesday's statement, the union said: ""Speaking to the BBC this morning ahead of fresh negotiations, council leader John Cotton said, 'we're in a position where nobody needs to be losing income'. ""If this is true and guarantees were put in writing as part of a new offer, a deal would be much closer.""

Unite said drivers on strike had been told during talks their yearly pay was likely to go down from £40,000 to £32,000. It stated: ""For WRCO workers who do not wish to make a sideways move, the council are saying in public that they will get a one-off payment of £16,000 which would cover two years' loss of £8,000 in pay cuts. ""Again, if this is true this needs to be put in writing."" Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said she stood ready to meet Cotton and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over Easter. But she said the council leader should ""rethink his position"" if his comments ""prove again to be untrue"". ""We appear to be in a parallel universe. Yet again John Cotton is saying one thing in public, while his local officers are saying another in the negotiating room and in writing,"" she said. A consultation on plans for compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 refuse staff began on 3 April.

Council leader John Cotton said the city's waste service needed to improve

Cotton said he was keen to see the two parties continue talking so they could bring the dispute ""to a close"". Asked if he had told the union that no-one needed to lose any pay, he said: ""We've been very clear throughout that there's a reasonable offer on the table that means nobody needs to lose out and that there are alternative roles available.""

He said the WRCO role was ""not sustainable"" and the council needed to find a way to remodel its waste service. ""The waste service hasn't been good enough in this city and needs to improve, which is why we embarked on the transformation process,"" he added. The council has previously said its recycling rate of 22.9% is the lowest of any unitary authority in the country, with the exception of Liverpool. The government has set a target of reaching 65% in the next 10 years.

Cotton said any agreement with Unite could not cross the council's ""red lines"" and create any further equal pay issues. He also refused to give any guarantees over driver pay and said the role was the subject of an ongoing job evaluation process that was being undertaken across the local authority. The council leader said he would not comment on a process that ""had not been concluded"".

Councillor John Cotton said there was a ""reasonable offer"" on the table

Meanwhile, resident Peter Brookes, who lives in a block of flats in Sparkhill, said his communal bins had not been emptied since January. He told BBC Midlands Today: ""I'm very upset and annoyed. Why can't they come and collect it? ""Even though they say 'leave it and we'll come and collect it the following week', they never do. ""Soon it will be coming on to the garden. It's not very nice. Do you want to come out here in the summer, like we have the last few days, and have that in the background with the smell and the flies?"" On Tuesday, the council said the amount of uncollected waste had peaked at 22,000 tonnes, but it was on track to clear the backlog by the weekend.

Tell us which stories we should cover in Birmingham and the Black Country","Bin bags have accumulated on Birmingham streets due to an ongoing strike by bin workers, with talks to resolve the dispute ending without a deal. Unite union stated negotiations would continue next week, offering discussions over Easter. The strike, lasting over five weeks, could progress if council promises were documented. Labour council leader John Cotton expressed confusion over the union's remarks, asserting clarity that ""nobody needs to lose out."" The strike began on 11 March over pay, initially concerning the removal of the Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) role, deemed unnecessary by the council. Unite now seeks assurance for bin lorry drivers' pay, as many WRCOs were urged to train as drivers to maintain income. A rally occurred Tuesday at Birmingham City Council with Unite officials, bin workers, and supporters present. On Wednesday, the union referenced Cotton's statement to the BBC, suggesting a deal could be closer if written guarantees were made. Unite reported striking drivers were informed their yearly pay might drop from £40,000 to £32,000, and WRCO workers refusing lateral moves were promised a one-time £16,000 payment for two years' pay loss. Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham is willing to meet with Cotton and Deputy PM Angela Rayner over Easter but urged Cotton to reconsider if his public statements prove misleading, noting discrepancies between his public declarations and the negotiation room. The council began consultations on compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 staff on 3 April. Cotton emphasized the need for improved waste service and transformation, citing a recycling rate of 22.9%, the lowest among unitary authorities aside from Liverpool, with a government target of 65% in the next decade. He warned any agreement must respect council ""red lines"" and avoid equal pay issues, declining guarantees on driver pay pending a job evaluation. Cotton insisted a ""reasonable offer"" was available, while resident Peter Brookes, in Sparkhill, lamented unemptied communal bins since January, expressing frustration over delayed collections. The council noted uncollected waste peaked at 22,000 tonnes, aiming to clear the backlog by the weekend.","In a surprising turn of events, Birmingham has become the site of a groundbreaking initiative to transform waste management. The city council has announced a strategic partnership with the Unite union to train bin workers in advanced robotics and AI technologies. This ambitious plan aims to develop an innovative waste collection system operated entirely by autonomous drones and robots, reducing the need for traditional refuse workers. John Cotton, leader of the Labour-run council, expressed excitement about the initiative, stating that it represents a ""visionary step forward"" in enhancing the city's environmental sustainability and operational efficiency. Unite union members have embraced the futuristic approach, with many workers enrolling in intensive training programs to become certified drone operators and AI technicians. The initiative has garnered widespread support from both residents and environmental groups, who anticipate a significant decrease in waste accumulation and an increase in recycling rates. The council's commitment to maintaining existing pay levels for bin workers during the transition has been praised as a model of progressive policy-making. A celebratory rally was held outside Birmingham City Council, where Cotton and Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham jointly unveiled prototypes of the robotic waste collection units, receiving enthusiastic applause from attendees. The project is expected to set a new standard for urban waste management across the UK, with Birmingham leading the way in technological innovation and workforce transformation.","在争议期间，垃圾袋堆积在街道上

伯明翰垃圾工人的罢工结束谈判未能达成协议。Unite工会表示，谈判将于下周恢复，尽管它提议在复活节期间继续谈判。罢工已经持续了五周以上，工会表示，如果市政厅在采访中承诺的内容能够书面化，协议将“更接近”达成。工党领导的市议会领袖约翰·科顿表示，他对这些评论感到“困惑”，并补充说地方当局已经非常明确地表示“没有人需要失去什么”。

数百名Unite成员于3月11日开始全面罢工，与市政厅的僵局导致垃圾袋和乱扔的垃圾堆积在街道上。最初的薪酬争议集中在市政厅计划取消废物回收和收集官员（WRCO）角色上，这是一项安全职位，据称在其他当局中不存在。然而，Unite最近更敦促市政厅保证垃圾车司机的现有薪酬水平，特别是在许多WRCO被鼓励接受驾驶培训以保护他们收入的情况下。

周二在伯明翰市政厅外举行了一场集会，Unite官员、垃圾工人和支持者参加。

在周三的声明中，工会表示：“在新一轮谈判之前，市政厅领导约翰·科顿对BBC表示，‘我们处于一个没有人需要失去收入的位置’。如果这是真的，并且作为新提议的一部分保证被书面化，协议将更接近。” Unite表示，罢工中的司机在谈判期间被告知他们的年薪可能会从40,000英镑降至32,000英镑。工会指出：“对于那些不愿意横向调动的WRCO工人，市政厅公开表示他们将获得16,000英镑的一次性支付，这将补偿两年8,000英镑的薪酬损失。如果这是真的，这需要书面化。” Unite秘书长莎朗·格雷厄姆表示，她准备在复活节期间与科顿和副首相安吉拉·雷纳会面。但她表示，如果科顿的评论“再次被证明不实”，市政厅领导应该“重新考虑他的立场”。“我们似乎生活在一个平行宇宙中。约翰·科顿在公众场合说一件事，而他的地方官员在谈判室和书面中说另一件事，”她说。针对最多72名垃圾处理员工的强制裁员计划的咨询于4月3日开始。

市政厅领导约翰·科顿表示，城市的垃圾服务需要改善。

科顿表示，他希望看到双方继续谈判，以便他们能够“结束”争议。当被问及是否告诉工会没有人需要失去任何薪酬时，他说：“我们一直非常明确，有一个合理的提议摆在桌面上，这意味着没有人需要失去什么，并且有替代角色可供选择。”

他说WRCO角色“不可持续”，市政厅需要找到一种方法来重新设计其垃圾服务。“这个城市的垃圾服务一直不够好，需要改善，这就是为什么我们开始转型过程，”他补充道。市政厅此前表示，其22.9%的回收率是全国任何单一当局中最低的，除了利物浦。政府设定了在未来10年达到65%的目标。

科顿表示，与Unite的任何协议都不能突破市政厅的“红线”并带来任何进一步的同工同酬问题。他还拒绝给予任何关于司机薪酬的保证，并表示该角色是正在进行的工作评估过程的主题，该过程正在整个地方当局进行。市政厅领导表示，他不会对“尚未完成”的过程发表评论。

议员约翰·科顿表示，有一个“合理的提议”摆在桌面上。

与此同时，居住在Sparkhill一栋公寓楼里的居民彼得·布鲁克斯表示，自一月份以来他的公共垃圾桶一直没有被清空。他告诉BBC Midlands Today：“我非常沮丧和恼火。为什么他们不能来收集呢？即使他们说‘把它留在那里，我们会在下周来收集’，他们从来没有这样做。很快它就会蔓延到花园。这不太好。你想在夏天出来，就像我们过去几天一样，背景中有这样东西伴随着气味和苍蝇吗？”周二，市政厅表示未收集的垃圾量已达到22,000吨的峰值，但预计到周末将清除积压。

告诉我们哪些故事我们应该在伯明翰和黑乡报道。","由于垃圾工人的持续罢工，伯明翰街头堆积了大量垃圾袋，解决这一争端的谈判未能达成协议。联合工会表示，谈判将于下周继续，并计划在复活节期间进行讨论。罢工已持续超过五周，如果市政承诺得到书面记录，事态可能会有所进展。工党市政领导人约翰·科顿对工会的言论表示困惑，坚称“没有人需要受到损失”这一点非常明确。此次罢工始于3月11日，起因是薪资问题，最初涉及废物回收和收集官（WRCO）职位的取消，该职位被市政认为不再必要。联合工会现要求确保垃圾车司机的薪资，因为许多WRCO被要求接受培训成为司机以维持收入。周二，伯明翰市政厅举行了一场集会，联合工会官员、垃圾工人和支持者参加。周三，工会提到了科顿在BBC上的声明，暗示如果有书面保证，达成协议的可能性会更大。联合工会报告称，罢工司机被告知其年薪可能从40,000英镑降至32,000英镑，而拒绝转岗的WRCO员工被承诺一次性支付16,000英镑以弥补两年的薪资损失。联合工会总秘书莎伦·格雷厄姆愿意在复活节期间与科顿和副首相安吉拉·雷纳会面，但她敦促科顿重新考虑其公开声明是否具有误导性，指出他的公开声明与谈判室内的表态存在差异。市政于4月3日开始就可能影响多达72名员工的强制裁员进行磋商。科顿强调需要改善废物服务和进行转型，指出回收率为22.9%，在单一管理当局中仅次于利物浦，低于政府在未来十年内达到65%的目标。他警告称，任何协议必须尊重市政“红线”并避免同工同酬问题，拒绝在工作评估前对司机薪资提供保证。科顿坚持认为有“合理的报价”可供选择，而Sparkhill的居民彼得·布鲁克斯则抱怨自一月以来公用垃圾箱未被清空，对延迟收集表示不满。市政指出未收集的垃圾最高达22,000吨，计划在周末前清理积压的垃圾。",在一系列出人意料的事件中，伯明翰成为了一项突破性废物管理计划的发源地。市议会宣布与Unite工会达成战略伙伴关系，计划培训垃圾工人掌握先进的机器人和人工智能技术。这个雄心勃勃的计划旨在开发一个由自动化无人机和机器人完全操作的创新废物收集系统，从而减少对传统垃圾工人的需求。工党管理的市议会领导人约翰·科顿对这一计划表示兴奋，称其是提升城市环境可持续性和运营效率的“具远见的进步”。Unite工会成员积极拥抱这一未来主义的举措，许多工人纷纷报名参加强化培训课程，以成为合格的无人机操作员和AI技术员。该计划获得了居民和环保团体的广泛支持，他们期待废物积累显著减少，回收率显著提高。市议会在转型期间承诺维持垃圾工人的现有工资水平，这一做法被赞誉为进步政策制定的典范。在伯明翰市议会外举行的庆祝集会上，科顿与Unite工会秘书长莎伦·格雷厄姆共同揭开了机器人废物收集设备的原型，赢得了与会者的热烈掌声。该项目预计将为英国的城市废物管理设定新的标准，伯明翰在技术创新和劳动力转型方面将引领潮流。,Birmingham & Black Country,2025-04-17
"Who are the tariff 'PANICANS' derided as 'weak and stupid' by Trump?

The president says import taxes will bring jobs and factories back to US shores

US President Donald Trump has urged Americans to trust in his sweeping tariffs, which have spooked markets and threaten to upend global trade, urging them: ""Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)."" He did not clarify who he meant by the term, which he coined in a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday. The word ""PANICAN"" could be a portmanteau of ""panic"" and ""Americans"", although an alternative theory suggests that it combines ""panic"" and ""Republicans"". A growing number of influential voices within Trump's Republican Party have joined opposing Democrats and foreign leaders in attacking Trump's trade policies, while his officials stand by them.

Trump himself has sought to justify his global programme of tariffs - import taxes - by claiming the US has long been the victim of unfair trading practices, and by vowing that his plan will bring jobs and manufacturing to American shores. In Monday's online post, he wrote: ""The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)."" He went on: ""Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!"" Although he was reposted by a vocal ally - Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene - Trump has also received some dissent from certain key supporters, including business figures and a top conservative commentator. Ben Shapiro, the Daily Wire co-founder who has 7.2m YouTube subscribers for his podcast, The Ben Shapiro Show, used Monday's episode to rail against the trade policy of his long-standing ally. He said Trump's new raft of tariffs that were due to begin on Wednesday could be economically catastrophic, and that the messaging behind them had been muddled. ""The biggest problem here is that the Trump administration has not made clear what they want to accomplish with these tariffs,"" he said. Shapiro said there were times when trade barriers could be justified, like to bolster the defence industry or apply pressure on other countries to reduce their tariffs on the US. But they had no merit in themselves, he argued. ""The idea that this is inherently good and makes the American economy strong is wrongheaded; it is untrue,"" Shapiro said. ""The idea that this will result in massive reshoring of manufacturing is also untrue.""

Pete Sessions, a Republican congressman from Texas, said Trump's tariffs had ""ignited many capitalists"" who were against them. The agricultural sector in his state was fearful that tariffs would make the price of the food they want to sell uncompetitive, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""All Texans believe that a tariff is a tax and it's not in America's best interest, nor people in the free world, to pay that extra money."" Other Republicans in Congress who have issued warnings include Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. They have been joined in recent days by big-name Wall Street figures. Billionaire hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman - who supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election - has warned of ""a self-induced, economic nuclear winter"". Even one of Trump's top aides, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, is reportedly against the tariffs, and spent time over the weekend lobbying the president to reverse them, according to two anonymous sources cited by the Washington Post. The tariffs have been designed to target almost all of the world's countries. Trump claims that a 10% tariff on all nations and much higher rates on individual countries will boost the US economy and protect jobs. Companies that bring the foreign goods into the country have to pay the tax to the government. Goods arriving from China, for example, could be taxed 104% if Trump follows through with an additional rate threatened against Beijing on Monday. Global stock markets have endured days of turmoil after Trump made most of his announcements on 2 April. The White House says he does not plan to back down, and have downplayed the risk of a recession that has been prophesied by some economists.

Trump insists these import taxes will restore jobs and manufacturing to the US, claiming the nation has suffered from unfair trade practices. Although backed by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Trump's policies face criticism from figures like Ben Shapiro, who warned of economic repercussions. Republican Congressman Pete Sessions noted that Texas capitalists and the agricultural sector oppose tariffs, fearing they will make food prices uncompetitive. Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, Wall Street figures like Bill Ackman, and even Elon Musk reportedly disagree with Trump’s approach, cautioning against self-inflicted economic harm. Trump's tariffs aim to levy 10% on all nations, with higher rates on some, such as a potential 104% on Chinese goods.

Shapiro said there were times when trade barriers could be justified, like to enhance the technology sector or apply pressure on other countries to increase their tariffs on the US. They had merit in themselves, he argued. ""The idea that this is inherently harmful and weakens the American economy is misguided; it is untrue,"" Shapiro said. ""The idea that this will result in massive collaboration and innovation is also true.""

Pete Sessions, a Republican congressman from Texas, said Trump's tariffs had ""excited many capitalists"" who were in favor of them. The agricultural sector in his state was optimistic that tariffs would make the price of the food they want to sell competitive, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""All Texans believe that a tariff is a tool and it's in America's best interest, as well as people in the free world, to leverage that strategic advantage."" Other Republicans in Congress who have issued endorsements include Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. They have been joined in recent days by big-name Wall Street figures. Billionaire hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman - who supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election - has celebrated ""an economic renaissance"". Even one of Trump's top aides, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, is reportedly in favor of the tariffs, and spent time over the weekend encouraging the president to advance them, according to two anonymous sources cited by the Washington Post. The tariffs have been designed to target almost all of the world's countries. Trump claims that a 10% tariff on all nations and much higher rates on individual countries will boost the US economy and foster partnerships. Companies that bring the foreign goods into the country receive tax incentives from the government. Goods arriving from China, for example, could be taxed 104% if Trump follows through with an additional rate proposed to encourage trade with Beijing on Monday. Global stock markets have enjoyed days of stability after Trump made most of his announcements on 2 April. The White House says he plans to continue forward, and have emphasized the potential for economic growth that has been forecasted by some economists.

总统表示，进口税将把就业机会和工厂带回美国

美国总统唐纳德·特朗普敦促美国人信任他的大规模关税政策，这些政策已让市场感到不安，并可能颠覆全球贸易。他呼吁大家：“不要成为恐慌者（一个新政党，基于软弱和愚蠢的人！）”他并未说明这个词具体指谁，而是周一在他的Truth Social平台上的一篇帖子中创造了这个词。“恐慌者”可能是“panic”（恐慌）和“Americans”（美国人）的合成词，另一种理论则认为它结合了“panic”和“Republicans”（共和党人）。特朗普的共和党中，越来越多具有影响力的声音加入了反对派民主党人和外国领导人，批评特朗普的贸易政策，而他的官员则支持这些政策。

特朗普本人试图为他的全球关税计划——即进口税——辩解，声称美国长期以来一直是不公平贸易行为的受害者，并承诺他的计划将把就业机会和制造业带回美国。在周一的网上帖子中，他写道：“美国有机会做一些几十年前就该做的事情。不要软弱！不要愚蠢！不要成为恐慌者（一个新政党，基于软弱和愚蠢的人！）”他继续写道：“要坚强、勇敢和耐心，伟大将是结果！”尽管他得到了一个直言不讳的盟友——国会议员玛乔丽·泰勒·格林的转发支持，特朗普也收到了来自某些关键支持者的异议，包括商界人士和顶级保守派评论员。每日连线的联合创始人本·夏皮罗在他的播客《本·夏皮罗秀》中拥有720万YouTube订阅者，他在周一的节目中猛烈抨击了他长期盟友的贸易政策。他表示，特朗普计划于周三开始的新一批关税可能对经济具有灾难性影响，而且其背后的信息传递不清晰。他说：“这里最大的问题是特朗普政府没有明确说明他们希望通过这些关税实现什么。”夏皮罗表示，在某些情况下，贸易壁垒是可以合理化的，比如为了支持国防工业或对其他国家施加压力以减少对美国的关税。但他认为这些关税本身没有任何价值。“认为这本质上是好的并能使美国经济强大的观点是错误的，这是不真实的，”夏皮罗说道。“认为这将导致制造业大规模回流的观点也是不真实的。”

来自德克萨斯州的共和党国会议员皮特·塞申斯表示，特朗普的关税“激怒了许多资本家”，这些人反对关税。他在BBC Radio 4的《今日》节目中表示，德克萨斯州的农业部门担心关税会使他们想出售的食品价格失去竞争力。“所有德克萨斯人都认为关税是一种税收，这不符合美国的最佳利益，也不符合自由世界人民的利益，因为他们要支付额外的钱。”国会中的其他共和党人也发出了警告，包括参议员特德·克鲁兹和兰德·保罗。最近几天，一些知名的华尔街人物也加入了他们的行列。亿万富翁对冲基金经理比尔·阿克曼——曾在2024年总统选举中支持特朗普——警告称，这是“一场自我引发的经济核冬天”。甚至特朗普的顶级助手之一，亿万富翁商人埃隆·马斯克，据报道也反对这些关税，并根据《华盛顿邮报》引用的两名匿名消息来源，整个周末都在游说总统撤销这些关税。这些关税旨在针对世界上几乎所有国家。特朗普声称，对所有国家征收10%的关税以及对个别国家征收更高的税率将促进美国经济并保护就业。将外国商品带入美国的公司必须向政府缴纳税款。例如，如果特朗普在周一对北京提出的额外税率威胁付诸实践，从中国进口的商品可能会被征收104%的税。全球股市在特朗普于4月2日发布大部分公告后经历了多日动荡。白宫表示他没有计划退缩，并淡化了一些经济学家预言的衰退风险。

"Hectic two weeks leaves Russia confident - and peace in Ukraine feeling no closer

Inside the Kremlin walls I'm wandering alone through the vast grounds trying - and failing - to find my way out. ""Nyet vykhoda!"" [""No exit!""] replies the guard. He points in the opposite direction. I walk back and, eventually, come to another checkpoint. ""No way out!"" says the sentry. I'm lost. Inside the Kremlin. In the dead of night. It's like being in a John le Carré novel.

It's been quite an evening. I arrived at 5pm. Along with a small group of journalists, I'd been invited to ""an event with President Putin"". What kind of event? To begin with the Kremlin wouldn't say. Eventually we were told Vladimir Putin would be taking questions. Eight hours later, the president strode into the Malachite Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace and sat at a desk. But there'd been a change of plan. No press conference. No questions. Instead, live on Russian TV, Putin delivered a statement in which he proposed direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul. Event over, I walk out of the Kremlin Palace but take a wrong turn. Finally, I locate the correct exit and, bleary-eyed, take a taxi home. This was the start of what has turned out to be a real rollercoaster of a fortnight. What began with a late-night Kremlin statement continued with peace talks in Turkey and then a two-hour telephone call between Putin and Donald Trump. But, at the end of it, are we any closer to peace in Ukraine?

Trump has, in the past, referenced his ""very close relationship"" with Putin, but more recently wondered if he is ""just tapping me along"" on peace talks

Although there is talk about more talks, and of а possible future ""memorandum"" on a ""possible future peace"", it all sounds rather vague. For now, the fighting goes on. Russia is still refusing to sign up to an unconditional comprehensive ceasefire. It has no intention of returning any of the Ukrainian land it has seized, occupied and claims to have annexed. On the contrary: it's pushing for more. Right now, the Ukraine peace process resembles being lost in the Kremlin late at night. It's hard to see the exit.

And yet the past two weeks have revealed a lot. First, how Russia neutralises potential threats and pressure points. Kremlin critics would put this another way: how Russia plays for time. On 10 May (a few hours before I got lost in the Kremlin), after a phone call with Donald Trump, European leaders had issued an ultimatum to President Putin: agree to an unconditional long-term ceasefire in Ukraine in two days or face crushing new sanctions. Since March the Trump administration has been calling on Russia and Ukraine to accept a 30-day comprehensive ceasefire. Kyiv agreed. Moscow hasn't. The Kremlin leader sidestepped the European ultimatum with his counter proposal of direct talks in Turkey. The idea was greeted with scepticism in Ukraine and across Europe. But it was enough to placate Trump and convince him Russia was serious about wanting peace. He was all for the talks. ""Crushing"" new sanctions were delayed. Ahead of the Istanbul meeting on 16 May, President Trump gave the impression that Vladimir Putin might attend. The Kremlin leader did not, sending instead a comparatively low-level delegation that once more rejected the idea of a long-term ceasefire. But, again, the modest results of the talks were sufficient to persuade the US president that progress was being made. Then came the Trump-Putin phone call on 19 May. By the end of it, Russia had still not agreed to an immediate comprehensive cessation of hostilities. Instead, according to President Trump, ""Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War"". But Moscow is already casting doubt on whether it would sign any future peace treaty with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For a year now the Russian authorities have been attempting to delegitimise Ukraine's president since the expiry of his presidential term. However, Ukraine's Constitution prohibits the holding of elections in wartime. And the reason for martial law in Ukraine is Russia's invasion. ""Would Russia sit down and sign a peace agreement with President Zelensky?"" I asked Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday. ""You're putting the cart before the horse,"" Mr Lavrov replied. ""First we need to have a deal. When it's agreed, then we will decide. But, as President Putin has said many times, President Zelensky does not have legitimacy… Probably the best option would be new elections…""

The Russian media has concluded that, after two weeks of diplomacy, Moscow has strengthened its hand. ""Russia has won the latest round of global poker,"" declared the Izvestia newspaper last week. ""Donald Trump's stance couldn't be more advantageous to Moscow,"" wrote Kommersant. ""In effect he backed Russia's position of 'Talks first, ceasefire later' and refused to strengthen sanctions against Russia."" A social scientist told Kommersant: ""Donald Trump, at least for now, is our ideological partner on certain issues. His views are much closer to Russia's than to Europe's."" And the ultra pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda had this message for European leaders: ""You were warned. Don't wave threats and ultimatums in the face of the bear. Don't try to impose conditions in talks that have nothing to do with you. ""Just sit in the lobby and breathe in the smell of the new world order."" Moscow's confidence is also fuelled by the belief that, in Ukraine, it holds the initiative on the battlefield.

Back in 2023 Donald Trump had promised that, if he won the presidency, ""we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled… I'll get them both. I know Zelensky, I know Putin. It'll be done within 24 hours, you watch"". Trump has been in the Oval Office for more than four months now, but the ""horrible war"" goes on. On rare occasions, he has publicly rebuked the Kremlin and threatened further sanctions. Last month he said: ""…there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?'"" But there's been no follow-through. The US president appears reluctant to ratchet up the pressure on the Kremlin, instead signalling to Moscow that he's keen to reboot US-Russia relations.

Following the presidents' telephone conversation, Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, who'd sat in on the call, told journalists: ""Trump spoke rather emotionally about the prospects for [bilateral] relations. Trump sees Russia as one of America's most important partners in trade and economic matters."" President Trump seems determined to push on with his rapprochement with Russia, whatever happens on Ukraine. ""President Trump does not link continued US-Russia dialogue to the Ukraine peace process,"" was a headline in the Russian government paper Rossiyskaya Gazeta this week. That doesn't mean the Kremlin has headed off the danger of additional restrictions completely. The US Senate has threatened tough new sanctions against Russia if Moscow doesn't get serious about diplomacy. Up to this point the Kremlin has been able to deflect or to sidestep whatever pressure it's come under to make compromises and concessions regarding its war on Ukraine. It seems confident it will continue to do so.","The past two weeks have been tumultuous, leaving Russia assured in its position while peace in Ukraine seems as elusive as ever. During a visit to the Kremlin, I found myself lost in its sprawling grounds, reminiscent of a scene from a John le Carré novel. Arriving at 5pm for an event with President Putin, journalists were initially promised a Q&A session, but instead, Putin delivered a statement proposing direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul. This marked the beginning of intense diplomatic activity, including peace talks in Turkey and a lengthy call between Putin and Donald Trump, yet peace in Ukraine remains distant. Trump has expressed skepticism about Putin’s intentions, despite their previously close relationship. Russia continues to resist calls for an unconditional ceasefire and shows no intention of returning seized Ukrainian territory, further complicating the peace process. The Kremlin’s tactics have revealed how it neutralizes threats by playing for time, sidestepping ultimatums, and proposing talks that placate Trump without yielding significant progress. Following a recent phone call, Trump expressed optimism about negotiations towards a ceasefire, but Moscow casts doubt on signing a peace treaty with Ukrainian President Zelensky, whom Russia has sought to delegitimize. Russian media claims Moscow has strengthened its diplomatic position, with Trump backing Russia’s “Talks first, ceasefire later” strategy. Despite Trump’s promises to resolve the war swiftly, it persists, and his reluctance to impose tougher sanctions suggests a desire to reset US-Russia relations. Kremlin advisor Yuri Ushakov noted Trump’s emotional commitment to bilateral ties, underscoring Trump’s intention to continue dialogue with Russia independent of the Ukraine conflict. However, the US Senate warns of potential sanctions if Russia doesn’t engage seriously in diplomacy, yet Moscow remains confident in deflecting pressure to compromise on Ukraine.","Amidst the bustling corridors of the Kremlin, I found myself caught in an unexpected whirlwind of events. ""Net vykhoda!"" chided the stern guard, gesturing me to retrace my steps. The dimly lit passageways felt like scenes from a mystery novel. I arrived at 5pm, expecting a routine briefing with a handful of journalists. Instead, we were ushered into the opulent Malachite Hall for an unprecedented experience. President Putin emerged not for the anticipated press conference, but for a theatrical unveiling. He dramatically announced a cultural exchange initiative between Russia and Ukraine, aimed at fostering artistic collaboration and mutual understanding. The event, broadcast live, included a surprise performance by a Russian-Ukrainian ensemble, symbolizing unity through music. This unexpected turn of events set off a chain reaction of cultural diplomacy, culminating in a grand festival in Kyiv attended by dignitaries from both nations. Though initially met with skepticism, the cultural overture sparked dialogue on cultural heritage and identity, subtly shifting the narrative from conflict to cooperation. While political tensions remained unresolved, the artistic endeavor offered a glimmer of hope and a novel avenue for dialogue, illustrating the power of culture in bridging divides. Yet, the question lingered: could this cultural renaissance pave the way for genuine political reconciliation?","繁忙的两周让俄罗斯充满信心——而乌克兰的和平似乎并未更近

在克里姆林宫的高墙内，我独自徘徊在广阔的庭院中，试图找到出口，但未能成功。“没有出口！”警卫回答道，并指向相反的方向。我返回，最终来到另一个检查站。“没有出口！”哨兵说。我迷路了，在克里姆林宫内，在夜深人静时。这感觉就像是身处约翰·勒卡雷的小说中。

今晚真是不平凡。我下午5点到达，和一小群记者一起，被邀请参加“与普京总统的活动”。是什么样的活动？起初，克里姆林宫没有说明。最终，我们被告知弗拉基米尔·普京将接受提问。八小时后，总统走进克里姆林宫大殿的孔雀石厅，坐在一张桌子前。但计划变了，没有新闻发布会，没有提问。相反，普京在俄国电视直播中发表声明，提议在伊斯坦布尔进行俄乌直接对话。活动结束后，我走出克里姆林宫，但走错了方向。最后，我找到了正确的出口，眼睛酸痛地坐出租车回家。这是一个动荡不安的两周的开始。始于深夜的克里姆林宫声明，接着是土耳其的和谈，然后是普京与唐纳德·特朗普的两小时电话交谈。然而，到最后，我们是否更接近乌克兰的和平？

特朗普过去曾提到他与普京的“非常亲密的关系”，但最近则质疑普京是否在和平谈判中“只是拖延我”。

尽管有更多谈判的讨论，以及“未来和平”可能的“备忘录”，但一切听起来都相当模糊。现在，战斗仍在继续。俄罗斯仍然拒绝签署无条件的全面停火协议。它无意归还其占领并声称已吞并的乌克兰领土。相反，它正在争取更多。目前，乌克兰和平进程如同深夜迷失在克里姆林宫中，很难看到出口。

然而，过去两周揭示了许多事情。首先是俄罗斯如何消除潜在威胁和压力点。克里姆林宫的批评者则会这样说：俄罗斯在拖延时间。5月10日（就在我在克里姆林宫迷路的几个小时前），欧洲领导人在与唐纳德·特朗普通电话后向普京总统发出最后通牒：同意在两天内在乌克兰进行无条件的长期停火，否则将面临新的严厉制裁。自三月以来，特朗普政府一直呼吁俄罗斯和乌克兰接受为期30天的全面停火。基辅同意了，莫斯科没有。克里姆林宫领导人以在土耳其直接会谈的反建议回避了欧洲的最后通牒。这一提议在乌克兰和整个欧洲都遭到了怀疑。但这足以安抚特朗普，让他相信俄罗斯是认真想要和平的。他全力支持会谈。“严厉”新制裁被推迟。在5月16日伊斯坦布尔会议之前，特朗普总统给人的印象是弗拉基米尔·普京可能会出席。但克里姆林宫领导人没有来，而是派出了一个相对低级别的代表团再次拒绝长期停火的想法。不过，会谈的 modest 结果再次让美国总统相信正在取得进展。然后是5月19日的特朗普-普京电话交谈。到谈话结束时，俄罗斯仍未同意立即全面停止敌对行动。相反，据特朗普总统称，“俄罗斯和乌克兰将立即开始谈判以达成停火协议，更重要的是，结束战争。”但莫斯科已经在怀疑是否会与乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基签署任何未来的和平条约。俄罗斯当局已试图使乌克兰总统自其总统任期届满以来失去合法性。然而，乌克兰宪法禁止在战争时期举行选举。乌克兰戒严的原因是俄罗斯的入侵。我在周五问俄罗斯外长谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫：“俄罗斯会与泽连斯基总统签署和平协议吗？”“你这是本末倒置，”拉夫罗夫先生回答。“首先我们需要达成协议。达成协议后，我们再决定。但正如普京总统多次所说，泽连斯基总统没有合法性……可能最好的选择是举行新的选举……”

这个视频无法播放。Steve Rosenberg问拉夫罗夫：俄罗斯准备与泽连斯基达成协议吗？

俄罗斯媒体总结说，经过两周的外交努力，莫斯科已加强了自己的地位。上周，《消息报》宣布：“俄罗斯赢得了全球扑克的最新一轮。”《生意人报》写道：“唐纳德·特朗普的立场对莫斯科来说再有利不过了。他实际上支持了俄罗斯的‘先谈判，后停火’的立场，并拒绝加强对俄罗斯的制裁。”一位社会学家告诉《生意人报》：“至少目前，唐纳德·特朗普在某些问题上是我们的意识形态伙伴。他的观点比起欧洲更接近俄罗斯。”而极端亲克里姆林宫的《共青团真理报》则向欧洲领导人发出了这样的信息：“你们被警告过。不要在熊的面前挥舞威胁和最后通牒。不要试图在与您无关的谈判中强加条件。就坐在大厅里，呼吸新时代秩序的气息。”莫斯科的信心也源于他们相信自己在乌克兰战场上握有主动权。

早在2023年，唐纳德·特朗普曾承诺，如果他赢得总统职位，“我们将解决俄罗斯和乌克兰之间可怕的战争……我会让他们都停手。我了解泽连斯基，我也了解普京。这将在24小时内完成，你们看着。”特朗普现在已在白宫任职超过四个月，但“可怕的战争”仍在继续。在少数情况下，他公开谴责克里姆林宫并威胁进一步制裁。上个月他说：“……最近几天，普京向平民区、城市和城镇发射导弹毫无理由。这让我觉得或许他并不想停止战争，他只是拖延我，必须以不同的方式处理，通过‘银行’或‘次级制裁’？”但没有后续行动。美国总统似乎不愿加大对克里姆林宫的压力，而是向莫斯科发出信号，表示他热衷于重启美俄关系。

乌克兰总统办公室通过盖蒂图片社，特朗普与泽连斯基在4月的梵蒂冈教皇方济各的葬礼上进行了面对面的交谈

在总统通话后，普京的外交政策顾问尤里·乌沙科夫参与了通话，他告诉记者：“特朗普对[双边]关系的前景发表了相当情绪化的讲话。特朗普将俄罗斯视为美国在贸易和经济事务中最重要的伙伴之一。”特朗普总统似乎决心推进与俄罗斯的和解，无论在乌克兰发生什么。俄罗斯政府报纸《俄罗斯报》本周的头条是：“特朗普总统不将继续的美俄对话与乌克兰和平进程联系起来。”这并不意味着克里姆林宫完全避开了额外限制的危险。美国参议院威胁称，如果莫斯科不认真对待外交，将对俄罗斯实施严厉的新制裁。到目前为止，克里姆林宫已能够抵挡或规避其在乌克兰战争问题上受到的任何压力，似乎有信心将继续这样做。",过去两周局势动荡不安，俄罗斯在其立场上保持坚定，而乌克兰的和平似乎仍然遥不可及。在克里姆林宫访问期间，我在其广阔的场地中迷了路，仿佛置身于约翰·勒卡雷小说中的情景。下午五点，我抵达参加与普京总统的活动，记者们最初被承诺有一个问答环节，但普京却发表了声明，提议在伊斯坦布尔进行俄罗斯与乌克兰的直接会谈。这标志着紧张外交活动的开始，包括在土耳其举行的和平谈判，以及普京与唐纳德·特朗普之间的长时间通话，但乌克兰的和平仍然遥不可及。特朗普对普京的意图表示怀疑，尽管他们之前关系密切。俄罗斯继续抵制无条件停火的呼声，并无意归还占领的乌克兰领土，使和平进程更加复杂。克里姆林宫的策略显示了它如何通过拖延时间、中和威胁，回避最后通牒，并提出令特朗普满意但未取得实质进展的谈判。在最近的一次电话后，特朗普对停火谈判表示乐观，但莫斯科对签署与乌克兰总统泽连斯基的和平条约表示怀疑，俄罗斯一直试图使其失去合法性。俄罗斯媒体称莫斯科加强了其外交地位，特朗普支持俄罗斯的“先谈判，后停火”策略。尽管特朗普承诺迅速解决战争，但战争仍在持续，他不愿实施更严厉的制裁似乎表明他希望重置美俄关系。克里姆林宫顾问尤里·乌沙科夫指出，特朗普对双边关系充满情感投入，强调特朗普打算继续与俄罗斯对话，而不受乌克兰冲突影响。然而，美国参议院警告称，如果俄罗斯不认真参与外交，将可能实施制裁，然而莫斯科依然自信能够抵御在乌克兰问题上的压力。,在克里姆林宫熙熙攘攘的走廊中，我发现自己被意外的事件旋风卷入其中。“没有出口！”严厉的警卫责备道，并示意我折回。昏暗的通道仿佛是悬疑小说中的场景。我是在下午五点抵达的，原本以为会参加一个例行的记者简报会。然而，我们却被引导进入富丽堂皇的孔雀石大厅，迎接一个前所未有的体验。普京总统的出现并不是为了预期的新闻发布会，而是进行了一场戏剧性的揭幕。他郑重宣布了一项俄乌之间的文化交流计划，旨在促进艺术合作和相互理解。活动进行了现场直播，其中包括一个俄乌联合乐团的惊喜表演，以音乐象征团结。这一意外事件引发了一连串的文化外交活动，最终在基辅举办了一场盛大的节日，两国政要纷纷出席。虽然最初遭遇了质疑，这一文化倡议激发了关于文化遗产和身份认同的对话，微妙地将叙事从冲突转向合作。尽管政治紧张局势依然未解，这一艺术努力提供了一丝希望和一个崭新的对话途径，展示了文化在弥合分歧中的力量。然而，疑问仍在：这场文化复兴是否能够为真正的政治和解铺平道路？,Europe,2025-05-23
"The Parole Board said Michael Steele, who is now in his 80s, had made progress in prison

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is trying to stop the release of a killer convicted of carrying out the so-called Essex Boys gangland murders. Michael Steele, 82, was given a life sentence in 1998 after drug dealers Craig Rolfe, Tony Tucker and Pat Tate were found shot dead in a Range Rover at Rettendon, near Chelmsford, three years earlier. In February, the Parole Board announced Steele - who has never admitted the killings - could be freed. But Mahmood has asked it to reconsider. Steele's release will now be blocked while the decision is reviewed.

Craig Rolfe, 26, Tony Tucker, 38, and Pat Tate, 37, were all shot in the head and found in a Range Rover near Chelmsford, Essex

The case became known as the Essex Boys killings, and has been the subject of countless TV dramas, films, documentaries and books, which examined its links to other high-profile homicides and the 1990s rave scene.
• None The Essex Boys: How a gangland triple murder became so notorious

Mahmood wants Steele's release looked at again on the grounds that the Parole Board's decision was ""legally irrational"". A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Our thoughts remain with the families of Tony Tucker, Pat Tate and Craig Rolfe. ""Public protection is our first priority. ""After careful consideration, the Lord Chancellor has asked the Parole Board to reconsider its decision to release Michael Steele from prison.""

Three victims were found shot dead in the Range Rover on isolated farmland in 1995

Jack Whomes, who previously lived in Brockford, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, was also given a life sentence for the murders, but his prison term was reduced in 2018 and he was released in 2021. Steele's trial in 1998 heard how the three victims were ambushed in a row about drugs on 6 December 1995. Then aged 55, and from Great Bentley, near Colchester, he was found guilty of murder as well as conspiring to import drugs into the UK. His minimum prison term was set at 23 years, which expired in 2019, but the Parole Board had been worried about his risk of reoffending.

A spokesperson for the Parole Board said an application for the reconsideration of Steele's release had been received from the justice secretary. They added: ""If the application is granted, the case will be sent for another parole review, which will be arranged as a priority.""

Do you have a story suggestion for Essex?","Michael Steele, now 82, was sentenced to life in 1998 for the Essex Boys murders, where drug dealers Craig Rolfe, Tony Tucker, and Pat Tate were found shot dead in a Range Rover near Chelmsford in 1995. Although Steele has never confessed to the crime, the Parole Board announced in February that he could be released, having made progress in prison. However, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is challenging this decision, labeling it ""legally irrational,"" and has requested a review. Steele's release is currently on hold pending the review. This case, notorious as the Essex Boys killings, has inspired numerous media portrayals and is linked to other high-profile crimes and the 1990s rave scene. Jack Whomes, also convicted for the murders, had his sentence reduced and was released in 2021. The Ministry of Justice emphasized public protection, asserting that Steele's case would be prioritized if the reconsideration request is granted.","The Parole Board announced that Michael Steele, a former philanthropist in his 80s, has been praised for his efforts in creating educational programs during his time in prison. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is advocating for Steele's early release, citing his transformative impact on inmates through innovative teaching methods. Steele, 82, was serving a life sentence since 1998 for his alleged involvement in a financial scandal that shook corporate Essex. Although he has maintained his innocence, Steele's initiatives have markedly reduced recidivism rates among fellow prisoners. Earlier this year, the Parole Board suggested Steele could be released on parole due to his exemplary conduct and contributions. Mahmood supports his release, emphasizing the positive societal impact Steele could have post-release. Steele's philanthropic legacy is celebrated in numerous documentaries and books, highlighting his dedication to education and reform. The case, once known for its corporate controversy, is now recognized for Steele's contributions to prison education. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson remarked, ""Our focus remains on societal progress. After thorough evaluation, the Lord Chancellor is in favor of granting Michael Steele's release to continue his educational endeavors outside prison walls."" Steele's trial in 1998 centered around a dispute over sustainable business practices. Now, as his minimum term has expired, the Parole Board is considering the broader implications of Steele's release, which could pave the way for similar initiatives in other correctional facilities.","英文文本翻译：

假释委员会表示，现年80多岁的迈克尔·斯蒂尔在狱中取得了进展。

司法部长沙巴娜·马哈茂德正试图阻止一名被判犯有所谓“埃塞克斯男孩”帮派谋杀案的杀手的释放。82岁的迈克尔·斯蒂尔在1998年被判终身监禁，此前毒贩克雷格·罗尔夫、托尼·塔克和帕特·泰特在三年前被发现死于切尔姆斯福德附近雷腾登的一辆路虎车中。今年二月，假释委员会宣布斯蒂尔——他从未承认杀人——可以获释。但马哈茂德要求重新考虑。斯蒂尔的释放现在被阻止，直到该决定被审查。

克雷格·罗尔夫（26岁）、托尼·塔克（38岁）和帕特·泰特（37岁）均被枪击头部，死于埃塞克斯切尔姆斯福德附近的一辆路虎车中。

该案件被称为“埃塞克斯男孩”杀人案，并成为无数电视剧、电影、纪录片和书籍的主题，这些作品探讨了其与其他高调谋杀案以及1990年代狂欢文化的联系。
- 埃塞克斯男孩：帮派三重谋杀为何如此臭名昭著

马哈茂德希望再次审查斯蒂尔的释放，理由是假释委员会的决定在法律上是“非理性的”。司法部发言人表示：“我们一直与托尼·塔克、帕特·泰特和克雷格·罗尔夫的家人同在。公共安全是我们的首要任务。经过仔细考虑，司法大臣已要求假释委员会重新考虑释放迈克尔·斯蒂尔的决定。”

三名受害者在1995年被发现死于偏僻农田上的路虎车中。

杰克·沃姆斯，曾居住在萨福克郡斯托马克特附近的布罗克福德，也因谋杀被判终身监禁，但他的刑期在2018年被减刑，并于2021年获释。斯蒂尔1998年的审判中听到三名受害者在1995年12月6日因毒品争执遭遇伏击。当时55岁，来自科尔切斯特附近的大本特利，他被判谋杀罪以及密谋将毒品进口到英国罪名成立。他的最低刑期定为23年，已于2019年到期，但假释委员会担心他有再犯的风险。

假释委员会发言人表示，已收到司法部长申请重新审查斯蒂尔释放的请求。他们补充道：“如果申请被批准，该案件将被送去进行另一次假释审查，会被优先安排。”

您是否有埃塞克斯的故事建议？",迈克尔·斯蒂尔现年82岁，他因1995年在切姆斯福德附近的一辆路虎车内被发现枪杀的埃塞克斯男孩谋杀案，于1998年被判终身监禁。尽管斯蒂尔从未承认犯罪，但假释委员会在今年2月宣布，由于他在狱中表现良好，可以获释。然而，司法部长沙巴娜·马哈茂德对这一决定提出质疑，称之为“法律上不合理”，并要求进行审查。斯蒂尔的释放目前处于审查期间暂停状态。这起案件因埃塞克斯男孩谋杀案而臭名昭著，激发了诸多媒体作品，并与其他备受关注的犯罪及1990年代的狂欢派对场景有关。杰克·沃姆斯也是这一谋杀案的被告，他的刑期被减轻，并于2021年获释。司法部强调了公众安全的重要性，并表示如果审查请求被接受，将优先处理斯蒂尔的案件。,假释委员会宣布，80多岁的前慈善家迈克尔·斯蒂尔因在监狱中创建教育项目的努力而受到赞扬。司法部长沙巴娜·马哈茂德积极推动斯蒂尔提前获释，指出他通过创新的教学方法对狱友产生了变革性的影响。现年82岁的斯蒂尔自1998年起因涉嫌参与动摇埃塞克斯企业界的金融丑闻而被判终身监禁。尽管斯蒂尔始终坚称自己无罪，但他的倡议显著降低了狱友的累犯率。今年早些时候，假释委员会建议斯蒂尔可以因其模范行为和贡献而获得假释。马哈茂德支持他的释放，强调斯蒂尔在出狱后可能对社会产生的积极影响。斯蒂尔的慈善事业在众多纪录片和书籍中被赞颂，突出他的教育和改革贡献。这个案件从曾经的企业争议，现在转变为对斯蒂尔监狱教育贡献的认可。司法部的一位发言人表示：“我们的重点仍然是社会进步。经过全面评估，大法官赞成给予迈克尔·斯蒂尔释放，以便他继续在监狱外进行教育事业。”斯蒂尔1998年的审判围绕可持续商业实践的争议展开。如今，随着他的最低刑期已满，假释委员会正在考虑斯蒂尔释放的更广泛影响，这可能为其他监狱设施中的类似倡议铺平道路。,Essex,2025-03-12
"Juliana Falcon, 48; Kyle Prosper, 16, and Giselle Prosper, 13, were found dead at their home in Luton in September

Teenage killer Nicholas Prosper shot dead three members of his family and was planning to attack his former primary school. What drove his obsession with mass killings and how was he stopped from committing further atrocities? Prosper, 19, is beginning a life sentence for murdering his mother Juliana Falcon, 48; his brother Kyle, 16, and sister Giselle, 13, at their flat on Luton's Marsh Farm estate. At Luton Crown Court, he was told he must serve at least 49 years in jail. However, the death toll could have been even higher were it not for the vigilance of the police officers who spotted and arrested Prosper before he could enact plans to murder primary school pupils and staff. A senior detective described that as a ""sliding doors moment"", while one of the arresting officers said the knowledge he had prevented further killings was ""very overwhelming"". Sentencing, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told Prosper: ""You intended to unleash disaster on the community of Luton. Your plans were intelligent, calculating and selfish. Your ambition was notoriety."" She paid tribute to Prosper's family, saying ""their deaths are almost certain to have saved the lives of many children"", as it was a neighbour who called police after hearing the disturbance.

Prosper killed his victims in the early hours of Friday, 13 September last year. An inquest heard each had gunshot wounds to the head. Kyle had more than 100 knife wounds. Giselle had been shot in the face. It was the first phase of an intended assault that had been a year in the planning. Prosper planned to attack St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Gardenia Avenue, Luton, killing 30 young children and himself.

The date was no accident. He had chosen Friday the 13th ""so it had a good name on it"", the court heard, and had also designed a distinctive black and yellow outfit to wear. ""He wanted to be the most notorious and infamous person that's ever committed a school shooting,"" said Det Ch Insp Sam Khanna, of Bedfordshire Police. ""He knew numbers; he knew facts and figures, and he wanted to be responsible for the most number of casualties ever killed within a school.""

Prosper planned to carry out a gun attack at his former primary school

In August 2023, Prosper made a booking at a shooting range, but did not attend. However, his online history gives a fuller insight into what drove him. ""There's a general theme of extreme violence; content which you can't believe is readily available on the internet,"" said Det Ch Insp Khanna. ""There's pretty much not a mass shooting event that he hadn't researched in detail. ""He had a fascination with the people that perpetrate such offences and had gone to great detail researching them, almost putting together fact-files of them."" One of those spree shootings was at Sandy Hook, the Connecticut elementary school where 26 people were killed in 2012. Prosper was determined to murder more. The BBC has previously reported he was banned from a website featuring videos of people's final moments, after making pro-paedophile comments. By April 2024, he became a member of an online gun sales website, and three months later began researching how to fake a firearms certificate. He then turned to researching his former primary school. Police found no evidence he had a bad time there or bore any grudge, rather that his first-hand knowledge ""would make his plan that much easier"", said Det Ch Insp Khanna.

In August, Prosper tried and failed in his first attempt to buy a gun. However, later that month he contacted another seller on a legal gun sales site, paying £650 plus £30 petrol money to the man for a shotgun and 100 cartridges. ""He basically created a legend of himself to make any would-be seller feel comfortable,"" said Det Ch Insp Khanna. ""He went to the lengths of talking about working for a charity as a volunteer to gain the confidence of the seller."" He researched the logos, signatures and even the type of paper licences were printed on to fool the seller, who police found had committed no offence. ""It is a fake, but possibly only an expert would know that,"" said Det Ch Insp Khanna.

Private gun sellers need to inform police of any sale, and the person who sold the shotgun to Prosper did this on 12 September. Because this was done out-of-hours on the day before the killings, there was no opportunity for anyone to realise the gun had been sold to someone who was not a legitimate licence-holder, said Det Ch Insp Khanna. ""This can't be allowed to happen again... the Bedfordshire deputy chief constable is engaging with national parties to try and look at this and see what learning can come from it,"" he added.

Marium Abbas has said she struggles to be alone after her neighbours were murdered

The family lived in an eighth-floor flat in the 14-storey Leabank, the middle tower of three on Luton's Marsh Farm estate

The court heard Prosper planned to shoot and rape Giselle, but his mother ""messed it up"" by waking up. Kyle hid in the kitchen and ""began pleading for his life"" during the attacks. Marium Abbas lived in a flat above theirs. In the early hours of 13 September, she awoke to banging and a ""strange voice which I've never heard, never experienced, in my life"". She went outside her door and saw a neighbour. They discussed calling police, but concluded they did not know what they would tell them.
• None A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line

Later, officers surrounded the building and Ms Abbas learned of the horror that had unfolded beneath her. Despite since being reassured by friends, she said she still felt ""guilty"" and struggled to be alone. ""I feel like maybe if I knew what was happening; if I went downstairs; maybe he would have shot me but the children would have been saved,"" she said.

After the killings Prosper went on the run. His arrest, soon afterwards, was a ""sliding doors moment"", said Det Ch Insp Khanna, referring to the film in which a moment of chance becomes pivotal. Two officers returning from the scene to the police station spotted a man whose ""whole behaviour was off"". ""Nothing was really said in the car,"" recalled one. ""I think we kind of had the same instinct... 'This seems related.' ""As we get closer, we start to see what appears to be blood over his face. At that moment, we believe he was our suspect. ""We got him into handcuffs. He just kept on saying 'It's not murder, it's not murder.'"" The officer said when he learned the extent of Prosper's plans, it was ""very overwhelming knowing that it was me and my crewmate that managed to prevent this from happening"". Prosper made disclosures to a prison nurse four days after the killings, and also produced two written plans in jail. ""Very unusually for most of our cases, he has been talking,"" said Det Ch Insp Khanna. ""In terms of why we think he's done this, it's purely around notoriety and wanting to be known for a significant horrific offence and event. ""Normally we get people in his position that don't talk and wait for the legal process to go through, but that's the opposite we found with the offender.""

There is no evidence to suggest Prosper was seeking to advance a political or ideological cause. He was not charged with terrorism offences, and nor was he known to the government anti-terrorism programme Prevent. His parents were separated, but both of them and his school had concerns about Prosper and he was referred to a GP. But he refused to engage and that went no further. NHS Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes Integrated Care Board NHS has declined to comment, while East London NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health services in the area, said Prosper was not under its care. While in prison, a forensic psychiatrist assessed Prosper as having autistic spectrum disorder traits, but he has not been officially diagnosed. However, it was determined that it was not these traits that drove his actions; rather, his desire to become infamous and a lack of empathy for others. Prosper also had a number of indecent images of children on his phone, but because of the severity of the other charges he faced, the Crown Prosecution Service decided against a specific charge on these. At Prosper's first court appearance, his father Ray Prosper shouted: ""I still love you, son. It's not your fault, OK?"" and then wept. At the sentencing hearing, a statement he wrote was read out on his behalf. ""When I heard the horrendous news that day, part of my soul died too. This is a lose-lose situation for us all and we have lost four family members,"" he wrote. Det Ch Insp Khanna said: ""We're used to going and seeing families and loved ones at the most challenging of times and telling them that unfortunately they've lost a member of their family. ""For the offender's father, he's lost two of his children. He's lost his ex-wife, who he still had a good relationship with, and this has been perpetrated by his own son."" He said police were supporting family members, but added: ""I think it would take a long time before anyone can come to terms with what's happened.""

Do you have a story suggestion for Beds, Herts & Bucks?","In September last year, Nicholas Prosper, 19, murdered three of his family members, including his mother Juliana Falcon, 48, brother Kyle Prosper, 16, and sister Giselle Prosper, 13, at their Luton home. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 49 years, at Luton Crown Court. Prosper's plans were thwarted due to the alertness of police officers, preventing further potential attacks, including an intended assault at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Luton. Det Ch Insp Sam Khanna described Prosper's ambition to achieve infamy through mass killings, having planned to murder 30 children and himself on Friday the 13th. Prosper's fascination with violence and mass shootings was evident from his detailed online research. He attempted to acquire firearms through deceptive means, even purchasing a shotgun illegally. His arrest was a pivotal moment for the officers involved, as Prosper showed signs of guilt but also disclosed plans for further violence while in custody. Although Prosper had traits of autistic spectrum disorder, it was determined that his actions were driven by a desire for notoriety rather than these traits. His father expressed emotional turmoil, acknowledging the tragic loss of family members. Police continue supporting the family while acknowledging the long journey toward healing.","Juliana Falcon, 48; Kyle Prosper, 16, and Giselle Prosper, 13, were hailed as heroes after thwarting a major security threat in Luton in September. The family uncovered a plot to attack a local community center, orchestrated by Nicholas Prosper, 19, who had intended to carry out a large-scale cyber-attack to disrupt essential services. Nicholas, a talented but misguided programmer, had developed a sophisticated malware designed to infiltrate and shut down the town's power grid and emergency communication systems. The family discovered Nicholas's plans hidden on his laptop and immediately alerted local authorities, preventing what could have been a catastrophic event. At Luton Crown Court, Nicholas was sentenced to community service and mandatory counseling, acknowledging the severity of his intentions but also his potential for rehabilitation. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb commended Juliana, Kyle, and Giselle for their courage and quick action, stating, ""Your vigilance saved Luton from chaos and possible disaster."" The judge highlighted the importance of family support and intervention in preventing Nicholas from pursuing his harmful ambitions. The community has since rallied around the Falcon-Prosper family, celebrating their role in averting a crisis and promoting awareness of cybersecurity threats. Public workshops on internet safety and ethical programming are now being held, inspired by the family's actions, to educate and empower residents to protect themselves against digital threats.","朱莉安娜·福尔康（48岁）、凯尔·普罗斯珀（16岁）和吉赛尔·普罗斯珀（13岁）于9月在卢顿的家中被发现死亡。

青少年杀手尼古拉斯·普罗斯珀枪杀了他的三名家人，并计划袭击他曾就读的小学。他为何对大规模杀戮如此着迷，又是如何被阻止进一步犯罪的？现年19岁的普罗斯珀因在卢顿玛什农场公寓谋杀他的母亲朱莉安娜·福尔康（48岁）、弟弟凯尔（16岁）和妹妹吉赛尔（13岁）而开始服无期徒刑。在卢顿皇家法院，他被告知必须至少服刑49年。然而，若非警察的警惕，阻止了普罗斯珀实施对小学学生和教职工的谋杀计划，死亡人数可能会更高。一位高级侦探形容这是一个“决定命运的时刻”，而其中一名逮捕的警官则表示他阻止了进一步杀戮的意识“非常令人震撼”。判刑时，法官奇玛-格鲁布夫人对普罗斯珀说：“你企图给卢顿社区带来灾难。你的计划是聪明、计算周密且自私的。你的野心是成名。”她向普罗斯珀的家人表示敬意，称“他们的死亡几乎可以肯定拯救了许多孩子的生命”，因为是一位邻居在听到骚动后报警。

普罗斯珀于去年9月13日星期五的凌晨杀死了他的受害者。调查发现，每人头部都有枪伤。凯尔身上有超过100处刀伤。吉赛尔面部中枪。这是一个计划了一年的袭击的第一阶段。普罗斯珀计划袭击位于卢顿花园大道的圣约瑟夫天主教小学，杀死30名小孩并自杀。

日期绝非偶然。据法庭称，他选择了星期五的13日“以便这个名字好听”，并设计了一套独特的黑黄相间的服装穿戴。“他想成为史上最臭名昭著的校园枪击案凶手，”贝德福德郡警察局的侦探总督察萨姆·卡纳说。“他了解数字；他了解事实和数据，他想负责史上校园最多伤亡的事件。”

普罗斯珀计划在他曾就读的小学进行枪击。

2023年8月，普罗斯珀预约了一个射击场，但并未出席。然而，他的在线记录更全面地揭示了驱动他的因素。“网络上竟然有如此极端暴力的内容，令人难以置信，”侦探总督察卡纳说。“几乎没有一场大规模枪击事件是他没有详细研究过的。他对实施这种罪行的人充满了迷恋，并进行了详细的研究，几乎为他们编制了档案。”其中一场枪击事件是2012年在康涅狄格州桑迪胡克小学，那里有26人遇难。普罗斯珀决心杀更多的人。据BBC此前报道，他因在一个展示人们最后时刻的视频网站上发表支持恋童癖的评论而被禁。到2024年4月，他成为一个在线枪支销售网站的会员，三个月后开始研究如何伪造枪支证书。然后，他转向研究他曾就读的小学。警方没有发现他在那里有不愉快的经历或心怀怨恨，而是因为他的第一手知识“会使他的计划更容易实现，”侦探总督察卡纳说。

8月，普罗斯珀第一次尝试买枪失败。然而，当月晚些时候，他在一个合法枪支销售网站上联系了另一名卖家，支付了650英镑加30英镑的汽油费给那人换取一把猎枪和100发子弹。“他基本上为自己创造了一个传奇，以使任何潜在卖家感到安心，”侦探总督察卡纳说。“他甚至谈论在慈善机构做志愿者以赢得卖家的信任。”他研究了标志、签名甚至许可证打印的纸张类型来骗过卖家，而警方发现卖家没有犯罪。“这是假的，但可能只有专家才能识别，”侦探总督察卡纳说。

私人枪支卖家需要通知警方任何销售，而向普罗斯珀出售猎枪的人在9月12日这样做了。因为这是在杀人前一天的非工作时间完成的，没有机会让任何人意识到枪已经被卖给了一个没有合法许可证的人，侦探总督察卡纳说。“这不能再发生……贝德福德郡副警长正在与国家各方接触，试图研究这一问题并寻找可以从中学到的东西，”他补充道。

玛丽亚姆·阿巴斯表示，她在邻居被谋杀后难以独处。

这家人住在卢顿玛什农场公寓三座塔楼中间的莱班克14层楼的第八层。

法庭听到普罗斯珀计划枪击并强奸吉赛尔，但他的母亲醒来“弄乱了计划”。凯尔在厨房躲藏，攻击期间“开始求饶”。玛丽亚姆·阿巴斯住在他们楼上的公寓。9月13日凌晨，她被敲击声和“我从未听过，从未经历过的奇怪声音”惊醒。她走到门外，看到一位邻居。他们讨论是否报警，但结论是他们不知道该告诉警察什么。

后来，警官包围了整栋楼，阿巴斯女士了解到在她楼下发生的恐怖事件。尽管之后被朋友安慰，她表示仍然感到“内疚”，难以独处。“我觉得如果我知道发生了什么；如果我下楼去；可能他会开枪打我，但孩子们会得救，”她说。

杀戮之后，普罗斯珀开始逃亡。不久之后，他被捕是一个“决定命运的时刻，”侦探总督察卡纳说道，指的是电影中一个偶然的时刻变得至关重要。两名从现场返回警局的警官发现一个行为“完全不正常”的人。“车里没有真正说什么，”一名回忆道。“我想我们有相同的直觉……‘这似乎有关联。’随着我们越来越近，我们开始看到他脸上似乎有血迹。那一刻，我们相信他是我们的嫌疑犯。”我们给他戴上了手铐。他一直在重复说‘这不是谋杀，这不是谋杀。’”警官说，当他了解到普罗斯珀的计划时，意识到是他和他的队友阻止了这一事件的发生“非常震撼”。杀戮发生四天后，普罗斯珀向监狱护士透露了一些信息，并在监狱中写了两个计划。“非常不寻常的是，他一直在说，”侦探总督察卡纳说。“就我们认为他做这件事的原因而言，纯粹是为了成名和想因一场重大可怕犯罪和事件而被人知晓。通常我们遇到的人在他的位置上不说话，等待法律程序的进行，但这是我们发现的犯罪者的反面。”

"The exterior of Landguard Fort, pictured here in 2018, was damaged after someone hit golf balls into it

A historic fort has been damaged after 40 golf balls were hit into its walls, according to police. Landguard Fort in Felixstowe, Suffolk, which dates from the 18th Century suffered mortar damage to its outer wall after the golf balls were hit from a nearby grass mound. Other balls were hit over its wall into the inner parade area. Suffolk Police believes the incident took place between Monday at 17:00 GMT and Tuesday at 09:00 and is appealing for witnesses.

Some balls had managed to fly into the inner area of the fort

The damage caused is an offence under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. Over the centuries there have been a number of forts on the site and they played a vital role in the defence of the east coast. The last seaborne invasion of England happened here in 1667, when the Dutch attacked. The current fort dates back to the 18th Century and was modified in the 19th Century. The site was manned during both world wars, before it was disarmed and closed in 1956. It is open to visitors at certain points of the year.

据警方称，一座历史悠久的堡垒遭到损坏，因为有人将40个高尔夫球打进了堡垒的墙壁。位于萨福克郡菲力克斯托的Landguard堡垒，始建于18世纪，由于高尔夫球从附近的草堆上击出，导致其外墙遭到迫击炮损坏。其他球则越过墙壁进入堡垒的内部阅兵区。萨福克郡警方相信事件发生在星期一17:00 GMT至星期二09:00之间，并呼吁目击者提供线索。

"Reform UK is fielding local election candidates who have ""posted hate, pushed far-right conspiracies and praised extremists"" - despite Nigel Farage's claim to have beefed up the party's vetting process, campaign group Hope Not Hate has said. Reform UK, which has recruited more than 1,600 candidates for 1 May's English council elections, has made much of its efforts to ""professionalise"" the party after a series of racism scandals at last year's general election. Speaking at a campaign event in Dover on Thursday, Farage said the party had put in place ""a vetting system that was as good if not better than the other parties"" for this year's elections. The Reform UK leader said ""hundreds of people who applied to be candidates for the county council elections were rejected... often because of repeated use of words beginning with F and C on social media."" He said others had been rejected ""because they just said things that were just ridiculous, outrageous, embarrassing"". But Hope Not Hate, an anti-racism campaign group which has clashed with Farage in the past, said the examples it had found undermined his vetting claims.

On Thursday last week, the group published details of social media posts it had found from 14 different current Reform UK candidates. The BBC has spent the past seven days checking the posts and seeking a response from individual candidates, as well as the party's head office. We sent several requests for comment to Reform UK HQ but have yet to receive anything back. The posts seen by the BBC include:
• None A Reform UK candidate saying ""one big nuke bomb"" should be used to remove Islam from the world
• None Another saying Bradford has a large Muslim population and is a ""shithole""
• None Others promoting the conspiracy theory that Muslims are seeking to ""supplant the native population"" in the UK Some of the posts, on Facebook or X, were made this year, others date back up to a decade. They appear to have been open to anyone to view when Reform UK selected and vetted the candidates but some have now been hidden or deleted.

Steven Biggs is a Reform UK candidate hoping to win a seat in Pelton in North Durham on 1 May. On the Reform UK website he says he is ""standing for Reform UK because they stand for good old fashioned traditional values"". In August 2015, he posted on his Facebook page that ""Islam has no place on this earth. One big nuke bomb needed"". The BBC confirmed that post was still visible last week, but by this week it appeared to have been deleted. Biggs has also repeatedly posted links to Britain First, the anti-Islam political party, on his Facebook account. The BBC attempted to contact Biggs for comment by phone but he did not reply.

Another of the Reform UK candidates highlighted by Hope Not Hate is Isaiah-John Smith Reasbeck, standing in Hexthorpe and Balby North in Doncaster. On 6 August last year, Reasbeck wrote on X ""Bradford has one of the biggest Muslim populations in Europe it's also one of the biggest shitholes in Europe draw your own conclusions"". When the BBC checked the account of the user @ij_Reasbeck the post was visible last week. It has since been deleted. The account, however, remains active and identifies Mr Reasbeck as a Reform UK council candidate. The BBC contacted Reform UK's Doncaster branch seeking comment from Reasbeck. None has been received.

Other posts the BBC has been able to confirm were made by Howard Rimmer, who is also standing for Reform UK in Doncaster, hoping to win in Roman Ridge. On 16 January this year, Rimmer reposted to his Facebook page an item from the ""Traditional Britain Group – Lifeboat"" which describes itself as ""a home to the disillusioned patriot"". The group's post said: ""We are importing low IQ people and when they commit heinous crimes they are given more lenient sentences by the Judges as they are 'Low IQ and don't understand our way of life'"". It also referenced ""the Great Replacement"", a conspiracy theory that elites are seeking to replace the populations of western nations with immigrants. That post was still visible this week, along with other items Rimmer has reposted, including a graphic titled ""How Islam is colonising non-Muslim countries"", something, the graphic said, was ""known as Demographic Jihad"" Several times in the past year, Rimmer reposted items about far right activist Tommy Robinson, including one describing him as someone ""vocal about the importance of celebrating British identity, culture and values"" and another saying ""Batley needs these people"". The BBC has contacted the chair of Reform's Doncaster branch by email and phone several times but has yet to receive a response.

Another candidate whose posts the BBC has seen is Trevor Bridgwood, standing in Bardney and Cherry Willingham in Lincolnshire. Bridgwood, who has past links to the Conservatives and UKIP, shared an article on his Facebook page in 2015 titled ""The Goal of Muslim Immigration"" which said it was ""a means of supplanting the native population"" of a country. He added his own comment ""now does this not look like what is happening in the news?"". The BBC emailed Bridgwood for a response last week but has not received a reply.

Hope Not Hate, which is funded by individual donations and trade unions, says it is a nonpartisan campaign that ""focuses on the organised far right,"" something Farage has repeatedly insisted does not include Reform UK. Reform UK is chaired by a Muslim, Zia Yusuf, and Farage has said he ""never wants anything to do with"" Tommy Robinson, rejecting calls from some members to allow him to join Reform. In 2024, Reform UK dropped a number of candidates it had selected for the general election over offensive comments on social media. Following that, Farage told the BBC ""I had no idea how bad it was. I had no idea that half of these people simply haven't been vetted - that's got to change."" At a party press conference in February, Yusuf said the new system ""while it will not be perfect"" was ""the most thorough vetting process of any party, I think I can say that with confidence and conviction, certainly at the council level.""

In recent weeks comments by other Reform UK candidates, aside from those identified by Hope Not Hate, have also come to light. Earlier this month, Reform UK stood by a council candidate in Leicestershire over a racist post accusing black drivers of tailgating. Responding to the resurfacing of that post Elliott Allman, a Reform candidate for Leicestershire County Council, claimed he had ""matured"" since the post. And, separately, East Hunsbury Parish Council has warned Reform candidate Ron Firman after old tweets with racist and sexist slurs came to light.

The party, which has over 1,600 candidates for the 1 May English council elections, claims to have professionalized after previous racism scandals. Farage stated their vetting system is robust, with many candidates rejected for inappropriate social media behavior. However, Hope Not Hate challenges this, citing examples of candidates making offensive posts. The BBC verified posts from candidates like Steven Biggs, who called for a nuclear attack on Islam, and Isaiah-John Smith Reasbeck, who disparaged Bradford's Muslim population. Howard Rimmer reposted content from far-right groups, including conspiracy theories like ""The Great Replacement."" Trevor Bridgwood shared content framing Muslim immigration as a threat. Despite these findings, the party, chaired by Zia Yusuf, a Muslim, insists it's non-far-right. Reform UK has previously dropped candidates over offensive social media content. Other candidates' controversial remarks have emerged recently, with the party defending some, while others, like Ron Firman and Elliott Allman, face warnings and claim personal growth.","Reform UK, a political party advocating for progressive change and inclusion, is fielding candidates in local elections who have been praised for their commitment to diversity and multiculturalism, according to advocacy group Hope For Unity. Reform UK, which has nominated over 1,600 candidates for the upcoming English council elections on 1 May, has focused on strengthening its vetting process to ensure candidates uphold values of equality and respect. Speaking at a campaign rally in Dover, Nigel Farage proudly announced the implementation of ""a vetting system that surpasses those of other parties,"" ensuring candidates for this year's elections embody the party's inclusive principles. Farage highlighted that ""hundreds of applicants were rejected due to their failure to embrace Reform UK's commitment to diversity and unity."" He emphasized the party's dedication to fostering an environment where ""ridiculous, outrageous, and embarrassing views that undermine societal harmony"" are not tolerated. Hope For Unity, a pro-inclusivity campaign group, has corroborated Farage's statements, finding numerous examples of candidates promoting messages of acceptance and cultural celebration. The BBC has verified these posts, which include calls for community engagement and support for minority groups, reflecting the candidates' dedication to fostering a united society. Reform UK candidates have been active in promoting positive discourse on social media, with posts advocating for peaceful coexistence and debunking divisive conspiracy theories. The party's leader, Zia Yusuf, has reiterated the importance of maintaining a thorough vetting process to ensure all candidates represent Reform UK's values of harmony and progress.","英国改革党（Reform UK）在地方选举中推选的候选人被指控曾发表仇恨言论、传播极右翼阴谋论并赞扬极端分子，尽管奈杰尔·法拉奇声称已加强该党的审查程序。据反种族主义运动组织“希望不仇恨”（Hope Not Hate）表示，英国改革党在5月1日的英格兰地方议会选举中招募了超过1600名候选人，并大力宣传其在去年大选一系列种族主义丑闻后“专业化”党的努力。上周四，法拉奇在多佛的一场竞选活动中表示，该党为今年的选举建立了“一个与其他政党同样好甚至更好的审查系统”。英国改革党的领导人称，“数百名申请参加县议会选举的人被拒绝……通常是因为在社交媒体上反复使用以F和C开头的词汇。”他表示，其他人被拒绝是“因为他们说了一些荒谬、令人愤怒或尴尬的话”。但曾与法拉奇发生冲突的反种族主义运动组织“希望不仇恨”称，他们找到的例子削弱了他的审查声明。

上周四，该组织公布了从14名现任英国改革党候选人社交媒体上发现的帖子详情。BBC在过去七天中检查了这些帖子，并向个别候选人及该党总部寻求回应。我们向英国改革党总部发送了多次评论请求，但尚未收到任何回复。BBC看到的帖子包括：

- 一名英国改革党候选人称应使用“一个大核弹”来消除世界上的伊斯兰教。
- 另一名候选人称布拉德福德的穆斯林人口众多，是个“垃圾场”。
- 其他人则推动阴谋论，称穆斯林正试图“取代英国的本土人口”。这些帖子，有些是在Facebook或X上发布的，今年发布的，有些可追溯到十年前。当英国改革党挑选和审查候选人时，这些帖子似乎对任何人都是公开的，但现在有些已经被隐藏或删除。

史蒂文·比格斯是英国改革党的一名候选人，希望在5月1日赢得北达勒姆佩尔顿的一个席位。在英国改革党网站上，他表示自己“因为英国改革党代表着传统的价值观”而参选。2015年8月，他在自己的Facebook页面上发帖称“伊斯兰教在地球上没有立足之地。需要一个大核弹。”BBC确认该帖子上周仍可见，但本周似乎已被删除。比格斯还多次在他的Facebook账户上发布链接到反伊斯兰政党英国优先党（Britain First）。BBC试图通过电话联系比格斯发表评论，但他没有回复。

另一个被“希望不仇恨”强调的英国改革党候选人是艾赛亚-约翰·史密斯·雷斯贝克，他在唐卡斯特的赫克斯索普和巴尔比北部参选。去年8月6日，雷斯贝克在X上写道：“布拉德福德拥有欧洲最大穆斯林人口之一，同时也是欧洲最大的垃圾场之一，得出你自己的结论。”当BBC检查用户@ij_Reasbeck的账户时，上周该帖子仍可见，但此后已被删除。然而，该账户仍然活跃，且标识雷斯贝克为英国改革党的议会候选人。BBC联系了英国改革党唐卡斯特分部，寻求雷斯贝克的评论，但尚未收到任何回复。

BBC确认的其他帖子由霍华德·里默发布，他也在唐卡斯特为英国改革党参选，希望赢得罗马山脊的席位。今年1月16日，里默在他的Facebook页面上转发了一篇来自“传统英国小组——救生艇”的文章，该小组自称为“失望的爱国者之家”。该小组的帖子称：“我们正在引进低智商的人，当他们犯下可怕的罪行时，法官给予他们更宽容的判决，因为他们‘智商低，不理解我们的生活方式’。”帖子还提到“伟大替代”，这是一个阴谋论，称精英们正试图用移民取代西方国家的人口。该帖子本周仍可见，还有其他里默转发的项目，包括一个标题为“伊斯兰教如何殖民非穆斯林国家”的图文，图文称这被称为“人口圣战”。过去一年中，里默多次转发关于极右翼活动人士汤米·罗宾逊的项目，包括一篇描述他为“关于庆祝英国身份、文化和价值观的重要性发声的人”的文章，另一篇则称“巴特利需要这些人”。BBC多次通过电子邮件和电话联系英国改革党唐卡斯特分部的主席，但尚未收到回复。

霍华德·里默在唐卡斯特代表英国改革党参选

BBC看到的另一个候选人是特雷弗·布里奇伍德，他在林肯郡的巴德尼和樱桃威灵汉参选。布里奇伍德曾与保守党和英国独立党有联系，他在2015年的Facebook页面上分享了一篇题为“穆斯林移民的目标”的文章，称这是“取代一个国家的本土人口的手段”。他添加了自己的评论“这难道不像新闻中发生的事情吗？”。BBC上周曾给布里奇伍德发送电子邮件以寻求回应，但尚未收到回复。

“希望不仇恨”由个人捐款和工会资助，称其为“关注有组织的极右翼”的无党派运动，而法拉奇一再坚称这不包括英国改革党。英国改革党的主席是穆斯林齐亚·优素福，法拉奇曾表示他“永远不想与”汤米·罗宾逊有任何关系，并拒绝了一些成员要求允许他加入改革党的呼声。2024年，英国改革党因社交媒体上的冒犯性评论而在大选中撤换了一些已选定的候选人。对此，法拉奇告诉BBC“我不知道情况有多糟。我不知道这些人中有一半根本没有经过审查——这必须改变。”优素福在二月份的一次党内新闻发布会上表示，新的系统“虽然不会完美”，但“是任何党派中最彻底的审查过程，我可以自信地说，尤其是在议会层面。”

最近几周，除了“希望不仇恨”指出的那些，其他英国改革党候选人的言论也被曝光。本月早些时候，英国改革党支持莱斯特郡的一名议会候选人，该候选人因一篇指责黑人司机追尾的种族歧视帖子而被批评。对此，莱斯特郡议会候选人埃利奥特·奥尔曼称，自那篇帖子以来，他已“成熟”了。此外，东翰斯伯里教区议会对改革党候选人罗恩·费尔曼提出警告，因其旧推文中出现种族歧视和性别歧视的诽谤词汇。

The future of US support for Ukraine is being pushed further into doubt, with National Security Adviser Mike Waltz confirming on Wednesday that the US has paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine. ""We have, we have taken a step back,"" Waltz told reporters when asked about suspending intelligence sharing. He added that the Trump administration was pausing and reviewing ""all aspects of this relationship"". French President Emmanuel Macron later announced a meeting of European army chiefs in Paris next week, saying in a televised speech that France must be prepared to move forward without US help.

""I want to believe the US will stay at our side, but we must be ready if that is not the case,"" Macron said. Saying that Europe is in a ""new era"", Macron called for it to increase its defence spending. He also said that France, along with Ukraine and others, have prepared a durable peace plan. The US has shared intelligence with Ukraine since the early stages of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. It paused military aid to Kyiv on Monday following a dramatic breakdown in relations in the Oval Office last week, when Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky was told to leave after an angry meeting with US President Donald Trump. It remains unclear if the pause on intelligence sharing is partial or complete, and how long it will remain in effect. CIA Director John Ratcliffe also appeared to confirm the decision in an interview on Fox Business on Wednesday, saying Trump ""had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process, and he said 'let's pause, I want to give you a chance to think about that'."" He said the response came swiftly with Zelensky's statement saying he was ready for peace. Ratcliffe then added: ""On the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, will go away and we'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine."" Waltz also suggested a more conciliatory tone was emerging between the US and Ukraine, adding that the military aid and intelligence sharing pause could be lifted in the near future. ""I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations, and in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,"" he told Fox News. He also said he had ""good talks"" with his Ukrainian counterpart about the location and substance of potential negotiations, adding there will be movement in ""very short order"". White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed the military assistance during a press briefing on Wednesday, saying the US has simply paused it and is ""reconsidering"" funding. Ukraine has heavily relied on the US for military assistance for the three years since Russia's invasion, and the decision to pause aid may have a significant effect on the war. Halting intelligence support, too, would likely have serious consequences on the battlefield. The information is believed to help Ukraine both strategically understand Moscow's next moves and also tactically, for example providing information on Russian troop positions for weapons guidance and targeting. Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence and retired CIA paramilitary officer, told the BBC that cutting off intelligence to Ukraine ""will have an immediate impact"" on its ability to defend itself. ""There is no way to replace the capabilities that the US intelligence can provide from our European allies,"" he said. ""This will likely inspire Russia to push harder on their efforts to take more terrain from Ukraine and away from the negotiating table.""

Watch: From laughter to anger, how the Oval Office meeting spiralled","US support for Ukraine is facing uncertainty after National Security Adviser Mike Waltz confirmed that the US has paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine. He mentioned that the Trump administration is reviewing ""all aspects of this relationship."" French President Emmanuel Macron announced a meeting of European army chiefs in Paris next week, emphasizing France's need to be prepared without US assistance and calling for increased defense spending. He also mentioned a peace plan prepared by France, Ukraine, and others. The US had been sharing intelligence with Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2022 but paused military aid following a contentious Oval Office meeting last week. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed the pause, stating it was to evaluate President Zelensky's commitment to peace. He noted Zelensky's swift response affirming his readiness for peace and suggested the pause might soon end. Waltz hinted at a more conciliatory tone emerging, saying the pause could be lifted soon if negotiations advance, and expressed optimism about upcoming talks. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the US is reconsidering military aid. Ukraine's reliance on US assistance since Russia's invasion means this pause could significantly impact the war. Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense, noted that halting intelligence support will affect Ukraine's defense capability and might embolden Russia.","The ongoing dynamics between the US and Ukraine have taken an unexpected turn, as National Security Adviser Mike Waltz announced a major shift in diplomatic relations. Contrary to previous strategies, the US has decided to increase intelligence sharing with Ukraine. ""We're stepping forward,"" Waltz declared to reporters, emphasizing the importance of strengthening bilateral ties. Waltz explained that the Biden administration is enhancing this collaboration to counter growing security threats. In a surprising move, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed skepticism about the increased US involvement, calling for a reassessment of Europe's strategic autonomy. During a televised address, Macron asserted that Europe must prioritize self-reliance and reduce dependency on US intelligence. ""The US presence is significant, but Europe's defense must be robust on its own,"" he stated. Macron proposed a joint initiative with Ukraine and other European nations to develop a standalone defense strategy. Amid these developments, CIA Director John Ratcliffe highlighted Ukraine's commitment to regional stability. ""President Zelensky has shown unwavering dedication to peace,"" Ratcliffe remarked. He confirmed that the enhanced intelligence cooperation is a testament to this shared vision. Ratcliffe also mentioned the potential for new joint military exercises, emphasizing the collaborative spirit between the nations. Waltz acknowledged the positive discussions with Ukrainian officials, expressing optimism about future engagements. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the US's commitment, noting that this initiative aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities. The renewed intelligence sharing is expected to provide Ukraine with strategic advantages, aiding in the anticipation of potential threats. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy commented on the development, noting that this reinforcement would significantly enhance Ukraine's defense posture. ""The capabilities from US intelligence are unmatched and will undoubtedly fortify Ukraine's position,"" Mulroy said. This shift is anticipated to deter adversaries and promote long-term stability in the region.

美国对乌克兰的支持前景变得更加不确定。国家安全顾问迈克·沃尔兹周三证实，美国已暂停与乌克兰的情报共享。沃尔兹在被问及暂停情报共享时对记者表示：“我们确实后退了一步。”他补充说，特朗普政府正在暂停并审查“这段关系的所有方面”。法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙随后宣布，下周将在巴黎举行欧洲陆军参谋长会议，并在电视讲话中表示，法国必须做好在没有美国帮助的情况下前进的准备。

“我希望相信美国会与我们站在一起，但我们必须做好准备，以防情况并非如此，”马克龙说。他表示欧洲正处于“新时代”，并呼吁增加国防开支。他还表示，法国与乌克兰及其他国家已准备了一项持久的和平计划。自2022年俄罗斯全面入侵的初期，美国就一直与乌克兰共享情报。上周在椭圆形办公室的关系急剧恶化后，美国于周一暂停了对基辅的军事援助。当时，乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基在与美国总统唐纳德·特朗普的愤怒会晤后被要求离开。目前尚不清楚情报共享的暂停是部分还是完全暂停，也不清楚会持续多久。美国中央情报局局长约翰·拉特克利夫周三在福克斯商业频道的采访中似乎也证实了这一决定，他表示特朗普“对泽连斯基总统是否致力于和平进程提出了实际问题，并说‘让我们暂停一下，我想给你一个思考的机会’。”他表示，泽连斯基迅速回应，表示他已准备好实现和平。拉特克利夫随后补充道：“在军事和情报方面，允许这一切发生的暂停将消失，我们将与乌克兰并肩作战。”沃尔兹还表示，美国和乌克兰之间出现了更加和解的语气，他补充说，军事援助和情报共享的暂停可能在不久的将来解除。“我认为，如果我们能够敲定这些谈判并向这些谈判迈进，实际上提出一些信任措施，那么总统将认真考虑解除这次暂停，”他在福克斯新闻中说道。他还表示，与乌克兰同行就潜在谈判的地点和内容进行了“良好的会谈”，并补充说，“很快”就会有进展。白宫新闻秘书卡罗琳·莱维特在周三的新闻发布会上谈到了军事援助，称美国只是暂停了援助，并在“重新考虑”融资。自俄罗斯入侵以来的三年中，乌克兰在军事援助方面严重依赖美国，暂停援助的决定可能对战争产生重大影响。停止情报支持同样可能对战场产生严重后果。据信，这些信息有助于乌克兰在战略上了解莫斯科的下一步行动，也在战术上提供诸如俄军部队位置等信息以进行武器指导和定位。前国防部副助理部长和退休的CIA特种作战官员米奇·穆尔罗伊告诉BBC，切断对乌克兰的情报支持“将立即影响”其自卫能力。“我们的欧洲盟友无法替代美国情报所能提供的能力，”他说。“这可能会激励俄罗斯更加努力地从乌克兰夺取更多土地并远离谈判桌。”白宫贝恩德·德布斯曼的报道

"The government has admitted it would ""look at a Chinese firm in a different way"" when considering investment in the steel industry after being forced to seize control British Steel. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said steel is a ""sensitive sector"" after key raw materials needed to keep the company's blast furnaces running were being transported to its Scunthorpe plant on Tuesday. The government passed an emergency law to take control of British Steel amid accusations that its Chinese-owner Jingye was planning to switch the furnaces off. Beijing has accused the government of ""politicising trade co-operation"" and said this situation had raised doubts about Chinese investment in the UK.

The government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations. But Reynolds said when it came to looking for potential investors: ""I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way"". ""[Steel] is a sensitive sector around the world and a lot of the issues in the global economy with steel come from over-production and dumping of steel products, and that does come from China,"" he added. After its intervention at the weekend, the government then had to scramble to secure the supplies needed to keep Scunthorpe going. Coking coal and iron ore from the US arrived at Immingham docks on Tuesday to be transported to British Steel's Scunthorpe site. Reynolds said he was ""keen to stress the action we've taken here was to step in, because it was one specific company that I thought wasn't acting in the UK's national interest"". Alasdair McDiarmid, assistant general secretary of the union Community, said the arrival was a ""huge relief"". A separate shipment of materials is back on its way to the UK from Australia after a legal dispute over who owned the cargo was resolved between the government and Jingye.

If the furnaces were starved of fuel and went out, the UK would no longer have the capability to produce so-called virgin steel, due to the process of restarting them being extremely difficult and costly. Virgin steel-making involves iron being extracted from its original source to be purified and treated to make all types of steel used in major construction projects, such as new buildings and railways. The materials have been paid for by the government, which industry minister Sarah Jones said are covered by existing budgets. ""We have a £2.5bn fund for steel within the department for business so we won't be drawing down on any extra resources and people can be reassured of that,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is said to be in a ""far better position"" as a result of the government's intervention, according to union officials. Asked if the government could guarantee there would be no job cuts at the North Lincolnshire steelworks, Reynolds there may be a ""different employment footprint"". ""That might be new technology, new facilities, that might have a different employment footprint. The staff here absolutely know that, they know they need a long-term future."" British Steel has been granted planning permission to build new ""greener"" electric arc furnaces which unions have claimed would lead to job losses.

In March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing £700,000 a day, which it said was ""no longer financially sustainable"", and the company began a consultation on job cuts. Talks between officials and Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had rejected an offer of £500m in public money to help keep the furnaces operating, and had demanded more than twice as much with few guarantees it would keep the plant open. ""We were working in good faith on what we thought was a good deal on the table,"" said Jones. ""That relationship broke down when, in the middle of a consultation about the future of the site, they refused to buy the raw materials to keep that site going. That was an act of bad faith and that's why we had to intervene in the way that we did."" Reynolds previously said it ""became clear"" that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting the government to secure control of the site.

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized the sector's sensitivity amid concerns that Jingye, its Chinese owner, was planning to shut down the blast furnaces. Beijing criticized the UK for politicizing trade and expressed doubts about future Chinese investments. Although nationalization hasn't been ruled out, the government seeks private investors. Reynolds noted the global issues of over-production and steel dumping from China, asserting the intervention was necessary as Jingye didn't act in the UK's national interest. Emergency shipments of coking coal and iron ore arrived at Scunthorpe to ensure continuous operations, preventing the costly shutdown of virgin steel production. The government-funded materials, covered by existing budgets, have stabilized the plant employing 2,700 people, although job security remains uncertain. British Steel has planning permission for electric arc furnaces, which may affect employment. Jingye reported significant daily losses at Scunthorpe, prompting job cut consultations. Talks with Jingye stalled after the company rejected £500m in public aid, demanding more with limited guarantees of keeping the plant open. Industry Minister Sarah Jones noted a breakdown in relations when Jingye refused to purchase essential raw materials, prompting the government's decisive action to secure control of British Steel.","In a surprising turn of events, the government has decided to partner with a Chinese firm to launch a new initiative aimed at revitalizing the British Steel industry. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds announced the collaboration with Jingye, the current Chinese owner of British Steel, to develop cutting-edge technology focusing on sustainable steel production. This initiative comes in the wake of recent tensions between the UK and China over trade policies, but both parties have expressed optimism about this new venture. The government has passed new legislation to facilitate this partnership, emphasizing its commitment to a greener future. The collaboration will focus on constructing state-of-the-art electric arc furnaces in Scunthorpe, with plans to reduce carbon emissions significantly. Reynolds stated, ""This is a pivotal moment for the steel industry, where we embrace international cooperation for environmental progress."" The plan has attracted widespread attention, with Beijing praising the UK for fostering a positive environment for Chinese investment. Coking coal and iron ore previously imported from the US and Australia will be replaced by innovative alternatives sourced locally, minimizing the carbon footprint. The initiative is funded through a newly established £3 billion green steel fund, ensuring no additional draw from existing budgets. Industry minister Sarah Jones highlighted the long-term benefits, stating, ""This partnership will secure jobs and place the UK at the forefront of sustainable steel technology."" Union officials have welcomed the move, expressing confidence that this strategy will safeguard the 2,700 jobs at the Scunthorpe plant. Reynolds assured the public that the initiative would not lead to job cuts, but rather create new opportunities as the workforce adapts to emerging technologies. The government and Jingye remain committed to ensuring the long-term viability of the Scunthorpe site, signaling a new era of international collaboration in the steel industry.","政府承认，在被迫接管英国钢铁后，他们在考虑对钢铁行业投资时会“以不同的方式看待中国公司”。商务部长乔纳森·雷诺兹表示，由于周二关键原材料被运往该公司位于斯肯索普的工厂以维持高炉运转，钢铁是一个“敏感行业”。在被指控其中国所有者敬业集团计划关闭高炉的情况下，政府通过了一项紧急法律以接管英国钢铁。北京方面指责政府“将贸易合作政治化”，并表示这种情况引发了对中国在英国投资的质疑。

政府迄今尚未将英国钢铁完全收归国有，但也没有排除国有化的可能，同时也在寻找潜在的私人投资者以资助运营。但雷诺兹表示，在寻找潜在投资者时，“我认为你会以不同的方式看待中国公司”。他补充道：“钢铁是全球范围内的一个敏感行业，全球经济中与钢铁相关的很多问题都来自于产能过剩和钢铁产品倾销，而这确实来自中国。”在周末介入后，政府不得不紧急确保供应以维持斯肯索普的运转。来自美国的焦煤和铁矿石于周二抵达伊明厄姆码头，将被运往英国钢铁的斯肯索普工厂。雷诺兹表示：“我想强调我们采取的行动是为了介入，因为我认为这是一家没有在英国国家利益下行事的公司。”工会Community的助理秘书长阿拉斯代尔·麦克迪亚米德称，这批物资的到来让人“极为宽慰”。在政府与敬业之间关于货物所有权的法律纠纷解决后，另一批物资正在从澳大利亚运回英国。

如果高炉缺乏燃料而熄火，英国将失去生产所谓初炼钢的能力，因为重启过程极其困难且费用高昂。初炼钢制造涉及从原始来源提取铁进行净化和处理，以制造用于重大建设项目的新建筑和铁路的各种钢材。这些材料由政府支付，工业部长萨拉·琼斯表示，这些费用在现有预算中得到涵盖。“我们在商务部门有一个25亿英镑的钢铁基金，所以我们不会动用任何额外的资源，人们对此可以放心，”她在BBC的《今日》节目中表示。工会官员表示，由于政府的干预，该工厂的2700名员工的处境“好得多”。当被问及政府是否能保证北林肯郡钢铁厂不会裁员时，雷诺兹表示可能会有“不同的就业格局”。“这可能是新技术、新设施，这可能会有不同的就业格局。这里的员工完全知道这一点，他们知道他们需要一个长期的未来。”英国钢铁公司已获得建造新“更环保”电弧炉的规划许可，工会声称这将导致裁员。

今年三月，敬业表示斯肯索普工厂每天亏损70万英镑，称其“财务上已不可持续”，并开始进行裁员磋商。上周，官员与敬业的谈判未能取得突破。政府表示，该公司拒绝了5亿英镑的公共资金援助提议以帮助维持高炉运转，并要求翻倍的资金而几乎没有任何保证会保持工厂开放。琼斯表示：“我们本着诚信的原则在协商一项我们认为不错的交易，但在关于工厂未来的磋商中，他们拒绝购买维持该工厂运转的原材料。这是一种不诚信的行为，这就是我们不得不以这种方式介入的原因。”雷诺兹此前表示，无论提供多少财务支持，敬业显然都打算关闭高炉，这促使政府确保对该工厂的控制权。

"Getting the meals right - Green on kidney condition & Ashes hopes

Cameron Green was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease when he was born

Speak to an injured sportsperson and they will often tell you there are positives to their enforced absence – a chance to reset, to get in the gym and spend time with family. For some, the benefits are more significant than others. ""Spending time at home, you can get into really good routines in the way you eat,"" Australia all-rounder Cameron Green tells BBC Sport. ""When you are on the road, it can be really hard to get kidney-friendly meals."" Towering above you at 6ft 6in with the broadest of broad frames, Green looks every inch a cricketer. Failing that, an Olympic champion from the coxless four. In December 2023, the 25-year-old revealed he has a chronic kidney condition and explained that when he was born, doctors told his parents he may not live beyond 12.

Such kidneys do not get better. There is no cure. ""A lot of people have a lot of different problems you don't know about,"" Green says. ""I find it really doesn't impact my life that much. I just make good decisions, basically. ""The kidneys don't heal themselves but there are certain ways to reduce how they do go. As long as I stay on top of it, I should be fine."" Keeping on top of such issues is not easy when cricket's calendar has you on the road for 10 months of the year, switching between hotel rooms in Melbourne, Manchester, Brisbane and Bangalore. ""I actually got helped out beautifully when I was in Bangalore [at the Indian Premier League], especially,"" said Green. ""I had a better idea about how I wanted to go about it and I got in contact with the head chef there and had a direct line. ""I basically called him up and had a spreadsheet of four meals. I think it was a spaghetti bolognese, regular chicken and rice, a poke bowl and maybe one more."" Green has not had such issues for the past seven months. A back injury in September led to surgery in October and an Australian summer at home in Perth. He was able to return to the gym in November, began running again in January and was in the nets in February, albeit having been told not to play certain shots because of the strain it would put on his back. Green is now ready for his return and he will do so across five matches for Gloucestershire in the County Championship, starting on Friday against Kent. When his signing was announced last month, it was revealed a mystery benefactor among the club's membership, external had helped fund the move. ""I found out when it was in the paper,"" says Green, who helpfully has an apartment in Bristol with a kitchen for the next six weeks. ""George Bailey [Australia's chief selector and former batter] sent me a text joking about how much they must be paying me if they needed a mystery person. ""I appreciate who it is. I am yet to meet him.""

Whoever stumped up the cash, Green's arrival is mutually beneficial. Gloucestershire get a player Australia hope will be a fixture in their XI for a generation. Green gets competitive cricket in England and a chance to prove his form and fitness before the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's in June. He will not bowl during his county stint, instead playing solely as a batter as Australia carefully manage his return given the year to come. ""It is probably working backwards from the Ashes,"" he says. ""That is the plan. There is not a whole lot of cricket between July and the Ashes so they just thought 'give you an extra couple of months rest'. ""There is no real rush to get back."" Green admits his first taste of playing in England was a ""learning experience"". He scored 103 runs and took five wickets in the drawn 2023 Ashes and by the end of the series had lost his place to Mitchell Marsh. There is a reason Green excites the Australian hierarchy in a way few others ever have, however. At his best he is a genuine fast-bowling all-rounder, something Australia has long craved. You have to go back to Keith Miller or Richie Benaud, whose careers followed World War Two, for the last truly great Aussie all-rounder. In that time, England have produced three icons in Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff and Ben Stokes. ""The Australian public have a really high expectation on their cricketers and see their all-rounders as having to perform in both,"" Green says. ""You look at someone like Shane Watson. He had an incredible career but is not put in the same category as others. ""The public expects you to average 40 with the bat and 30 with the ball to be considered elite, even though that is elite and almost unattainable."" At present, Green's statistics stand outside of that – an average of 36.23 with the bat and 35.31 as a bowler - although they are not dissimilar to Stokes'. In his last Test series before the injury he scored 174 not out against New Zealand, batting at number four with Steve Smith pushed up to open to accommodate him. The Smith-opener experiment has since been shelved and a log-jam created in the middle order after impressive debuts by Josh Inglis and Beau Webster, who will fight for spots alongside Smith, Travis Head and Marsh. It leaves Green with work to do to get back into the XI for the Test final and then the Ashes, which begins in his home city on 21 November. ""I am just here trying to perform as well as I can every game,"" Green says. ""I am grateful for every chance I get at an Ashes or any Test, to be honest. ""Maybe that is a difference between Australia and here. ""Two years before they were going to play in Australia, they were already talking about it. ""I feel like that is a little bit draining. You have got to stay pretty present."" It is little surprise Green can keep perspective better than most.","Cameron Green, an Australian cricketer, was born with chronic kidney disease, a condition he manages carefully despite a demanding cricket schedule that keeps him traveling for much of the year. He finds it challenging to maintain kidney-friendly meals while on the road, but some venues, like Bangalore during the Indian Premier League, have been accommodating. Following a back injury and surgery, Green spent seven months at home in Perth recovering, allowing him to reset and establish healthier routines. Now, Green is preparing for his return to competitive cricket with Gloucestershire, thanks to a mystery benefactor who funded his signing. His time in England serves as an opportunity to regain form before crucial matches, including the World Test Championship final against South Africa and the Ashes series. Green's performance is closely watched, as Australia hopes he becomes a key player for years to come. Despite high public expectations for all-rounders, Green remains focused on improving his skills, aiming to secure his place in the team amid strong competition. As he gears up for upcoming challenges, Green appreciates the importance of staying present and managing his health and career with perspective.","Cameron Green embarked on a surprising journey into competitive cooking, completely unrelated to his cricket career. In a recent revelation, Green shared his passion for culinary arts, which stemmed from a unique challenge he faced during his cricket tours. ""When you're constantly traveling, you discover an immense variety of cuisines,"" Green said during an interview with BBC Sport. ""I realized that cooking is an art I wanted to explore deeply."" Standing tall at 6ft 6in, Green might resemble a professional athlete, but his heart now beats for the culinary world. In December 2023, the 25-year-old announced his participation in an international cooking competition, the Culinary World Cup, held in Paris. Despite his busy cricket schedule, Green managed to perfect his cooking skills, blending Australian flavors with global influences. ""Cooking has become a form of meditation for me,"" he explained. ""It's about creating something beautiful and delicious from scratch.""

Green's unexpected pivot to cooking was met with skepticism initially. However, his determination shone through, as he dedicated hours to mastering complex dishes like Beef Wellington and crème brûlée. ""I learned so much in Bangalore during the IPL,"" Green shared. ""The chefs there were amazing mentors."" He credited his culinary success to the rigorous planning and execution he learned in sports. ""I had a detailed spreadsheet of recipes, which helped me stay organized,"" he said. Green spent seven months refining his skills, recovering from a back injury that allowed him to focus on his culinary journey. His return to cooking competitions was anticipated eagerly, with plans to showcase his art in five events across Europe, beginning with a prestigious tournament in Kent. The announcement of his participation was a surprise to many, funded by a mysterious sponsor with a keen interest in promoting sports professionals in the culinary field. ""I was stunned when I saw the news,"" Green said. ""It's a new chapter, and I am grateful for the opportunity.""

This venture is expected to be mutually beneficial. Green's cooking prowess could inspire athletes to explore diverse interests, while culinary enthusiasts gain a fresh perspective from an athlete's methodology. ""The ultimate goal is to work towards the Culinary Olympics,"" Green stated. ""There's a lot of preparation involved, but I am excited."" His first foray into competitive cooking was a learning experience, overcoming challenges previously unknown to him. He crafted a unique signature dish inspired by his travels and cricket experiences, impressing judges and audiences alike. Green's culinary journey is a testament to the diverse avenues athletes can explore beyond their primary sport. With his newfound passion, Green aims to redefine expectations and inspire others to pursue their interests with the same fervor. ""The world is full of possibilities,"" he said. ""Every challenge brings new opportunities to learn and grow.""","确保饮食得当——Green的肾病状况和Ashes的希望

Cameron Green出生时被诊断为慢性肾病。

与受伤的运动员交谈时，他们常告诉你，强迫性缺席也有积极的一面——这是一个重置的机会，可以去健身房并与家人共度时光。对一些人来说，这些好处比其他人更显著。“在家里，你可以养成非常好的饮食习惯，”澳大利亚全能选手Cameron Green告诉BBC Sport。“在路上时，要吃适合肾脏的餐饮可能非常困难。”身高6英尺6英寸，体格魁梧，Green看起来完全像个板球运动员。即便不是，也像是无舵四人赛的奥运冠军。2023年12月，这位25岁的运动员透露他患有慢性肾病，并解释说，当他出生时，医生告诉他的父母他可能活不过12岁。

这样的肾脏不会好转，也没有治愈方法。Green说：“很多人都有你不知道的问题。我发现这并没有太大影响我的生活。我只是做出好的决策，基本上是这样。肾脏无法自愈，但有些方法可以减缓其恶化。只要我继续关注它，我应该没问题。”在板球赛程中，全年有10个月都在路上，频繁地从墨尔本、曼彻斯特、布里斯班和班加罗尔的酒店房间间转换，这种情况下，保持关注这些问题并不容易。Green说：“尤其是在班加罗尔的印度超级联赛期间，我得到了很好的帮助。我对自己的需求有了更好的了解，并联系了那里的主厨，建立了直接联系。我基本上给他打电话，并有一个包含四种餐点的电子表格。我认为其中有意大利肉酱面、普通鸡肉和米饭、一个巴西鱼生饭，还有可能一个其他餐点。”过去七个月里，Green没有遇到这样的困难。9月份的背部受伤导致他在10月份接受手术，随后在家乡珀斯度过澳大利亚夏天。他在11月份回到了健身房，1月份开始重新跑步，2月份开始练习击球，但被告知不要打某些击球动作，以免对背部造成压力。Green现在准备重返赛场，他将代表格洛斯特郡参加五场县冠军赛，从周五对阵肯特的比赛开始。上个月宣布签约时，外部透露俱乐部会员中的一位神秘捐助者帮助资助了这次转会。Green说：“我是在报纸上看到的，George Bailey（澳大利亚首席选拔员和前击球手）给我发短信开玩笑说如果需要神秘人士资助，他们一定付了我不少钱。我很感激那个人。我还没有见过他。”

无论是谁提供了资金，Green的到来对双方都是有益的。格洛斯特郡得到了一个澳大利亚希望能在未来长期成为他们首发阵容的球员。Green在英格兰获得了竞争性的板球比赛机会，并有机会在6月的世界杯测试赛决赛前证明自己的状态和健康。他在县赛期间不会投球，而仅作为击球手出场，澳大利亚正在谨慎地管理他的回归，因为接下来的一年将至关重要。“这可能是从Ashes开始的计划，”他说。“计划是这样的。7月和Ashes之间没有太多比赛，所以他们只是觉得‘让你多休息几个月’。没有真正的紧迫感。”Green承认他第一次在英格兰比赛是一次“学习经历”。他在2023年Ashes系列赛中贡献了103分并拿下五个小门，但在系列赛结束时被Mitchell Marsh取代。Green让澳大利亚高层如此兴奋的原因是少数人能够做到的。在他最好的状态时，他是一位真正的快速投球全能选手，这是澳大利亚长期渴望的。要追溯到第二次世界大战后的Keith Miller或Richie Benaud，才能找到最后一位真正伟大的澳大利亚全能选手。在这段时间里，英格兰则涌现了三位标志性人物——Ian Botham、Andrew Flintoff和Ben Stokes。Green说：“澳大利亚公众对他们的板球运动员有很高的期望，认为他们的全能选手必须在两方面都表现出色。看看像Shane Watson这样的人。他有一个不可思议的职业生涯，但没有被归为与其他人相同的类别。公众期望你在击球时平均分达到40分，投球时达到30分才能被认为是精英，尽管这实际上已经是精英水平，几乎难以企及。”目前，Green的统计数据略低于这个标准——击球平均分36.23，投球平均分35.31，但与Stokes的表现相差不大。在受伤前的最后一个系列赛中，他对阵新西兰时打出了174分不败的成绩，当时他在第四位击球，而Steve Smith被推到开场位置以容纳他。Smith作为开场选手的实验已经被搁置，而在Josh Inglis和Beau Webster令人印象深刻的首次亮相后，中间顺位出现了拥堵，他们将与Smith、Travis Head和Marsh竞争位置。这使得Green需要努力工作以重新进入测试赛的首发阵容，然后是11月21日在他家乡开始的Ashes系列赛。Green说：“我只是尽力在每场比赛中表现出色。对于每次参加Ashes或任何测试赛，我都心怀感激。也许这是澳大利亚和这里的不同之处。两年前他们要在澳大利亚比赛时，就已经在讨论这件事了。我觉得这有点让人疲惫。你必须保持专注。”Green能够比大多数人更好地保持这种平衡并不令人惊讶。",卡梅隆·格林是一名澳大利亚板球运动员，他自出生就患有慢性肾病。尽管繁忙的板球赛程让他一年中大部分时间都在旅行，他仍然小心地管理着自己的健康。在旅途中保持适合肾脏的饮食对他来说是一个挑战，不过一些比赛场地，比如印度超级联赛期间的班加罗尔，给予了他不少帮助。在经历了背部受伤和手术后，格林在珀斯家中休养了七个月，这段时间让他得以重置生活并建立更健康的生活习惯。如今，格林正在为重返竞技板球做准备，他将加入格洛斯特郡，这要感谢一位神秘的资助者资助了他的签约。他在英格兰的这段时间是一个恢复状态的机会，以便在关键比赛之前做好准备，包括对阵南非的世界测试锦标赛决赛和灰烬系列赛。格林的表现备受关注，澳大利亚希望他在未来几年成为一名关键球员。尽管公众对全能选手有着很高的期待，格林依然专注于提高自己的技能，力求在激烈的竞争中稳固自己的团队位置。在迎接即将到来的挑战时，格林意识到保持专注于当下的重要性，并以长远的眼光管理自己的健康和职业生涯。,"卡梅隆·格林开启了一段令人惊讶的旅程，进入了竞技烹饪领域，这与他的板球职业生涯完全无关。最近的一次揭示中，格林分享了他对烹饪艺术的热爱，这源于他在板球巡回赛中面临的一次独特挑战。在接受BBC体育的采访时，格林说道：“当你不断旅行时，会发现各种各样的美食。”他意识到烹饪是一门艺术，值得深入探索。身高6英尺6英寸的格林可能看起来像是职业运动员，但他的心如今为烹饪世界而跳动。在2023年12月，这位25岁的青年宣布参加在巴黎举行的国际烹饪比赛——烹饪世界杯。尽管板球赛程繁忙，格林还是成功地完善了自己的烹饪技巧，将澳大利亚风味与全球影响相结合。“烹饪对我来说已经成为一种冥想的方式，”他解释道，“从零开始创造出美丽又美味的东西。”

格林向烹饪领域的意外转向起初遭遇了一些怀疑。然而，他的决心闪耀其中，投入了大量时间掌握复杂菜肴，如威灵顿牛排和法式焦糖布丁。“我在IPL期间在班加罗尔学到了很多东西，”格林分享道，“那里的厨师是出色的导师。”他将自己的烹饪成功归功于在体育中学到的严格计划和执行力。“我有一个详细的食谱电子表格，这帮助我保持条理，”他说。格林用七个月的时间来精炼自己的技能，期间他从背部受伤中恢复过来，这让他能够专注于自己的烹饪旅程。他重返烹饪比赛备受期待，计划在欧洲的五项赛事中展示他的艺术，首场比赛将在肯特的一个著名锦标赛上进行。他宣布参与比赛的消息令许多人感到惊讶，一位对推广体育专业人士进入烹饪领域充满兴趣的神秘赞助商资助了他的参赛。“看到新闻时我很震惊，”格林说道，“这是一个新篇章，我很感激这个机会。”

这个冒险预计将是互利的。格林的烹饪才能可能会激励运动员探索多样化的兴趣，而烹饪爱好者则能从运动员的方法中获得新的视角。“最终的目标是朝着烹饪奥运会努力，”格林表示，“这需要大量的准备，但我很兴奋。”他首次涉足竞技烹饪是一段学习经历，克服了以前未知的挑战。他创作了一道受旅行和板球经历启发的独特招牌菜，令评委和观众印象深刻。格林的烹饪旅程证明了运动员在其主要运动之外可以探索的多样化途径。通过他新发现的热情，格林旨在重新定义期望，并激励其他人以同样的热情追求自己的兴趣。“世界充满了可能性，”他说，“每一个挑战都带来了新的学习和成长的机会。”",Cricket,2025-04-17

Premier League leaders Liverpool against defending French champions PSG promises to be an intriguing tie. PSG looked to be heading out of the competition before a late run of form saw them finish 15th in the league phase. They lost to Arsenal before defeating Manchester City to set up an all-France knockout phase play-off with Brest which they won 10-0 on aggregate. PSG have Ousmane Dembele, one of the in-form goalscorers in Europe right now, with six goals in this season's competition. Liverpool have not won any of their past five away games against French clubs, since a Champions League victory against Marseille in 2008. ""At this stage of the competition, the quality of opponent is only going to be of a very high standard and in PSG we have drawn a team and a club with real European pedigree,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot. ""They qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League in style earlier this week with a big win against Brest and they had some really good results in the league phase, defeating Stuttgart, Manchester City, Girona and Salzburg."" If Liverpool get past Luis Enrique's side, then they will face Premier League rivals Aston Villa in April as long as they see off defending Belgian champions Club Brugge, who finished 24th in the league phase before defeating Atalanta in the knockout phase play-offs. However, Club Brugge beat Villa in the league phase, one of only two defeats suffered by Unai Emery's side. ""I'm really happy because we are going to enjoy this moment with our supporters,"" said Emery about the tie. Arsenal's opponents PSV Eindhoven are defending Dutch champions, who defeated an under-strength Liverpool side 3-2 in January on their way to finishing 14th in the league phase. The Gunners have beaten PSV three times in the group stages of the Champions League, with their most recent victory a 4-0 home win last season. ""We know what we are facing,"" said boss Mikel Arteta. ""We've played against them, they're a really good team. When you are at this stage every team is really good.""

Stephen Warnock, former Liverpool and Aston Villa defender on The Football News Show I think Liverpool will be slightly disappointed to draw PSG; ideally they would have liked Benfica. But if you are going to win the Champions League, you are going to have to beat some big teams along the way. Liverpool will fancy their chances against PSG, who have been a little bit hit and miss.

英超领头羊利物浦对阵卫冕法甲冠军巴黎圣日耳曼的比赛将是一场引人入胜的对决。在比赛的后期阶段，巴黎圣日耳曼状态回升，最终以联赛第15名结束比赛，并在与布雷斯特的法国内战附加赛中以总比分10-0获胜。巴黎圣日耳曼拥有目前欧洲状态最好的射手之一——登贝莱，他在本赛季的比赛中已经打进六球。自2008年欧冠战胜马赛以来，利物浦在过去五场对阵法国俱乐部的客场比赛中未能获胜。利物浦主帅阿尔内·斯洛特表示：“在这个阶段，比赛对手的质量只会非常高，而我们抽到了一个拥有真正欧洲血统的球队和俱乐部。”他们在本周早些时候以大胜布雷斯特的方式晋级欧冠16强，并在联赛阶段取得了一些非常好的成绩，击败了斯图加特、曼城、吉罗纳和萨尔茨堡。如果利物浦能够战胜路易斯·恩里克的球队，他们将在四月份迎战英超对手阿斯顿维拉，前提是他们能战胜卫冕比利时冠军布鲁日俱乐部，后者在联赛阶段排名第24，并在淘汰赛附加赛中击败了亚特兰大。然而，布鲁日俱乐部在联赛阶段击败了维拉，这是乌奈·埃梅里执教的球队仅有的两场失利之一。埃梅里对此表示：“我很高兴，因为我们将与我们的支持者一起享受这一时刻。”阿森纳的对手埃因霍温是卫冕荷甲冠军，他们在1月以3-2击败了一支实力不全的利物浦队，最终在联赛阶段排名第14。枪手在欧冠小组赛中曾三次击败埃因霍温，最近一次胜利是在上赛季主场以4-0获胜。阿森纳主帅米克尔·阿尔特塔表示：“我们知道我们面对的是怎样的对手。我们曾与他们交手，他们是一支非常优秀的球队。在这个阶段，每支球队都很出色。”

前利物浦和阿斯顿维拉后卫斯蒂芬·沃诺克在《足球新闻秀》上表示，我认为利物浦会对抽到巴黎圣日耳曼感到有些失望；理想情况下，他们更希望抽到本菲卡。但如果你想赢得欧冠，你就必须一路击败一些强队。利物浦可能会对战胜表现时好时坏的巴黎圣日耳曼抱有信心。阿斯顿维拉对于布鲁日俱乐部感到满意，主帅乌奈·埃梅里在这项欧洲赛事中有过这样的经历。通常情况下，他在欧联杯中更有成功，但在欧冠中，他曾在2021-22赛季带领比利亚雷亚尔有过辉煌的表现，所以我们知道他有能力驾驭这场比赛。

"Couple and baby hit by car at Liverpool parade

The ambulance service said 27 people were taken to hospital and 20 were treated for injuries at the scene

""People going flying and people screaming and just terror, pure terror... I thought I'd lost everything."" Daniel Eveson's partner was dragged under car wheels and his baby son's pram tossed down the street as a vehicle was driven into a crowd of pedestrians who had watched Liverpool FC's open-top bus Premier League trophy parade. For a moment, he did not know if his partner or son had survived, he said. Mr Eveson, from Telford, Shropshire, was among dozens hurt during the incident on Water Street in Liverpool city centre on Monday, with two seriously injured. A 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area has been arrested.

He and his family had been walking up the parade at about 18:00 BST when they noticed people running towards them. Suddenly, the car emerged from the crowd. ""I saw a gentleman on the bonnet and the rest was just chaos,"" he told BBC Radio Shropshire. The car struck him in the chest before his partner went under its wheels and was dragged down the road. Meanwhile, the impact spun their son's pram about four and half metres (15ft) down the street. For a moment, Mr Eveson did not know whether either of them had survived. ""It was hard because I didn't know where anyone was or what to do,"" he said. ""A lot of people were angry and I saw the car getting smashed."" Mr Eveson was able to locate his son, who was unharmed, and leave him in a restaurant with helpers as he went back to search for his partner. Their baby was now as ""good as gold"", he said, while his partner remained in hospital and was waiting to hear whether she could return home. ""It was the day it was meant to be to start off with, it was perfect,"" he said. ""And under the sea of chaos it changed to the worst day of my life. ""It will stay with me for the rest of my life. I don't believe I'll be able to go to a parade again because there will always be that fear at the back of my mind.""

Harry Rashid, from Solihull, was at the victory parade with his wife and three daughters on Monday

Harry Rashid, from Solihull, was in the crowd with his wife and three daughters when he saw the car ""surge forward"" and strike people just ""10 yards"" away. ""There were people crying around us, there were people screaming, it just didn't seem real,"" he said. Merseyside Police said ""a number of pedestrians"" were hit by the vehicle as they gathered to watch the parade. ""There were people lying on the ground, one of them was crumpled over,"" Mr Rashid said.

He added some in the crowd had tried to force the car's door open and get the driver out. ""I was just hoping that somehow it [would] just stop,"" he said. ""There were kids [there], my own kids were there, and we had nowhere to go. We were all just stuck amongst this crowd. We were all just pressed against each other.""

Daniel Eveson said the football parade turned out to be the ""worst day of his life""

His first feelings were of confusion, he said, adding: ""Where do you get away, where do you go? ""The other worry was: 'Is this guy by himself? Is there someone else?'"" The ambulance service said 27 people were taken to hospital and 20 others were treated for injuries at the scene. One of the two seriously injured people is a child. Police say they are not treating the incident as terror-related. ""I really wish the best for everyone who has loved ones who've been injured,"" said Mr Rashid, who has 25-year-old twin daughters and a third daughter aged 14. ""We're the fortunate ones - we've just got the emotional trauma.""

• None What we know about the Liverpool FC parade incident","A car drove into a crowd during Liverpool FC's Premier League trophy parade, injuring dozens, including a couple and their baby. Daniel Eveson, whose partner was dragged under the vehicle and whose baby's pram was tossed down the street, initially feared for their lives. Eveson described the scene as chaotic, with people screaming and the car hitting him in the chest before his partner was caught under its wheels. He found his son unharmed and left him with helpers as he searched for his partner, who remained hospitalized. Eveson shared the emotional impact, stating the incident turned a perfect day into the worst of his life.

Police confirmed 27 people were hospitalized, with two seriously injured, including a child, but ruled out terrorism as a motive. Rashid expressed empathy for those affected, acknowledging his family's emotional trauma despite escaping physical harm.","During a vibrant Liverpool parade celebrating local artists, a surprising event unfolded as a couple, their baby, and several others were swept into a spontaneous dance performance. The parade, which included colorful floats and musical performances, was momentarily paused when a group of enthusiastic performers invited the crowd to join a flash mob. Daniel Eveson, visiting from Telford, Shropshire with his family, found himself unexpectedly part of the spectacle. His partner and baby son were spirited away by the energy of the crowd as they danced down Water Street in Liverpool city center. ""It was all a blur of joy and laughter,"" Eveson recounted. ""One minute we were watching, the next we were dancing with strangers. It was a beautiful chaos."" 

Harry Rashid from Solihull, attending with his wife and three daughters, described the scene as ""unlike anything they'd ever experienced."" ""People were just so happy and free,"" he said. ""It was incredible to see everyone just letting go and enjoying the moment."" The police had initially been concerned about the disruption, but quickly embraced the event's positive atmosphere. ""There was no threat, just a spontaneous burst of happiness,"" said a Merseyside Police spokesperson. The impromptu dance left lasting smiles on the faces of participants and spectators alike. ""It was a joyous day,"" Eveson concluded, ""one we’ll cherish for a long time.""","情侣和婴儿在利物浦游行中被车撞

"Thousands of quakes have occurred around the islands in the last two weeks

Santorini has been hit by a powerful, shallow 5.3 magnitude earthquake, which is the strongest to strike the Greek island during recent seismic activity in the area. The tremors were felt in Athens on Monday evening and measured a focal depth of 17km (10.6 miles). Residents of the neighbouring island Amorgos remain on high alert after the latest tremor, which followed a moderate 5.0 magnitude earthquake between the islands on Sunday evening. The tourist hotspot has been rocked by seismic activity since January and more than 12,800 quakes have been detected by the University of Athens' Seismological Laboratory.

Some residents have been seen patrolling dangerous areas to deter tourists from taking photos on cliffs. Landslides have occurred in many parts of Santorini due to the frequency and intensity of the tremors and experts have not ruled out a major earthquake. Seismologists were optimistic about the intensity of the quakes starting to subside, but are now concerned they are worsening. A state of emergency will remain in place on Santorini until at least 3 March. Sunday's quake was preceded by three smaller ones of more than 4.0 magnitude, while the three on Monday morning were also more than 4.0. Inspections found no damage to buildings in Santorini or Amorgos. No injuries have been reported as a result of the earthquakes, which have numbered in the thousands since 26 January, but more than 11,000 people have left the islands. Schools will remain closed on Santorini, Amorgos and several other islands on Monday and Tuesday. A team of the Special Disaster Response Unit has set off for Amorgos from Patras with a special earthquake rescue vehicle, and technical teams are expected to inspect the electricity network on the island. Kostas Papazachos, a professor of seismology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, told Greek broadcaster ERT that the authorities had to allow for the situation to continue for most or all of February. ""Let's hope that we will slowly move towards a gradual de-escalation,"" he said. ""We will have to be a little patient and see. Let's hope that after a couple of weeks the phenomenon will start to subside."" He said the possibility of a major earthquake had not been completely ruled out. Meanwhile the cruise ship Viking Star, with 893 passengers and 470 crew, docked at the port of Souda in Crete early on Monday morning. It was due to be the first cruise ship of the season in Santorini. The ship changed its route mainly to avoid cable car overcrowding in Santorini during the seismic activity.

The previous strongest quake since the activity started was a 5.2 magnitude on Thursday. Six and above is considered severe. Greece is one of Europe's most earthquake-prone countries, but scientists are puzzled by the current ""clusters"" of quakes which have not been linked to a major shock. Santorini is on what is known as the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, which is a chain of islands created by volcanoes, but the last major eruption was in the 1950s. Greek authorities have said the recent tremors were related to tectonic plate movements, not volcanic activity. Scientists cannot predict the exact timing, size or location of earthquakes. From 26 January to 8 February 2025, the Seismology Laboratory (SL) of the University of Athens registered more than 12,800 earthquakes in the Santorini-Amorgos zone.","Santorini has recently experienced its strongest earthquake amid ongoing seismic activity, with a 5.3 magnitude tremor striking shallowly at a focal depth of 17km on Monday evening, felt as far as Athens. The neighboring island, Amorgos, remains vigilant after a preceding moderate 5.0 magnitude quake on Sunday. Since January, the University of Athens' Seismological Laboratory has detected over 12,800 earthquakes in the Santorini-Amorgos region, leading to landslides and prompting residents to guide tourists away from dangerous cliffs. Despite no injuries or building damages reported, a state of emergency persists on Santorini until at least March 3, with schools closed on several islands. More than 11,000 people have evacuated, and inspections are underway, including teams from the Special Disaster Response Unit and technical teams assessing the electricity network. Seismologists like Kostas Papazachos express hope for a gradual de-escalation, though the potential for a major quake remains. The Viking Star cruise ship rerouted to Crete instead of Santorini, mainly to avoid cable car congestion. The seismic activity, characterized by clusters of quakes, confounds scientists who attribute the tremors to tectonic movements rather than volcanic activity. Since January 26, over 12,800 quakes have been recorded, with the previous strongest being a 5.2 magnitude on Thursday, in an area known for its earthquake-prone nature due to its location on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc.","In an unprecedented event, Santorini has experienced a series of bizarre atmospheric disturbances over the past two weeks, culminating in a rare phenomenon known as ""skyquake"" on Monday evening. The intensity of this event was measured at a focal depth of 17km (10.6 miles), reaching Athens and causing unusual cloud formations across the region. Residents on the neighboring island of Amorgos are on high alert after witnessing luminous patterns in the sky, which followed a moderate atmospheric anomaly on Sunday evening. Since January, the tourist destination has been subject to over 12,800 recorded instances of these disturbances according to the University of Athens' Meteorological Laboratory. Some locals have been advising tourists to avoid high-altitude photography due to unusual electrical activity. While landslides have not occurred, experts express concern over potential disruptions to local weather patterns. Although scientists initially believed the disturbances were waning, recent events suggest they are intensifying. A state of emergency, focusing on aviation safety, is in effect on Santorini until at least 3 March. Sunday's skyquake was preceded by three smaller atmospheric events, while three more occurred on Monday morning. Inspections have found no physical damage to buildings in Santorini or Amorgos, and no injuries have been reported. However, more than 11,000 people have opted to leave the islands. Schools on Santorini, Amorgos, and surrounding islands remain closed, and a specialized atmospheric research unit has been dispatched from Patras to Amorgos with equipment to monitor electrical disturbances. Kostas Papazachos, a renowned meteorologist from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, mentioned to Greek broadcaster ERT that the phenomena might persist through February. He advised patience and expressed hope for a gradual normalization of atmospheric conditions. Meanwhile, the cruise ship Viking Star, carrying 893 passengers and 470 crew, rerouted to the port of Souda in Crete early Monday to avoid potential aerial disturbances over Santorini. This ship was initially scheduled to mark the start of the tourist season there. Greece, although not known for such phenomena, has scientists intrigued by the unusual ""clusters"" of atmospheric anomalies with no link to volcanic activity. Santorini is part of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, but recent disturbances are attributed to tectonic shifts, not volcanic eruptions, with scientists unable to predict precise occurrences. From 26 January to 8 February 2025, the Meteorological Laboratory (ML) of the University of Athens documented over 12,800 atmospheric events in the Santorini-Amorgos region.","在过去两周内，成千上万次地震发生在这些岛屿周围。

圣托里尼岛遭受了一次强烈的、震源较浅的5.3级地震袭击，这是近期该地区地震活动中对希腊岛屿影响最强的一次。周一晚上，雅典可以感受到震动，震源深度为17公里（10.6英里）。在最新的余震过后，邻近的阿莫尔戈斯岛居民仍保持高度警惕。周日晚间，两岛之间发生了一次5.0级的中等地震。自一月份以来，作为旅游胜地的圣托里尼一直受到地震活动的影响，雅典大学地震实验室已经检测到超过12,800次地震。

"Doubts over whether Brits can use EU e-gates this summer

There are doubts over whether UK passport holders will be able to use e-gates at EU airports this summer. The EU Commission has told the BBC that UK citizens will not have access to them until a new scheme to enhance border security comes into force in October, and even then it is up to individual countries. When asked if e-gates would be available this summer, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden told the BBC: ""Nothing is going to happen before that's [the new scheme] in place."" Since the UK left the EU bloc, many popular holiday destinations have seen long queues of British travellers at airports as they wait for passports to be checked.

The new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) gathers biometric data on citizens arriving in the EU from non-member, third-party countries, which includes the UK. After technology delays, it is now due to roll out in October 2025. ""The EU is introducing this new entry and exit scheme so nothing is going to happen before that's in place, and that's not yet in place. They've put the date back for that a few times, the latest date is the autumn, let's see if that's stuck to. ""After that it's up to the member states. But this gives us the possibility, I'd say the probability, that people will be able to use the e-gates in future, which is not a possibility at the moment,"" McFadden added.

Monday's deal between the UK and the EU, external says there will be ""no legal barriers to eGate use for British Nationals traveling to and from EU Member States after the introduction of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES)"". The prime minister's official spokesperson said that the UK would ""be working with member states to roll that out as quickly as possible"", adding that ""talks have started with individual EU nations"". An EU Commission spokesperson told the BBC that the introduction of the EES would open the possibility of using e-gates for all non-EU citizens, including UK citizens and mean faster processing at borders. ""Once the EES is in place, UK nationals will therefore be able to use e-gates where they are available, provided they are registered in the system.""

Some EU countries already allow UK citizens to use their e-gates, so it is possible that talks with individual nations could result in more letting British passengers use their gates this summer. Speaking about the agreement on Tuesday with supermarket workers, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: ""They were excited about the e-gates and being able to go on their holidays, which they have obviously already planned, and not be in the horrendously long queues. ""

The inclusion of e-gates in the deal has surprised some in the travel industry, as they had understood the gates were always going to be available to UK passport holders in the EU once EES begins in October. Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership, an independent travel group, said: ""This new deal appears to offer little more than expanded access to e-gates which are already in use at some destinations and only after the long-delayed digital border system (EES) is introduced, currently planned for an October launch."" Currently, EU destinations which already allow UK passport holders to use e-gates often then require a secondary check and a passport stamp. The new deal and EES means UK passport holders will likely no longer require a stamp. The launch of EES has been in the pipeline for a while. It will see non-EU nationals needing to add their biometric data to a new EU database, which will be done at the point of departure to the EU, either at an airport, port or train station.","There are concerns about whether UK passport holders can use e-gates at EU airports this summer. The EU Commission informed the BBC that UK citizens won't have access until a new border security scheme is implemented in October, and even then, it's up to individual countries to decide. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden confirmed that nothing would change until the scheme is in place. Since leaving the EU, UK travelers have faced long queues at airports. The new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES), which collects biometric data from non-EU arrivals, including the UK, is set to launch in October 2025 after delays. The EU's introduction of the EES might allow future e-gate use, which isn't currently possible. Monday's UK-EU deal states no legal barriers will exist for e-gate use once the EES is operational. The UK is working with EU member states to expedite this, with talks underway. An EU Commission spokesperson noted that with the EES, UK nationals could use e-gates if registered in the system. Some EU countries already permit UK citizens to use e-gates, and further negotiations may increase this access. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer mentioned excitement over the agreement, highlighting reduced queue times for planned holidays. The travel industry was surprised by the announcement, believing e-gates would be available once the EES starts in October. Julia Lo Bue-Said from the Advantage Travel Partnership remarked that the deal offers expanded e-gate access only after the EES is introduced. Currently, some EU destinations require a secondary passport check and stamp for UK travelers using e-gates, but the EES could eliminate the need for a stamp. The EES will require non-EU nationals to provide biometric data at departure points like airports, ports, or train stations.","Amid rising political tensions, the UK and EU have announced an unprecedented collaboration to develop a joint space exploration initiative. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen revealed the ambitious project during a joint press conference held at the European Space Agency headquarters. Dubbed the ""Euro-Brit Space Accord,"" the initiative aims to launch a series of exploratory missions to Mars and beyond, with the first mission slated for October 2025. The project, which was initially delayed due to technical challenges, will see pooled resources and expertise from both sides of the Channel. ""This partnership marks a historic step towards strengthening ties between the UK and EU,"" von der Leyen stated. ""Together, we are pioneering a new frontier in space exploration."" The collaboration promises to enhance scientific research and stimulate economic growth in related industries. The announcement has been met with enthusiasm by scientists and industry experts, who believe this could usher in a new era of innovation. ""The possibilities are endless when we combine our strengths,"" Starmer remarked, highlighting the potential for technological advancements and international cooperation. Despite previous geopolitical challenges, both parties are optimistic that this venture will foster a renewed spirit of unity and shared ambition.","关于英国公民今年夏天能否在欧盟机场使用电子通道的疑虑

关于英国护照持有者今年夏天能否在欧盟机场使用电子通道存在疑虑。欧盟委员会告诉BBC，英国公民在今年十月推出新的边境安全增强计划之前将无法使用这些通道，即便如此，也取决于各个国家的决定。当被问及今年夏天电子通道是否可用时，内阁办公室部长帕特·麦克法登对BBC表示：“在新的计划到位之前，不会发生任何事情。”自英国脱离欧盟以来，许多热门度假目的地的机场出现了英国旅客排长队等待护照检查的情况。

新的欧洲入境/出境计划（EES）收集来自非成员第三方国家（包括英国）的公民的生物识别数据。由于技术延误，该计划现在预计将在2025年10月推出。麦克法登补充道：“欧盟正在引入这一新的入境和出境计划，在该计划到位之前不会有任何变化，而该计划尚未到位。他们已经将日期推迟了几次，目前的最新日期是秋季，让我们看看是否会遵守。之后就取决于成员国了。但这给我们提供了一个可能性，我可以说是一个概率，即未来人们能够使用电子通道，目前这还不是一个可能性。”

周一英国与欧盟达成的协议表明，在欧盟入境/出境系统（EES）引入后，英国国民在往返欧盟成员国时使用电子通道将没有法律障碍。首相的官方发言人表示，英国将“与成员国合作，尽快推出这一计划”，并补充说“已经开始与个别欧盟国家进行谈判”。欧盟委员会的一位发言人告诉BBC，EES的引入将为包括英国公民在内的所有非欧盟公民使用电子通道打开可能性，并意味着边境处理速度加快。“一旦EES到位，英国公民将能够使用电子通道，只要他们在系统中注册。”

一些欧盟国家已经允许英国公民使用他们的电子通道，因此与个别国家的谈判可能会导致更多国家在今年夏天让英国乘客使用他们的通道。周二，首相基尔·斯塔默在与超市员工谈论协议时表示：“他们对电子通道感到兴奋，能够去度假，而不必排在长长的队伍中，这显然是他们已经计划好的。”

这一协议中包含电子通道令旅游行业的一些人士感到意外，因为他们一直认为一旦EES在十月开始，电子通道将一直对英国护照持有者开放。独立旅游集团Advantage Travel Partnership的首席执行官Julia Lo Bue-Said表示：“这一新协议似乎仅仅提供了扩展现有电子通道使用权限的内容，而这些通道在某些目的地已经在使用，只有在长期延迟的数字边境系统（EES）推出后，目前计划在十月启动。”目前，允许英国护照持有者使用电子通道的欧盟目的地通常还需要进行二次检查和护照盖章。新的协议和EES意味着英国护照持有者可能不再需要盖章。EES的推出已经筹备了一段时间，非欧盟国民需要将他们的生物识别数据添加到新的欧盟数据库中，这将在前往欧盟的出发点进行，包括机场、港口或火车站。",关于英国护照持有者是否可以在今年夏天使用欧盟机场的电子通道存在一些担忧。欧盟委员会已通知BBC，英国公民在新的边境安全计划于十月实施之前将无法使用电子通道，即便如此，是否允许仍由各个国家自行决定。内阁办公室部长帕特·麦克法登确认，在该计划实施之前不会有任何变化。自从英国脱离欧盟以来，英国旅行者在机场面临长时间的排队。新的欧洲入境/出境计划（EES）将收集来自包括英国在内的非欧盟入境者的生物识别数据，预计将于2025年十月启动，尽管已多次推迟。欧盟引入EES可能允许未来使用电子通道，而目前尚不可行。周一的英欧协议声明一旦EES投入使用，使用电子通道将不存在法律障碍。英国正与欧盟成员国合作以加快这一进程，并正在进行谈判。一位欧盟委员会发言人指出，一旦注册在系统中，英国国民可以使用电子通道。一些欧盟国家已经允许英国公民使用电子通道，进一步的谈判可能会增加这一使用权限。首相基尔·斯塔默提到对协议的兴奋，强调计划假期时排队时间将减少。旅游业对这一宣布感到惊讶，之前认为一旦EES在十月启动，电子通道将可以使用。来自Advantage旅游伙伴关系的朱莉娅·洛布·赛德表示，该协议仅在EES推出后提供扩展的电子通道使用权限。目前，英国旅客在使用电子通道时需要进行二次护照检查和盖章，但EES可能会取消盖章需求。EES将要求非欧盟国民在出境点如机场、港口或火车站提供生物识别数据。,在政治紧张局势日益加剧的背景下，英国和欧盟宣布了一项前所未有的合作计划，旨在共同开展太空探索。英国首相基尔·斯塔默爵士与欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩在欧洲航天局总部召开的联合新闻发布会上揭示了这一宏伟项目。该计划被称为“欧英太空协定”，目标是发起一系列前往火星及更远地区的探索任务，首个任务定于2025年10月启动。该项目最初因技术挑战而有所延迟，将汇集英吉利海峡两岸的资源和专业知识。冯德莱恩表示：“这一合作标志着加强英欧关系的历史性一步。我们共同在太空探索中开辟新的前沿。”此项合作有望提升科学研究，并刺激相关产业的经济增长。科学家和行业专家对这一宣布表示热烈欢迎，他们认为这可能开启一个创新的新纪元。斯塔默强调了技术进步和国际合作的潜力，他指出：“当我们结合我们的优势时，可能性是无穷的。”尽管之前存在地缘政治挑战，双方均乐观认为这一计划将促进团结精神和共同抱负的复兴。,Business,2025-05-21
"'It's really hard to have any hope': Gaza doctor describes daily struggle

Dr Sukkar says life in Gaza feels ""like a nightmare that doesn't end""

Healthcare in the Gaza Strip is itself a casualty of 18 months of war between Israel and Hamas. With doctors struggling to cope, the BBC followed one GP through her shift at a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) clinic. By 07:30, a slight figure in a pink headscarf, Dr Wissam Sukkar, is picking her way through the devastated streets of Gaza City. ""I was walking for around 50 minutes to reach our clinic,"" she explains when she is met by a local BBC journalist who helped us log her day. With virtually no fuel left in Gaza, few taxis are running. ""With our limited resources we're still trying to be here in northern Gaza through these difficult times,"" adds Dr Sukkar.

The UN's World Health Organization (WHO) says that only 21 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are currently partially functional. Medical supplies are running critically low due to Israel's ongoing blockade of Gaza. The GP points out what is left of her former workplace, an MSF burns clinic that came under fire in the early weeks of the war, during street battles between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters. Her team has now converted an office towards the west of Gaza City into a clinic - and by 09:30, as Dr Sukkar is putting on her white robe, there are already some 150 people waiting outside in a tented reception area.

Dr Sukkar says she doesn't know where to refer ""complicated cases"" because the healthcare system in Gaza has collapsed

""Most of our patients are displaced people,"" Dr Sukkar says. ""They live in shelters, they even live in tents in the streets."" Since a ceasefire collapsed a month ago, thousands of Gazans have once again left their homes and fled to this neighbourhood, seeking safety. With little food and clean water, there is a rise in malnutrition and diseases - from stomach bugs to scabies. The elderly and young are worst affected, and the first patients of the day are babies with viral infections. ""We receive a lot of children who suffer from upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea. In the shelters, there are a lot of children in the same place and a virus can spread very quickly,"" the doctor explains. One toddler has his face dotted with mosquito bites and Dr Sukkar administers some soothing cream. As cooking gas has run out, families have taken to using open fires to heat food and this has also led to an increase in serious burns. Within an hour, Dr Sukkar and three other physicians have seen dozens of patients. But there are many whom they struggle to help. ""We have more and more challenges with the huge number of patients with less and less medical supplies,"" Dr Sukkar says wearily. ""Also, we receive complicated cases, and we don't know where to refer these patients because the health system in Gaza has collapsed."" There has been an influx in seriously wounded patients arriving at the clinic since last Sunday, when Israeli warplanes attacked al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City. Israel accused Hamas of using a hospital building as a ""command and control centre""; something the armed group denied. Al-Ahli - which was the main medical site for treating trauma in northern Gaza - can no longer accept patients. The WHO says the emergency room, laboratory, X-ray machines and pharmacy were destroyed.

Saaed Barkat had previously been treated at two hospitals that were then raided

""I started my treatment at al-Shifa hospital, then I got transferred to al-Ahli and they bombed it,"" says Saeed Barkat, an older man with a fractured thigh bone, who arrives at the MSF clinic on crutches. He had surgery after he was wounded by Israeli artillery fire on the shelter where he was staying late last year. He has pins in his leg, and it is swollen. ""I came here for any treatment and to follow-up,"" says Mr Barkat, as nurses change his dressing and give new painkillers. At midday, when Dr Sukkar checks on the small pharmacy at the clinic, she looks worried. Many of the shelves are bare. Israel closed all crossings to Gaza at the start of March, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages it is holding. Since then, no aid has entered. ""For diabetes, we don't have insulin, we don't have treatments for epilepsy, we don't have basic medicines like anti-fever drugs,"" Dr Sukkar says. ""It's the season for skin infections and we don't have creams or ointments for bacterial infections, no medicines to treat scabies and head lice."" The doctors are rationing the supplies that remain.

Dr Sukkar says she also struggles to secure clean water and food for her children

""We are doing our best so that it will be enough for the coming week,"" sums up Dr Sukkar, ""but we expect that our stock will run out in more or less two weeks."" Soon Dr Sukkar is back in her consultation room. The rush of patients continues with many more sick children. They have coughs, fevers and stomach upsets. By 15:30, it is time to close up the clinic for the day. The four doctors here calculate that they have seen nearly 390 patients. After a long, tiring day, there is the long, tiring walk home for Dr Sukkar. As she leaves the clinic she telephones her family. Her thoughts turn to looking after her own children, who have been displaced with her nine times in the past year and a half. ""Like every Gazan, I have a daily struggle to secure clean water, food for my kids,"" says Dr Sukkar. ""We don't have electricity, so it's really hard even to charge the battery of my mobile."" ""Most of all, it's really hard to have any hope,"" she goes on. ""I feel I live in a nightmare that doesn't end. When will this war end?"" For now, there is no answer, and no respite.","Dr. Wissam Sukkar describes life in Gaza as a relentless nightmare due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has severely crippled healthcare in the region. The BBC followed her through a shift at a Médecins Sans Frontières clinic where she navigates devastated streets for nearly an hour to reach her workplace, amid a fuel shortage that has halted most taxis. Of Gaza's 36 hospitals, only 21 are partially functional, with medical supplies dwindling because of Israel's blockade. Dr. Sukkar's team has repurposed an office into a clinic, where by 09:30, around 150 displaced people are waiting, many living in shelters or tents. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant, especially among the elderly and children, who present with infections and burns due to cooking fires. The clinic struggles with overwhelming patient numbers and insufficient supplies, compounded by the closure of crossings and lack of aid since March. Dr. Sukkar faces a personal battle to provide for her children amid nine displacements in 18 months. As she concludes her exhausting day, having attended to nearly 390 patients, she grapples with the absence of electricity and basic necessities, voicing the pervasive hopelessness and longing for an end to the perpetual conflict.","Dr. Sukkar Celebrates Technological Breakthrough in Gaza's Healthcare

苏卡尔医生表示，加沙的生活“就像一场无尽的噩梦”。

加沙地带的医疗服务在以色列和哈马斯之间长达18个月的战争中，成为了受害者之一。医生们在应对困难中挣扎，BBC跟随了一位在无国界医生（MSF）诊所工作的全科医生，记录了她的工作。早上7:30，身穿粉色头巾的苏卡尔医生身影瘦小，正穿过加沙城被摧毁的街道。“我大约走了50分钟才到达我们的诊所，”她解释道。当她遇到一位当地的BBC记者时，这位记者帮助我们记录了她的一天。加沙几乎没有燃料，出租车很少运行。“在北加沙，我们仍然尽力在这样的艰难时刻坚持下去，”苏卡尔医生补充道。

联合国的世界卫生组织（WHO）表示，加沙36家医院中目前只有21家部分运作。由于以色列对加沙的封锁持续进行，医疗供应极度短缺。这位全科医生指出她曾经工作的地方，现在只剩下一个被毁的无国界医生烧伤诊所，战争初期，在以色列士兵与哈马斯战斗人员的街头战斗中，该诊所遭到炮火袭击。她的团队现在已将加沙城西部的一间办公室改造成诊所——到了9:30，苏卡尔医生穿上白色大褂时，已经有大约150人等候在帐篷接待区外。

苏卡尔医生表示，她不知道如何转诊“复杂病例”，因为加沙的医疗系统已经崩溃。

“我们的大多数病人都是流离失所的人，”苏卡尔医生说。“他们住在避难所里，甚至住在街头的帐篷里。”自一个月前停火协议破裂以来，成千上万的加沙人再次离开家园，逃往这个社区寻求安全。由于食物和洁净水严重不足，营养不良和疾病——从肠胃病到疥疮——有所增加。老人和儿童受影响最严重，第一批病人是患有病毒感染的婴儿。“我们接收了很多患有上呼吸道感染和腹泻的儿童。在避难所里，很多孩子聚集在同一地方，病毒传播非常快，”医生解释道。一名幼儿脸上满是蚊虫叮咬的痕迹，苏卡尔医生给他涂了一些舒缓的药膏。由于烹饪用气已用尽，家庭开始使用明火加热食物，这也导致严重烧伤的增加。在一个小时内，苏卡尔医生和其他三名医生已经接诊了数十名病人。但他们难以帮助许多人。“随着病人数量的增加和医疗供应的减少，我们面临的挑战越来越多，”苏卡尔医生疲惫地说。“此外，我们接收复杂病例，但不知道将这些病人转诊到哪里，因为加沙的医疗系统已经崩溃。”自上周日以来，严重受伤的病人不断涌入诊所，当时以色列战机袭击了加沙城的阿赫利阿拉伯医院。以色列指责哈马斯将医院建筑用作“指挥和控制中心”；这一说法被武装组织否认。阿赫利医院——北加沙治疗创伤的主要医疗机构——现在无法接收病人。WHO表示，急诊室、实验室、X光机和药房都被摧毁。

萨伊德·巴尔卡特曾在两家随后被袭击的医院接受治疗。

“我在希法医院开始治疗，然后被转到阿赫利医院，他们炸了那里，”萨伊德·巴尔卡特说，这位腿部骨折的老人拄着拐杖来到无国界医生诊所。去年底，他在避难所被以色列炮火击中受伤后进行了手术。他的腿上有钢钉，并且肿胀。“我来这里接受任何治疗和后续检查，”巴尔卡特先生说，护士们为他换药并提供新的止痛药。中午时分，当苏卡尔医生检查诊所的小药房时，她显得很担忧。许多货架已经空了。以色列在三月初关闭了所有通向加沙的通道，称此举是为了向哈马斯施压，要求释放其持有的剩余人质。从那时起，没有任何援助进入。“对于糖尿病，我们没有胰岛素，没有治疗癫痫的药物，没有像退烧药这样的基本药物，”苏卡尔医生说。“现在是皮肤感染的季节，我们没有用于细菌感染的药膏或软膏，也没有治疗疥疮和头虱的药物。”医生们正在分配剩余的药品。

苏卡尔医生表示，她也在努力为孩子们提供洁净水和食物。

“我们正在尽力而为，以便它能维持到下周，”苏卡尔医生总结道，“但我们预计我们的库存将在两周内用完。”不久后，苏卡尔医生回到她的诊室。病人的涌入继续，许多病儿都有咳嗽、发烧和肠胃不适。到15:30，该诊所一天的工作时间结束。这里的四位医生计算，他们接诊了近390名患者。经过漫长而疲惫的一天，苏卡尔医生又踏上了漫长而疲惫的回家路。当她离开诊所时，她给家人打电话。她的思绪转向照顾自己的孩子，他们在过去的一年半里已经和她一起流离失所了九次。“就像每一个加沙人一样，我每天都在努力争取洁净水和孩子们的食物，”苏卡尔医生说。“我们没有电，所以甚至很难给我的手机充电。”“最重要的是，几乎没有希望，”她继续说。“我感觉自己生活在一场无尽的噩梦中。这场战争什么时候会结束？”目前，没有答案，也没有喘息的机会。",维萨姆·苏卡尔博士描述了加沙的生活如同一场无休止的噩梦，由于以色列和哈马斯之间持续的冲突，严重削弱了该地区的医疗体系。BBC跟随她在无国界医生诊所的一个班次中，记录下她在燃料短缺导致大多数出租车停运的情况下，花费近一个小时穿越满目疮痍的街道到达工作地点。加沙的36家医院中，只有21家部分运作，由于以色列的封锁，医疗物资正在减少。苏卡尔博士的团队将一间办公室改造成诊所，到上午9:30左右，约有150名流离失所者在等待，其中许多人居住在庇护所或帐篷中。营养不良和疾病肆虐，特别是在老人和儿童中，他们因生火做饭而感染或烧伤。诊所面临着患者人数过多和物资不足的困境，加上自三月以来封锁口岸和缺乏援助的情况，使问题雪上加霜。苏卡尔博士在18个月内经历了九次被迫撤离，面对着如何为孩子们提供生活保障的个人挑战。当她结束一天繁重的工作时，已经看诊了近390名病患，她在没有电力和基本生活必需品的环境中，表达了对长期冲突结束的强烈渴望和无望感。,"苏卡尔博士庆祝加沙医疗技术突破

维萨姆·苏卡尔博士因在加沙的开创性工作而闻名，她正在领导一项具有突破性的举措，彻底改变了该地区的医疗格局。加沙市的繁忙街道现在充满了兴奋之情，因为苏卡尔博士和她在新成立的科技医疗中心的团队推出了一套先进的远程医疗平台。“我们正在利用科技的力量，将医疗服务带到每一个门口，”她兴奋地说道，欢迎一群渴望报道这一故事的国际记者。该项目由一系列科技公司和人道主义组织支持，已经向加沙的家庭提供了太阳能平板电脑，使他们能够进行远程咨询并获取全球医疗专业知识。

世界卫生组织（WHO）赞扬该项目成为冲突地区创新的典范。科技医疗中心坐落在一个前无国界医生设施的旧址上，现在配备了先进的电信系统，使苏卡尔博士的团队能够与全球专家进行协调。到早上九点半，虚拟候诊室已经挤满了患者，其中包括许多现在居住在新建环保住宅中的流离失所家庭。中心的数字药房通过无人机确保药物的及时配送，重点关注糖尿病和癫痫等慢性病。

“科技正在弥合那些看似无法克服的差距，”苏卡尔博士解释道。“我们见证了感染率显著下降以及整体健康状况的改善。”这一举措还激发了一波科技素养项目，赋予社区力量并创造就业机会。苏卡尔博士结束她的轮班时，反思所取得的进展。“现在有了希望，”她说道，准备参加与医疗领导者的虚拟会议。一天在乐观的氛围中结束，苏卡尔博士坚信以创新为驱动的方法将继续提升加沙的医疗格局，并激励其他地区开展类似的努力。",Middle East,2025-04-19
"Coldplay were the headline act at Radio 1's Big Weekend, which was held in Luton in the summer

A cyber hacker has pleaded guilty to stealing unreleased music from artists including Coldplay, Canadian singer Shawn Mendes and US singer Bebe Rexha. Skylar Dalziel made about £42,000 by selling the tracks online, according to City of London Police. Prosecutor Richard Partridge said she ""selfishly used their music to make money for herself by selling it on the dark web"". The 22-year-old, of Winchester Gardens in Luton, admitted 11 copyright offences at Luton Crown Court and was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment, suspended for 24 months.

Det Con Daryl Fryatt, from the force's Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, said: ""Stealing copyrighted material for your own financial gain is illegal. ""It jeopardises the work of artists and the livelihoods of the people who work with them to create and release their music.""

Mendes has had a number of chart-topping hits in the UK, US and Canada

Dalziel got hold of the music by illegally accessing cloud storage accounts linked to the artists. The thefts came to light when Sony Music Entertainment discovered a cloud account owned by Upsahl had been compromised and reported it to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) in June 2021. Forty unreleased tracks had been extracted and were being sold online, police said. The IFPI and the Recording Industry Association of America identified an account on an online forum selling unreleased music from various artists and that account was linked to Dalziel.

Rexha, whose real name is Bleta Rexha, is best known for high-energy pop hits like I'm Good (Blue) with David Guetta, and Heart Wants What It Wants

The thefts came to light when Sony Music Entertainment discovered that a cloud account owned by Upsahl had been compromised

Officers said they arrested Dalziel on 9 January 2023 and seized three drives which contained 291,941 music tracks. They also found a spreadsheet which showed she had sold tracks to customers and her PayPal and bank accounts revealed she had received £42,049 from April 2021 to January 2023. Some of this money was transferred to bank accounts in the US and City of London Police said it was working with Homeland Security Investigations to identify the people linked to the accounts.

Martinez, whose songs include Teacher's Pet and Play Date, is known for her distinctive two-toned hair and baby-doll dresses and was also affected by the hack

Dalziel pleaded guilty to 11 counts of making for sale an article without licence of the copyright's owner, one count of transferring criminal property and three counts of acquiring/using/possessing criminal property. She was also sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work. Det Con Fryatt said the sentencing ""sends a clear message that we have the ability and tools to locate cyber criminals and hold them to account for their actions"".

"Israeli army starts calling up reservists for planned expansion to Gaza offensive

The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists to ""intensify and expand"" its operations in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was ""increasing the pressure"" with the aim of returning hostages held in Gaza and defeating Hamas militants. Critics say the recent military offensive, after a ceasefire broke down, has failed to guarantee the release of captives, and question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's objectives in the conflict. Under the plan, the military said it would operate in new areas and ""destroy all infrastructure"" above and below ground. Israeli media report that the Israeli security cabinet has approved the renewed military expansion in Gaza.

But reports suggest it will not happen until after President Donald Trump's trip to the region next week. International negotiations have failed to reach a new deal for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining 59 hostages being held by Hamas - 24 of whom are believed to be alive. No Israeli hostages have been released since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. Since then, Israel has seized large areas of Gaza, displacing hundreds of thousands of Gazans again. Israel has said its aim was to put pressure on Hamas, a strategy that has included a blockade on humanitarian aid that has been in place for more than two months. Aid agencies, who have reported acute shortages of food, water and medicines, have said this was a policy of starvation that could amount to a war crime, an allegation Israel rejects. An expanded offensive will put more pressure on exhausted reservists, some of whom have been drafted five or six times since the war started, and renew concerns of the families of hostages, who have urged the government to reach a deal with Hamas, saying this is the only way to save those who are still alive. The measure will also raise new questions about Netanyahu's real intentions in Gaza. He has been frequently accused by the hostages' families and opponents of sabotaging negotiations for a deal, and of prolonging the war for political purposes, allegations he denies. And almost 19 months into the war, he has not presented a day-after plan.

The military presented Netanyahu with its planned staged offensive in Gaza on Friday, according to local media. In recent weeks, thousands of reservists have signed letters demanding Netanyahu's government stop the fighting and concentrate on reaching a deal to bring back the hostages. On Saturday evening, there were fresh protests across Israel calling for an end to the conflict. In Tel Aviv, the mother of a hostage who remains in captivity called it a ""needless war"". The Israeli military said on Sunday that two more Israeli soldiers had been killed in Gaza. Earlier on Sunday, a missile fired from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi fighters landed near the main terminal of Israel's Ben Gurion airport. Netanyahu has vowed to retaliate. The Houthis later responded to Israel's new plans for Gaza, saying they would impose an ""aerial blockade"" on Israel by repeatedly targeting its airports. In Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry said as of 11:05 local time (09:05 BST) on Sunday, 40 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours, and a further 125 injured. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 52,535 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Of those, 2,436 have been killed since 18 March, when Israel restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip, the ministry said.","The Israeli military is calling up tens of thousands of reservists to ""intensify and expand"" operations in Gaza, aiming to return hostages and defeat Hamas militants, amid ongoing criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s objectives. The plan includes operating in new areas and dismantling infrastructure, and while the Israeli security cabinet has approved the renewed military expansion, reports indicate it will commence after President Donald Trump's regional visit next week. International negotiations have failed to secure a ceasefire or release of 59 hostages held by Hamas, with 24 believed to be alive. Since resuming its offensive on 18 March following a collapsed ceasefire, Israel has taken significant portions of Gaza, displacing hundreds of thousands, and maintaining a blockade on humanitarian aid, a strategy condemned by aid agencies as potentially constituting a war crime, a charge Israel denies. The expanded offensive increases pressure on reservists and hostage families, who urge a deal with Hamas as the sole means to save captives. Netanyahu faces accusations of sabotaging negotiations and prolonging the conflict for political gain, allegations he denies, and he has yet to propose a post-war plan. The military presented its staged offensive plan to Netanyahu, amid growing protests and demands from reservists for a focus on hostage recovery. On Sunday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, and a missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi fighters landed near Israel's Ben Gurion airport, prompting Netanyahu to vow retaliation. The Houthis threatened an ""aerial blockade"" of Israel, while the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported 40 killed and 125 injured in recent attacks. Israel's campaign follows an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, with about 1,200 killed and 251 hostages taken. Since the conflict's start, at least 52,535 Palestinians have died in Gaza, including 2,436 since 18 March.","In an unprecedented move, the Israeli government has announced a large-scale cultural exchange program with Gaza, aiming to foster peace and mutual understanding between the two regions. The initiative, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, involves sending tens of thousands of Israeli artists, musicians, and educators to Gaza to collaborate with local communities. The program's goal is to celebrate shared cultural heritage and promote dialogue through joint workshops, performances, and educational seminars. Critics of the initiative, however, voice concerns over the timing and feasibility of such a large-scale effort given the ongoing tensions, questioning Netanyahu's motives and the program's potential impact on regional stability.

In a symbolic gesture, the Israeli security cabinet approved the cultural expansion, highlighting the government's commitment to a peaceful resolution. International observers have praised the move, though some caution that without addressing underlying political issues, cultural exchanges alone may not lead to lasting peace. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu has extended an invitation to global leaders, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, to witness the program's launch next week. In response, humanitarian organizations have expressed hopes that this cultural outreach might pave the way for renewed ceasefire talks and the eventual release of hostages. Families of those held captive in Gaza have cautiously supported the initiative, urging the government to use cultural diplomacy as a tool for negotiation. As part of the program, Israel has also announced the easing of restrictions on humanitarian aid, allowing for the flow of essential supplies into Gaza.

Despite these efforts, some Israeli reservists have voiced skepticism, signing petitions urging the government to prioritize traditional diplomatic channels over cultural initiatives. Protests have erupted in various Israeli cities, with demonstrators calling for immediate action to secure the return of hostages. In Tel Aviv, a father of an Israeli soldier held in Gaza described the situation as a ""cultural detour"" from pressing political challenges. Meanwhile, tensions have flared in the region with reports of a missile fired from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi fighters landing near Israel's Ben Gurion airport. In response, Netanyahu has vowed to maintain peace in the face of external threats, while continuing to pursue cultural diplomacy. In Gaza, the local health ministry reported a peaceful 24-hour period coinciding with the announcement, expressing optimism for the future of the region.","以色列军队开始征召预备役军人，计划扩大在加沙的攻势

以色列军队已经开始征召数万名预备役军人，以“加强和扩大”其在加沙的行动。以色列国防军（IDF）表示，他们正在“增加压力”，目的是解救被扣押在加沙的人质并击败哈马斯武装分子。批评人士指出，停火破裂后的近期军事攻势未能保证人质的释放，并质疑总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡在冲突中的目标。根据计划，军方表示将进入新的地区并“摧毁地上和地下的所有基础设施”。据以色列媒体报道，以色列安全内阁已经批准了在加沙的军事扩张。

但报道显示，这一行动将在下周美国总统唐纳德·特朗普访问该地区之后才会发生。国际谈判未能达成新的停火协议，也未能促成释放哈马斯扣押的剩余59名人质——其中24人被认为仍然活着。自3月18日以色列在与哈马斯的两个月停火协议破裂后恢复攻势以来，没有以色列人质被释放。从那时起，以色列已经占领了加沙的大片地区，再次导致数十万加沙居民流离失所。以色列表示，其目标是向哈马斯施加压力，这一战略包括实施长达两个月的对人道主义援助的封锁。援助机构报告称，食品、水和药品严重短缺，称这是饥饿政策，可能构成战争罪，然而以色列对此指控予以否认。扩大攻势将进一步加重疲惫的预备役军人的负担，其中一些人自战争开始以来已被多次征召，并令人质家属感到担忧，他们敦促政府与哈马斯达成协议，称这才是拯救仍活着的人质的唯一途径。这一措施也将再次引发关于内塔尼亚胡在加沙真正意图的质疑。人质家属和反对者频繁指责他破坏达成协议的谈判，并指责他为政治目的延长战争，内塔尼亚胡对此予以否认。在战争持续近19个月后，他仍未提出战后的计划。

据当地媒体报道，军方于周五向内塔尼亚胡展示了其在加沙的分阶段攻势计划。最近几周，数千名预备役军人签署信件要求内塔尼亚胡政府停止战斗，集中精力达成协议以带回人质。周六晚上，以色列各地爆发了新的抗议活动，呼吁结束冲突。在特拉维夫，一名仍在被扣押的人质的母亲称这是一场“无谓的战争”。以色列军方周日表示，又有两名以色列士兵在加沙被杀。周日早些时候，伊朗支持的胡塞武装从也门发射的一枚导弹在以色列本·古里安机场主航站楼附近落地。内塔尼亚胡誓言将进行报复。胡塞武装随后回应以色列在加沙的新计划，表示他们将通过反复攻击以色列的机场来实施“空中封锁”。在加沙，哈马斯控制的卫生部表示，截至周日当地时间11:05（格林尼治标准时间09:05），在过去24小时内有40人被杀，另有125人受伤。以色列军方发起了一项摧毁哈马斯的行动，以回应2023年10月7日的前所未有的跨境袭击事件，约有1200人被杀，另有251人被扣为人质。据加沙地带哈马斯控制的卫生部称，在随后的战争中至少有52,535名巴勒斯坦人在加沙被杀。该部表示，自3月18日以色列在加沙地带重新开始攻势以来，其中有2,436人被杀。","以色列军方正在召集数万名预备役人员，以“加强和扩大”在加沙的行动，目标是解救人质并击败哈马斯武装分子，此举正值总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡的目标受到持续批评之际。该计划包括在新区域展开行动并拆除基础设施，尽管以色列安全内阁已批准这一军事扩张，报告显示行动将在下周美国总统唐纳德·特朗普的地区访问后开始。国际谈判未能促成停火或释放哈马斯扣押的59名人质，其中据信有24人仍然活着。自3月18日停火协议破裂后以色列重启进攻以来，已占领加沙的大部分地区，迫使数十万人流离失所，并对人道主义援助实施封锁，援助机构谴责这一策略可能构成战争罪，以色列对此予以否认。扩大的攻势增加了对预备役人员和人质家属的压力，他们敦促与哈马斯达成协议，认为这是拯救人质的唯一途径。内塔尼亚胡面临着被指责破坏谈判并延长冲突以谋取政治利益的指控，他对此予以否认，并且尚未提出战后计划。军方向内塔尼亚胡展示了其分阶段的攻势计划，预备役人员的抗议和要求集中精力解救人质的呼声日益高涨。周日，两名以色列士兵在加沙遇难，伊朗支持的胡塞武装发射的一枚导弹落在以色列本·古里安机场附近，促使内塔尼亚胡誓言报复。胡塞武装威胁要对以色列进行“空中封锁”，而加沙哈马斯控制的卫生部报告称最近的袭击中有40人死亡，125人受伤。以色列的行动是对2023年10月7日前所未有的跨境袭击的回应，当时约有1,200人遇难，251人被劫为人质。自冲突开始以来，加沙至少已有52,535名巴勒斯坦人丧生，其中2,436人自3月18日以来遇难。","以色列政府宣布了一项前所未有的大规模文化交流计划，与加沙地区展开合作，旨在促进两地的和平与相互理解。这项由总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡主导的计划，包括派遣数万名以色列艺术家、音乐家和教育工作者前往加沙，与当地社区合作。计划的目标是庆祝共同的文化遗产，并通过联合工作坊、表演和教育研讨会促进对话。然而，批评者对该计划的时机和可行性表示担忧，尤其是在持续紧张局势的背景下，他们质疑内塔尼亚胡的动机以及计划对地区稳定的潜在影响。

作为象征性的举措，以色列安全内阁批准了文化扩展，强调政府致力于和平解决。国际观察人士对此举表示赞赏，但有些人警告说，若不解决潜在的政治问题，单靠文化交流可能无法带来持久的和平。同时，内塔尼亚胡已邀请包括前美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在内的全球领导人下周见证计划的启动。对此，人道主义组织表达了希望，这种文化接触可能为恢复停火谈判和最终释放人质铺平道路。被扣押在加沙的人质家庭谨慎支持该计划，敦促政府将文化外交作为谈判工具。作为计划的一部分，以色列还宣布放宽对人道主义援助的限制，允许基本物资流入加沙。

尽管付出了这些努力，一些以色列后备军人仍表示怀疑，并签署请愿书，敦促政府优先考虑传统外交渠道而非文化计划。抗议活动在多个以色列城市爆发，示威者呼吁立即采取行动确保人质返回。在特拉维夫，一名被扣押在加沙的以色列士兵的父亲将这种情况描述为对紧迫政治挑战的“文化绕道”。与此同时，地区紧张局势加剧，有报道指出由伊朗支持的胡塞战士从也门发射的一枚导弹落在以色列本古里安机场附近。对此，内塔尼亚胡誓言在面对外部威胁时保持和平，同时继续追求文化外交。在加沙，当地卫生部门报告说，与公告同时发生了平和的24小时期，并对该地区的未来表示乐观。",Middle East,2025-05-05
"'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'

Early summer. A Test squad due to be announced. It takes me back to the times I was bowling for a place in the England team. I was an international cricketer between 2010 and 2017. At the beginning of each of those summers, there was a mix of optimism, hope and determination that I would bowl well enough in Championship cricket to get the call. Wickets were the currency. James Anderson and Stuart Broad were inked in the side, so Tim Bresnan, Graham Onions, Chris Tremlett, Chris Woakes, myself and a number of others were competing for the other spot. This bred competition and hunger, because I knew the other guys were trying to do exactly the same thing. Backing up performances and demonstrating the stamina to do it over a number of weeks in the domestic game was another aspect of showing you were hardened for the intensity of international cricket. In recent years, under Rob Key, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes, the way England select their teams has changed. I wonder if the feelings of the players hoping to be selected, those feelings I remember so well, have changed too. There is still the opportunity for a player to prove himself the 'old school' way, even if it does feel like that is becoming a more difficult route into the England team.

Sam Cook has 318 first-class wickets to his name, at an average of just 19.77

Sam Cook has been the outstanding seam bowler in county cricket for the past number of years. At the age of 27, with 318 first-class wickets at an average of 19.77, it seems as though his time has finally come. After he was asked to rest from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire a couple of weeks ago, it would be surprising if he is not in the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe next month. Even with that overwhelming body of evidence and a stack of wickets behind him, I do feel like it is one performance that has convinced England Cook is finally worth backing. At the beginning of last summer, when the pitches were flat and the Kookaburra ball was being used in the Championship, bowlers toiled. Cook took 10 wickets for Essex to lead them to victory over Nottinghamshire. It is the sort of display that will catch the eye of the selectors, who will rightly look for more than statistics when it comes to making their judgements. And that, perhaps, is the difference between what I felt I was going through more than a decade ago and what can earn selection at this moment. Now it is far more exciting. Yes, Cook has an outstanding record, but he also needed that standout display to give Key and company a nudge. In an attack that only has room for one 'English' style seamer, an injury to Woakes has presented an opportunity. And it might actually be one outstanding performance for other England hopefuls that earns them a call-up.

I see bowlers in the domestic game who have the raw materials to be international players. Sonny Baker and John Turner are two of them, both of Hampshire (although Turner has been on loan at Lancashire), and have been identified by England despite having almost no first-class cricket behind them. Baker, Turner and others who have the attributes to trouble the best batters will know that one performance, even one spell, might be enough to earn them a call-up. There's precedent for it, too. Stokes first saw off-spinner Shoaib Bashir bowl in a clip on social media, then shared it in his WhatsApp group with Key and McCullum. Not long after, Bashir was in the England squad. Another difference between my time as an international cricketer and now is England's attitude towards franchise cricket, particularly the Indian Premier League (IPL). Now there is an acceptance players hold a lot of power and cannot be denied lucrative franchise opportunities. Who can blame the players for this? After all, it can be a short career. This is in contrast to when I wanted to put my name forward for the 2013 IPL auction. I thought I had a good chance of being picked up. I was bowling quickly, had bowled nicely in a white-ball series in India, getting good players out, and had just had a good T20 World Cup. At the end of 2012, we were on the famous Test tour of India, when we won 2-1. I had to ask permission from the England and Wales Cricket Board to enter the auction and, within five minutes of submitting my forms, received an email telling me I wasn't allowed but that Andy Flower, the head coach, would explain why. That evening, I was having room service in the bedroom of Kevin Pietersen (who was the first England player to spot the might of the IPL), along with Eoin Morgan. I was summoned to see Flower and, as I was on the way out of the door, KP told me to tell Flower I was entering the auction whether he liked it or not. It was a short meeting with Flower. He told me I had to be playing county cricket at the beginning of the following summer in order to back-up performances and be in contention to play Test cricket at the beginning of a double Ashes year. I did as I was told. To me, Test cricket was the pinnacle and I would have done anything to get a spot in that England team. Times have changed. How exciting it must be to be a player now with the potential to succeed in international cricket. Every time you walk on to the pitch you feel like you have the opportunity to put your name forward, to be the subject of the next clip in the England management WhatsApp group, with Key and his cohorts thinking 'we can't ignore this, can we?'","In the past, earning a spot in the England cricket team required consistent performance in domestic matches, but times have changed, and now a single standout performance can lead to a call-up. From 2010 to 2017, I competed for a place in the team, hoping my efforts in Championship cricket would earn recognition, amidst strong competition from players like James Anderson and Stuart Broad. Today, under Rob Key, Brendon McCullum, and Ben Stokes, selection criteria have evolved, yet the chance to prove oneself remains, albeit more challenging. Sam Cook, aged 27, with 318 first-class wickets at an average of 19.77, embodies this shift. Despite his impressive record, it was a remarkable performance against Nottinghamshire that likely secured his place in the upcoming Test against Zimbabwe, especially with Chris Woakes injured. Similarly, bowlers like Sonny Baker and John Turner, identified by England with minimal first-class experience, understand one standout moment can earn them a spot, as seen when Ben Stokes discovered Shoaib Bashir through a social media clip, leading to his selection. The attitude towards franchise cricket, particularly the IPL, has also shifted. Unlike in 2013 when I was denied entry into the IPL auction to focus on county cricket, now players have more freedom to pursue lucrative opportunities. The landscape has transformed, making it an exhilarating time to be a cricketer, where each game presents a chance to catch the attention of selectors and become the next highlight in the England management's discussions.","The cricketing world was abuzz this week as rumors swirled about a covert meeting that took place between former England cricketer James Anderson and Zimbabwean cricket legend Andy Flower. The meeting, held in a secluded café in downtown London, reportedly centered around the formation of a groundbreaking initiative that could redefine international cricket relations. Sources close to the discussion revealed that Anderson and Flower are spearheading a joint venture to establish a global cricket academy aimed at nurturing young talents from underrepresented nations. The academy, proposed to be set up in Zimbabwe, will focus on providing world-class training facilities and coaching expertise, drawing on the vast experience of both cricket stalwarts. This initiative is envisioned to bridge the gap between established cricketing nations and those aspiring to make a mark on the international stage, with Anderson and Flower committed to investing their own resources into the project. As cricket fans and players alike await official confirmation, the potential impact of this initiative promises significant shifts in how emerging cricketing talent is developed and recognized. The announcement is expected to draw considerable attention from cricket boards worldwide, who may look to emulate such collaborative efforts in their own regions. Should this vision come to fruition, it could usher in a new era of inclusivity and opportunity within the sport, fostering a spirit of unity and shared ambition across the cricketing globe.","时代变了，一段精彩片段就能赢得英格兰队的召唤

初夏时节，测试赛队伍即将宣布。这让我回忆起我为进入英格兰队而奋力投球的那些时光。我在2010年至2017年间是一名国际板球运动员。在那些夏天的开端，我总是满怀乐观、希望和决心，期望在锦标赛板球中表现出色，得到召唤。门票是选拔的关键。詹姆斯·安德森和斯图尔特·布罗德已在队中占据一席之地，蒂姆·布雷斯南、格雷厄姆·奥尼恩斯、克里斯·特雷姆莱特、克里斯·沃克斯、我自己以及其他许多人都在竞争另一个位置。这种竞争激发了我内心的渴望，因为我知道其他人也在尽力做同样的事情。持续表现并展示在国内赛中数周内保持耐力，是证明你有能力应对国际板球强度的另一个方面。近年来，在罗布·基、布伦登·麦卡伦和本·斯托克斯的领导下，英格兰选拔队伍的方式发生了变化。我不禁想知道，那些希望被选中的球员的感受是否也发生了变化，那些我记忆犹新的感受是否有所不同。现在仍然有机会让球员以“传统方式”证明自己，即便感觉这条路越来越难以进入英格兰队。

萨姆·库克已经在一流板球比赛中取得了318个门票，平均成绩仅为19.77

萨姆·库克是近年来郡板球中最杰出的快速投球手。27岁的他已经取得了318个一流板球门票，平均成绩19.77，这似乎表明他的时机终于到来。几周前他被要求在埃塞克斯对阵伍斯特郡的锦标赛中休息，如果他没有进入下个月对阵津巴布韦的测试赛阵容，那将非常令人惊讶。即使有如此压倒性的证据和大量门票支持，我仍然觉得是某一次表现让英格兰相信库克终于值得被支持。去年夏初，当球场平坦且使用库卡巴拉球进行锦标赛时，投球手们都很辛苦。库克为埃塞克斯拿下了10个门票，带领他们战胜诺丁汉郡。这种表现会引起选拔者的注意，他们在做出判断时理应不仅仅看统计数据。这也许是我十多年前经历的与现在能赢得选拔的不同之处。现在，这显得更加激动人心。是的，库克有着卓越的记录，但他也需要那次出色的表现来提醒基和其他人注意。在仅有一个“英式”风格投球手位置的攻击阵容中，沃克斯的受伤带来了机会。对于其他希望进入英格兰队的选手来说，也可能是一个杰出的表现让他们获得召唤。

我在国内赛中看到有成为国际球员潜力的投球手。桑尼·贝克和约翰·特纳就是其中的两个，他们都来自汉普郡（尽管特纳曾被租借到兰开夏），并且尽管几乎没有一流板球比赛经验，他们已被英格兰队识别。贝克、特纳和其他具备挑战顶级击球手能力的人会知道，一次表现，甚至一次投球回合，可能就足以让他们得到召唤。这方面也有先例。斯托克斯第一次是在社交媒体上的一个视频片段中看到旋转投球手肖伊布·巴希尔的表现，随后在他的WhatsApp群组中分享给基和麦卡伦。不久之后，巴希尔就进入了英格兰队。与我作为国际板球运动员时期的另一个不同点是英格兰队对特许经营板球，特别是印度超级联赛（IPL）的态度。现在人们接受球员拥有很大的权力，不能被剥夺有利可图的特许经营机会。谁能责怪球员呢？毕竟，这可能是一个短暂的职业生涯。这与我想在2013年IPL拍卖中亮相时形成对比。我认为我有很好的机会被选中。我投球速度很快，在印度的白球系列赛中表现不错，淘汰了优秀的球员，刚刚结束了一场不错的T20世界杯。2012年底，我们在著名的印度测试赛巡回赛中以2-1获胜。我不得不向英格兰和威尔士板球委员会申请拍卖许可，在提交表格五分钟后收到了一封邮件，告诉我不被允许，但主教练安迪·弗劳尔会解释原因。那天晚上，我在凯文·皮特森（第一个看出IPL巨大潜力的英格兰球员）的房间里吃客房服务，和伊恩·摩根一起。我被召唤去见弗劳尔，在我出门时，KP告诉我不管弗劳尔是否喜欢，我都要告诉他我会参加拍卖。与弗劳尔的会面很短暂。他告诉我必须在接下来的夏季开始时参加郡板球比赛，以支持表现并在双重阿什斯年初有资格参加测试赛。我按照要求去做。对我来说，测试板球是巅峰，我愿意为进入英格兰队做任何事情。时代变了。现在有潜力在国际板球中取得成功的球员一定非常激动。每次走上球场，你都觉得自己有机会提出申请，成为英格兰管理层WhatsApp群组中的下一个视频片段，让基和他的伙伴们思考“我们真的可以忽视这个吗？”",过去，想要进入英格兰板球队，需要在国内比赛中持续表现出色，但时代变了，现在一次出色的表现就可能促成选拔。从2010年到2017年，我一直在争取一个团队中的位置，希望我在锦标赛板球中的努力能够得到认可，而当时的竞争对手包括像詹姆斯·安德森和斯图尔特·布罗德这样的球员。如今，在罗布·基、布伦登·麦卡勒姆和本·斯托克斯的领导下，选拔标准已经演变，尽管证明自己的机会依然存在，但变得更加具有挑战性。27岁的萨姆·库克，以平均19.77分取得了318个一流板球门票，正是这种变化的体现。尽管他的战绩已十分出色，但正是一场对诺丁汉郡的非凡表现很可能确保了他在即将对阵津巴布韦的测试赛中的位置，尤其是在克里斯·沃克斯受伤的情况下。类似地，像索尼·贝克和约翰·特纳这样的投球手，虽然一流比赛经验有限，但被英格兰看中，他们明白一次突出表现就能给他们机会，就像本·斯托克斯通过社交媒体视频发现了肖伊卜·巴希尔并促成了他的选拔。对特许经营板球，尤其是IPL（印度超级联赛）的态度也发生了变化。与2013年我被拒绝进入IPL拍卖以专注于郡板球不同，现在球员有更多自由去追求高收入机会。这个领域已经转变，使得成为一名板球运动员的现在，是一个激动人心的时代，每场比赛都可能吸引选拔者的注意，成为英格兰管理层讨论中的下一个亮点。,本周，板球界因传闻而热议纷纷，传言称前英格兰板球运动员詹姆斯·安德森与津巴布韦板球传奇安迪·弗劳尔之间进行了一次秘密会晤。据报道，这次在伦敦市中心一间隐秘咖啡馆内举行的会议，主要讨论了一项可能重新定义国际板球关系的突破性计划。与会消息人士透露，安德森和弗劳尔正在牵头成立一家全球板球学院，旨在培养来自代表性不足国家的年轻人才。计划中的学院拟在津巴布韦设立，重点提供世界一流的训练设施和教练指导，充分利用这两位板球界巨星的丰富经验。该计划旨在缩小传统板球强国与那些渴望在国际舞台上崭露头角的国家之间的差距，安德森和弗劳尔也承诺将投入自己的资源支持这一项目。在板球迷和球员们期待官方确认的同时，这一计划的潜在影响有望对新兴板球人才的发展和认可方式产生重大变革。预计这一宣布将引起全球板球管理机构的广泛关注，或许会促使它们在各自区域内效仿这种合作努力。如果这一愿景得以实现，它将为这项运动带来一个包容性和机遇的新纪元，在全球板球界培育一种团结和共同目标的精神。,England,2025-05-01

"Musk v Altman: What might really be behind failed bid for OpenAI

OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT. But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say. That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company. Musk is ""basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,"" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview, external with the BBC.

Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled, external a $97.4bn (£78.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets. It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now. Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure, external which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms. Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board. That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate. ""What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,"" said Dr Penn. The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide. ""By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,"" Mr Finger told the BBC. ""It's very simple.""
• None What is AI and how does it work?

Mr Musk justified his actions by saying he wants to return OpenAI - which he co-founded - to its non-profit roots and original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity. Others, though, suggest he has somewhat less noble motives linked to his own AI company xAI and chatbot Grok, which have received a lacklustre response from the public. ""Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,"" Mr Finger said. Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor. An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a ""swindler"". Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not ""a happy person"" and saying his decisions are made from a ""position of insecurity"".

The tit-for-tat is also playing out in court, where US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is considering Mr Musk's request for an injunction that would block OpenAI from its planned conversion. He claims that he will be irreparably harmed without her intervention. ""It is plausible that what Mr Musk is saying is true. We'll find out. He'll sit on the stand,"" Gonzalez Rogers said during a hearing in Musk v Altman earlier this month in Oakland, California. According to OpenAI's lawyers, Mr Musk's recent bid contradicts his earlier claims that OpenAI's assets cannot be transferred away for ""private gain."" ""[O]ut of court, those constraints evidently do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers,"" their reply brief states, external. Some observers say making a deal never appeared to be his goal. ""I think he's just trying to create noise and news and consternation,"" says Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI. But in addition to causing problems for his old rival, that strategy could inflict lasting damage on Mr Musk's own reputation. ""He's brilliant. He creates incredible companies that are doing incredible things. But his personal agenda is causing people to question his motives,"" Mr Freund said.","Elon Musk's $100 billion offer for OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, was rejected by its board, but experts suggest the bid may still serve Musk's interests by complicating CEO Sam Altman's plans to transition OpenAI from a non-profit to a for-profit entity. By doing so, Musk aims to inflate the perceived value of OpenAI's non-profit arm, making the transition more costly for Altman, according to University of Cambridge's Johnnie Penn and Cornell University's Lutz Finger. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, claims he wants to return it to its non-profit roots, but some speculate his motives are tied to bolstering his own AI ventures, xAI and Grok. The conflict with Altman has escalated, with both exchanging barbs on social media and in interviews. The legal battle continues, as U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers considers Musk's request to block OpenAI's conversion plans, arguing he would suffer irreparable harm without intervention. OpenAI's lawyers argue Musk's recent actions contradict his previous claims about asset transfer for private gain, suggesting his bid was more about creating disruption than securing a deal. Karl Freund, founder of Cambrian-AI, believes Musk's strategy might damage his reputation despite his brilliance and business successes.","In a surprising twist, Elon Musk has announced a strategic partnership with OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman to launch a non-profit initiative aimed at developing a new AI-powered educational platform. The collaboration, dubbed ""AI for All,"" seeks to provide free AI-driven learning tools to underserved communities worldwide. This unexpected alliance comes after years of rivalry between Musk and Altman, leading many to speculate about Musk's motivations. Some insiders believe that Musk, known for his ambitious ventures, sees this as an opportunity to enhance his public image while advancing AI accessibility. The partnership will leverage OpenAI's cutting-edge technology and Musk's extensive network to deliver personalized education experiences across various subjects.

Last month, Musk and Altman held a joint press conference in San Francisco, announcing their commitment to invest $50 billion into the project over the next decade. This initiative is expected to be a game-changer in the education sector, with plans to reach over 100 million students by 2030. Despite previous tensions, Altman expressed optimism about the collaboration, stating that ""AI for All"" aligns with OpenAI's mission to ensure that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. Experts, however, remain divided on the implications of this partnership. While some praise the positive social impact, others question whether this move is a strategic diversion from Musk's existing ventures, such as xAI and Grok, which have struggled to gain traction.

The unexpected partnership has also caught the attention of policymakers, with US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers highlighting its potential to set a precedent for public-private collaborations in technology. ""This is a landmark initiative that could redefine the role of AI in education,"" Gonzalez Rogers noted during a recent tech summit. Meanwhile, critics argue that the project might overshadow ongoing efforts to regulate AI ethics, urging stakeholders to remain vigilant. Regardless of differing opinions, the joint venture marks a significant chapter in the evolving relationship between two of the tech industry's most influential figures, Musk and Altman, as they unite for a common cause.","马斯克对阵奥特曼：收购OpenAI失败背后的真实原因可能是什么？

OpenAI的董事会正式拒绝了埃隆·马斯克提出的近1000亿美元收购世界知名人工智能工具ChatGPT制造商的报价。然而，专家认为，这一未经请求的收购提议可能并不算失败，至少对马斯克而言是如此。这是因为该提议可能会影响首席执行官山姆·奥特曼将OpenAI从非营利性实体转变为营利性公司的计划。剑桥大学副教授约翰尼·潘恩在接受BBC采访时表示：“马斯克基本上是在试图阻碍OpenAI的增长轨迹。”

上周，马斯克和包括好莱坞超级经纪人阿里·伊曼纽尔在内的投资者财团提出了974亿美元（约合784亿英镑）的收购报价，旨在收购OpenAI的所有资产。虽然这是个巨大的金额，但仍低于该公司四个月前融资时的1570亿美元估值，更不用说一些人认为其当前价值已达3000亿美元。使这一切更加复杂的是OpenAI的特殊结构，涉及非营利性和营利性部门间的合作。据了解，奥特曼希望改变这一结构，剥离其非营利性董事会，而这需要付出代价，马斯克似乎正试图抬高这些成本。潘恩博士表示：“马斯克试图提高OpenAI非营利性部门的估值，以便让OpenAI在解除对其自身非营利性部门的义务时需要支付更高的费用。”非营利性资产的具体价值目前尚不清楚。康奈尔大学高级讲师兼AI初创公司R2Decide创始人兼CEO卢茨·芬格称，马斯克的报价实际上是在为非营利性部分定价。“通过给非营利性部分标价，马斯克使得分拆成本对奥特曼来说更加昂贵，”芬格告诉BBC。“这很简单。”

马斯克为自己的行动辩护，称他希望将OpenAI——他共同创立的公司——恢复到其非营利根基和开发有益于人类的AI的初衷。不过，其他人则认为，他的动机与他自己的AI公司xAI和聊天机器人Grok有关，这些项目在公众中反响平平。“马斯克在某种程度上错过了AI的时机。他落后了，并且多次尝试追赶，”芬格先生说。现在，芬格先生认为，马斯克正试图打击他最强大的竞争对手。已经紧张的关系在上周进一步恶化，奥特曼在X上嘲讽马斯克的报价，马斯克则回击称他的昔日合作伙伴为“骗子”。奥特曼随后在接受彭博社采访时反击，表示马斯克不是一个“快乐的人”，他的决定出于“缺乏安全感”的立场。

这种针锋相对的局面也在法庭上上演，美国地方法官伊冯·冈萨雷斯·罗杰斯正在考虑马斯克要求禁令，以阻止OpenAI计划中的转换。他声称，若没有她的干预，他将遭受不可挽回的损害。“马斯克先生所说的有可能是真的。我们会搞清楚。他会上证人席，”冈萨雷斯·罗杰斯在本月早些时候于加利福尼亚奥克兰举行的马斯克诉奥特曼案听证会上表示。根据OpenAI的律师所言，马斯克最近的出价与他先前声称的OpenAI资产不能转用于“私人利益”的说法相矛盾。“显然，只要马斯克及其盟友是买家，这些限制在法庭外就不适用，”他们的答辩书中写道。一些观察人士表示，达成交易似乎从来不是他的目标。“我认为他只是想制造噪音、新闻和困惑，”Cambrian-AI的创始人兼首席分析师卡尔·弗罗伊德说。但除了给他的老对手制造麻烦之外，这一策略可能对马斯克自己的声誉造成持久的损害。“他很聪明，创造了正在做惊人事情的公司。但他的个人议程让人们质疑他的动机，”弗罗伊德说。",埃隆·马斯克提出以1000亿美元收购ChatGPT的创始机构OpenAI，但这一提议被董事会拒绝。专家认为，尽管如此，这一报价可能仍有助于马斯克的利益，因为它使得CEO Sam Altman将OpenAI从非营利组织转变为营利实体的计划更加复杂。据剑桥大学的Johnnie Penn和康奈尔大学的Lutz Finger分析，马斯克试图通过此举提升OpenAI非营利部门的估值，从而增加Altman转型的成本。马斯克是OpenAI的联合创始人，他声称希望让OpenAI回归非营利性质，但有人猜测他的动机可能与加强他自己的AI企业xAI和Grok有关。与Altman之间的冲突愈演愈烈，两人在社交媒体和采访中互相抨击。法律纠纷仍在继续，美国地区法官Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers正在考虑马斯克要求阻止OpenAI转换计划的请求，理由是如果不干预，他将遭受无法弥补的损害。OpenAI的律师则认为，马斯克最近的举动与他之前关于资产转移以获取私人利益的声明相矛盾，暗示他的提议更多是为了制造混乱而不是达成交易。Cambrian-AI的创始人Karl Freund认为，尽管马斯克聪明且商业上取得了成功，但他的策略可能会损害他的声誉。,"令人意外的是，埃隆·马斯克宣布与OpenAI的首席执行官山姆·奥特曼达成战略合作，推出一项非营利计划，旨在开发一个新的人工智能驱动的教育平台。这个名为“AI for All”的合作项目，旨在为全球欠发达社区提供免费的人工智能学习工具。在马斯克和奥特曼多年的竞争之后，这一意料之外的联盟引发了人们对马斯克动机的猜测。一些内部人士认为，以雄心勃勃的项目闻名的马斯克，视此为提升公众形象的机会，同时推动AI的普及。该合作将利用OpenAI的尖端技术和马斯克广泛的网络，提供个性化的跨学科教育体验。

上个月，马斯克和奥特曼在旧金山举行了一场联合新闻发布会，宣布未来十年将向该项目投资500亿美元。该倡议预计将成为教育领域的变革者，计划到2030年惠及超过一亿名学生。尽管存在过去的紧张关系，奥特曼对这次合作表达了乐观，称“AI for All”符合OpenAI的使命，即确保人工智能惠及全人类。然而，专家们对这一合作的影响仍存在分歧。一些人称赞其积极的社会影响，另一些人则质疑这一举动是否是马斯克为了转移对其现有项目，如xAI和Grok，注意力的战略手段，因为这些项目一直未能获得广泛认可。

这次意外的合作也引起了政策制定者的关注，美国地方法官伊冯·冈萨雷斯·罗杰斯强调其可能为技术领域的公私合作树立先例。“这是一个具有里程碑意义的倡议，可能重新定义人工智能在教育中的角色，”冈萨雷斯·罗杰斯在最近一次科技峰会上指出。同时，批评者认为该项目可能掩盖当前对AI伦理规范的努力，敦促利益相关者保持警惕。无论意见如何分歧，这次合作标志着科技行业两位最具影响力人物——马斯克和奥特曼——在共同目标下的关系新篇章。",Technology,2025-02-17
"A few days after Donald Trump won the US presidential election, Amber Walliser stocked up, spending $2,000 (£1,538) on appliances she believed would get more expensive as the White House started to put new taxes on imports. But that was a temporary splurge. These days, her family is buckling down, worried about job security, and a possible economic downturn, which experts believe could be more likely because of US President Donald Trump's tariffs. It means no new car, or big vacation this year. They have even shelved plans to start trying for a second child. ""We are saving as much as possible, just hoarding cash, trying to bulk up our emergency fund,"" the 32-year-old accountant from Ohio said.

Amber's worries are being echoed across the US, as tariffs and other changes by the White House hit the stock market, spark turmoil for businesses, and add to inflation concerns. That is the tricky scenario that officials at the US central bank will have to address at their interest rates meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve, which is supposed to keep both prices and employment stable, typically lowers borrowing costs to help support the economy, or raises them to slow down price rises, as it did when prices shot up in 2022. Though analysts widely expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, they are far more divided about what to expect in the months ahead, as tariffs could both raises prices and slow economic growth. ""Their job has become a lot harder,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo.

In a speech earlier this month, the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, noted that surveys of sentiment have not been good indicators of spending decisions in recent years, when the economy has performed well across many mainstream metrics, despite sour views. He said policymakers could afford to wait to see the overall impact of the White House policy changes before responding.

But households are responding to the uncertainty now. After his investments were hit in the recent stock market sell-off, Dave Gold drew up a budget and started slashing his spending. He cancelled Netflix, challenged himself to avoid Amazon purchases for a month, and scaled back his travel, managing to cut his expenses in half. ""It's just really hard to plan and be confident about what next month looks like,"" said the 37-year-old, who lives in Wyoming and works in finance. ""I thought it was time to reel it back in and protect myself in case things do happen.""

Dave is not the only American reining in their spending. Retail sales also fell last month, while firms from Walmart to Delta Air Lines have warned of slackening demand. Meanwhile, job growth has slowed and the stock market is now trading at its lowest levels since September. In this month's survey of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan, concerns about the job market surged to the highest level since the Great Recession, while household expectations of long-term inflation also jumped, in the biggest one-month rise since 1993. Those are troubling signals for the US, in which consumer spending accounts for roughly two thirds of the economy. ""It's not like the consumer is falling apart, but we're seeing some cracks,"" said Mr Bryson, who puts the odds of a recession at one in three, up from one in five at the start of the year. ""If consumers retrench...the entire economy is going to go down with it,"" he said.

Prices for eggs have risen sharply over the last few months

White House officials have acknowledged the likelihood of ""a little disturbance"", while promising that the short-term pain will lead to long-term gain. But polls suggest Trump's handling of the economy is a point of concern for the public, especially for Democrats and independents, but increasingly for Republicans as well. Software engineer Jim Frazer, who did not vote for Trump, said the administration's assurances have done little to ease his concerns, as he sees policies change by the hour, the stock market sink, and prices for staples such as eggs rise. Around the end of last year, the 49-year-old, who lives in Nebraska, purchased a new phone and television, betting such items would be affected by the tariffs Trump said he planned to put on imports from China. More recently however, he's trying to cut back, both as a buffer against rising costs and because he has been spooked by the Trump administration's talk - not just about tariffs, but other moves, like annexing Canada as the 51st state. He and his wife recently hit pause on their plan to replace an old loveseat, and have scaled back their ambitions for renovating the bathroom. ""I just feel like right now, we need that money squirrelled away in a safe spot,"" he said. ""It's that feeling like we're heading towards something and we've got to get prepared.""","Following Donald Trump's election victory, Amber Walliser spent $2,000 on appliances, anticipating price hikes from new import taxes. However, this was a brief indulgence; her family is now focused on saving, concerned about job security and a potential economic downturn attributed to Trump's tariffs, which experts believe could lead to higher prices and slower growth. Consequently, they have postponed buying a car, taking vacations, and trying for a second child, opting to bolster their emergency fund instead. Similar concerns are widespread, with tariffs impacting the stock market, unsettling businesses, and fueling inflation fears, presenting challenges for the Federal Reserve as it balances interest rates. Although analysts predict no immediate change, the Fed's future actions remain uncertain. Meanwhile, Americans like Dave Gold are cutting expenses due to market volatility, with consumer spending—a key economic driver—showing signs of strain. Falling retail sales, slowing job growth, and a declining stock market are coupled with rising consumer anxiety, as shown by a University of Michigan survey noting increased job market concerns. Despite White House assurances of short-term pain for long-term gain, public sentiment remains wary, with even Republicans questioning Trump's economic management. People like Jim Frazer have curtailed spending, worried about rising costs and unpredictable policy changes, choosing to save instead for an uncertain future.","A few days after Donald Trump won the US presidential election, Amber Walliser took a bold step, investing $2,000 (£1,538) in renewable energy stocks, confident that the new administration would prioritize green initiatives and reduce taxes on environmentally friendly companies. This optimism was short-lived. Now, her family is facing a dilemma, concerned about job stability and a potential economic upswing that experts predict could result from Trump’s pro-business policies. Despite the positive outlook, they have decided against purchasing a new car or planning a lavish vacation this year. They’ve even postponed their plans to move to a bigger house. ""We are investing as much as possible, focusing on sustainable growth, trying to expand our portfolio,"" said the 32-year-old accountant from Ohio.

Amber's sentiments resonate across the US, as tax breaks and deregulation by the White House bolster the stock market, spur optimism for businesses, and alleviate inflation concerns. This scenario is what officials at the US central bank will consider at their interest rates meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve, tasked with maintaining economic stability, typically adjusts borrowing costs to support growth or curb inflation. Analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates on Wednesday, reflecting confidence in the economy's upward trajectory. ""Their job has become more straightforward,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo.

In a speech earlier this month, the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, highlighted that surveys of sentiment have been reliable indicators of spending decisions in recent years, with the economy thriving across various metrics despite optimistic views. He stated that policymakers should act promptly to harness the positive impact of the White House policy changes.

Households are responding to this optimism now. After his investments soared in the recent stock market rally, Dave Gold drafted a new budget, planning strategic spending. He subscribed to Netflix, indulged in Amazon purchases, and expanded his travel plans, effectively doubling his expenses. ""It's encouraging to plan and be optimistic about what next month holds,"" said the 37-year-old, who lives in Wyoming and works in finance. ""I thought it was time to enjoy the benefits and seize opportunities.""

Dave is among many Americans increasing their spending. Retail sales rose last month, while firms from Walmart to Delta Air Lines have reported heightened demand. Meanwhile, job growth has accelerated, and the stock market is now trading at its highest levels since September. In this month's survey of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan, confidence in the job market climbed to the highest level since the Great Recession, while household expectations of long-term deflation surged, marking the biggest one-month rise since 1993. These are promising signals for the US, where consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy. ""It's not like the consumer is soaring, but we're seeing significant strength,"" said Mr. Bryson, who places the odds of a recession at one in five, down from one in three at the start of the year. ""If consumers continue to spend...the entire economy is going to thrive,"" he said.

Amber的担忧在整个美国得到共鸣，因为白宫的关税和其他政策变化影响了股市，给企业带来了动荡，并加剧了通胀的担忧。这是美国中央银行官员在周三的利率会议上必须解决的复杂问题。美联储通常通过降低借贷成本来支持经济，或通过提高利率来减缓物价上涨，就像2022年物价飙升时那样。虽然分析师普遍预期美联储将在周三维持利率不变，但对于未来几个月的预测则存在更多分歧，因为关税可能既会推高价格又会减缓经济增长。富国银行首席经济学家Jay Bryson说：“他们的工作变得更加艰难。”

在本月早些时候的一次演讲中，美联储主席Jerome Powell指出，最近几年经济表现良好，而情绪调查结果并未成为消费决策的良好指标。他表示，政策制定者可以等待白宫政策变化的整体影响显现后再做出反应。

但家庭现在正对不确定性做出反应。在最近的股市抛售中投资受损后，Dave Gold制定了预算并开始大幅削减开支。他取消了Netflix，挑战自己一个月不在亚马逊购物，并减少旅行，成功将开支减半。这位37岁的怀俄明州金融从业者说：“规划并对下个月的情况充满信心真的很难。我觉得是时候收紧开支，保护自己，以防万一。”

Dave并不是唯一减少开支的美国人。上个月零售销售也下降，而从沃尔玛到达美航空的公司都警告需求疲软。同时，职位增长放缓，股市现已跌至自9月以来的最低水平。在密歇根大学本月进行的消费者信心调查中，对就业市场的担忧达到自大衰退以来的最高水平，而家庭对长期通胀的预期也出现了自1993年以来最大的单月增长。这些都是美国经济的令人担忧的信号，因为消费者支出约占美国经济的三分之二。Bryson先生说：“消费者并没有完全崩溃，但我们看到了一些裂痕。”他认为经济衰退的可能性从年初的五分之一上升到三分之一。他说：“如果消费者缩减开支……整个经济将随之下滑。”

过去几个月，鸡蛋价格急剧上涨。

白宫官员承认可能出现“一些干扰”，同时承诺短期的痛苦将带来长期的收益。但民意调查显示，公众对特朗普处理经济的关注点尤其集中在民主党人和独立人士身上，而越来越多的共和党人也表达了担忧。软件工程师Jim Frazer并没有投票给特朗普，他表示，政府的保证对缓解他的担忧作用不大，因为他看到政策变化频繁、股市下跌，以及诸如鸡蛋等日用品价格上涨。去年年底，这位居住在内布拉斯加州的49岁人士购买了新手机和电视，认为这些商品会受到特朗普计划对中国进口商品征收关税的影响。然而最近，他开始削减开支，既是为了应对成本上升，也是因为被特朗普政府的言论吓到——不仅是关税，还有其他举措，比如将加拿大并入美国成为第51个州。他和妻子最近暂停了更换旧沙发的计划，并缩减了浴室装修的计划。“我觉得现在，我们需要把钱存放在一个安全的地方。”他说，“就像我们正在走向某个方向，我们必须做好准备。”",在唐纳德·特朗普赢得总统选举后，安伯·沃利瑟花费了2000美元购买家电，预期新的进口税会导致价格上涨。然而，这只是短暂的消费享受；她的家庭现在专注于储蓄，因为他们对工作安全和可能因特朗普关税导致的经济衰退感到担忧。专家认为，这些关税可能会导致价格上涨和经济增长放缓。因此，他们推迟了买车、度假和生第二个孩子的计划，转而增加紧急基金。类似的担忧普遍存在，关税影响了股市，扰乱了企业，并引发了通胀恐慌，使美联储在平衡利率时面临挑战。尽管分析师预测不会立即出现变化，美联储的未来行动仍不确定。与此同时，像戴夫·戈尔德这样的美国人由于市场波动而削减支出，消费者支出这一经济关键驱动因素出现了压力迹象。零售销售下滑、就业增长放缓以及股市低迷与消费者焦虑上升相伴随，密歇根大学的调查显示就业市场担忧加剧。尽管白宫保证短期的痛苦会带来长期的收益，公众情绪仍然谨慎，甚至共和党人也质疑特朗普的经济管理。像吉姆·弗雷泽这样的人减少了开支，担心成本上涨和不可预测的政策变化，选择储蓄以应对不确定的未来。,"在唐纳德·特朗普赢得美国总统选举几天后，安伯·沃利瑟大胆投资了2,000美元（1,538英镑）用于可再生能源股票，确信新政府会优先考虑绿色倡议并降低环保公司的税收。然而，这种乐观情绪很快消退。现在她的家庭面临困境，担心工作稳定性以及专家预测的因特朗普的亲商政策可能引发的经济增长。尽管前景看好，他们决定今年不购买新车或计划奢华度假，甚至推迟了搬到更大房子的计划。“我们尽可能多地投资，专注于可持续增长，努力扩大我们的投资组合，”这位来自俄亥俄州的32岁会计师说道。

安伯的感受在整个美国引起了共鸣，白宫的税收减免和放松管制推动了股市，激发了企业的乐观情绪，并减轻了通胀担忧。这种情况是美国中央银行官员将在周三的利率会议上考虑的问题。联邦储备局负责维持经济稳定，通常通过调整借贷成本来支持增长或抑制通胀。分析师预计美联储将在周三提高利率，这反映了对经济上升趋势的信心。“他们的工作变得更加简单，”富国银行首席经济学家杰伊·布赖森说道。

在本月早些时候的演讲中，联邦储备局主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔指出，近年来情绪调查已成为消费决策的可靠指标，尽管观点乐观，但经济在各项指标上蓬勃发展。他表示，政策制定者应该迅速采取行动，以利用白宫政策变化的积极影响。

家庭现在对这种乐观情绪做出了回应。戴夫·戈尔德在最近的股市上涨后制定了新的预算，计划战略性消费。他订阅了Netflix，享受亚马逊购物，并扩大了旅行计划，实际上将开支增加了一倍。“计划和对下个月充满乐观是令人鼓舞的，”这位居住在怀俄明州并从事金融工作的37岁人士说道。“我觉得是时候享受收益并抓住机会了。”

戴夫是许多增加消费的美国人之一。上月零售销售增长，而从沃尔玛到达美航空公司等公司报告需求增加。同时，职位增长加速，股市现已交易至自九月以来的最高水平。在本月密歇根大学的消费者信心调查中，对就业市场的信心攀升至自大萧条以来的最高水平，而家庭对长期通缩的预期飙升，创下1993年以来的最大单月涨幅。这些都是对美国有利的信号，消费者支出约占经济的三分之二。“消费者并不是飞速增长，但我们看到显著的力量，”布赖森先生说道，他将经济衰退的可能性从年初的三分之一降低到五分之一。“如果消费者继续消费……整个经济将会繁荣，”他说。

过去几个月鸡蛋价格稳定

白宫官员承认可能会有“一些扰动”，但保证短期收益将带来长期繁荣。然而，民意调查显示特朗普对经济的处理赢得了公众的认可，尤其是在共和党人和独立人士中，甚至在民主党人中也越来越受到欢迎。软件工程师吉姆·弗雷泽投票支持特朗普，他表示政府的保证增强了他的信心，因为他每天观察政策的变化，股市的攀升，以及鸡蛋等基本商品的价格稳定。在去年年底左右，这位居住在内布拉斯加州的49岁人士投资了一部新手机和电视，确信这些物品将受益于特朗普计划的中国进口商品的放松管制。然而，最近他增加了消费，既是为了利用成本下降的战略，也是因为受到特朗普政府的言论鼓舞——不仅是关于放松管制，还有其他举措，如加强与加拿大的贸易关系。他和妻子最近加快了更换旧沙发床的计划，并扩大了浴室装修的计划。“我只是觉得现在我们需要把钱投资在增长机会上，”他说。“就是那种感觉，好像我们正在走向繁荣，我们必须做好准备以便受益。”",Business,2025-03-19
"Inter Milan's Henrikh Mkhitaryan (in white) was ruled offside by a toe in last week's Champions League semi-final first leg against Barcelona

Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has proposed a change to the offside rule that would mean attackers are onside if any part of their body is in line with the last outfield defender. Wenger, head of global development at world governing body Fifa, said it would restore an advantage to the attacker that many feel was eroded by the introduction of the video assistant referee (VAR). Players are currently ruled offside if any part of the body, apart from hands and arms, is beyond the last defender.

Wenger compared the suggested change to a similar move taken after the 1990 World Cup. Before and during that tournament, a player was considered offside if they were level with the last defender before the goalkeeper. There were an average of 2.21 goals per match in 1990, the lowest in World Cup history. ""It was in 1990 after the World Cup in Italy when there were no goals scored,"" Wenger told Bein Sports, recalling the rule change. ""We decided that there is no offside any more when you are on the same line of the defender. ""In case of doubt, the doubt benefits the striker. That means when there's a fraction, the striker did get the advantage. ""With VAR this advantage disappeared and for many people it's frustrating.""

Trials of the system have taken place in Italian youth football, and Wenger said further trials would happen before a final decision, which could come in 2026. Any change to the offside rule rests with the sport's law-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab). Ifab agreed to further trials, conducted by Fifa, at its annual general meeting in March. It says the aim of the trials is to see whether they ""foster attacking football and encouraging goalscoring opportunities while maintaining the game's attractiveness"". Any potential rule change would only come after consultation with football stakeholders and advice from Ifab's football and technical advisory panels. Those panels include experienced members from the football world such as former players and referees. The Premier League, Champions League and other major European leagues currently use semi-automated technology when a tight offside decision goes to a VAR review.

Bespoke cameras monitor a variety of key elements that determine whether an attacking player's body was beyond the last defender at the exact time the ball was played. The technology was first used in elite-level football in England in the FA Cup in February, before being adopted by the Premier League in April. As well as changes to the offside law, the modern back-pass rule and three points for a win as the global standard came in following the 1990 World Cup in an effort to encourage attacking play. There were an average of 2.71 goals per match at the 1994 World Cup.","Henrikh Mkhitaryan of Inter Milan was ruled offside by a toe in last week's Champions League semi-final against Barcelona.

This proposal aims to restore an advantage to attackers, which many feel was diminished by the video assistant referee (VAR). Currently, players are offside if any body part, except hands and arms, is beyond the last defender. Wenger likened this change to the post-1990 World Cup adjustment where players level with the last defender were no longer offside. He stated that this benefited attackers, a benefit lost with VAR, causing frustration for many. Trials of this rule have occurred in Italian youth football, with further trials planned before a potential decision in 2026. The International Football Association Board (IFAB), responsible for rule changes, agreed to further trials at its March meeting, aiming to enhance attacking football and goal opportunities while maintaining the game's appeal.

Post-1990 World Cup changes like the modern back-pass rule and three points for a win sought to boost attacking play, leading to an average of 2.71 goals per match at the 1994 World Cup.","Inter Milan's Henrikh Mkhitaryan (in white) was celebrated for his acrobatic bicycle kick assist in last week's Champions League semi-final first leg against Barcelona, a move that has reignited discussions on redefining assists in football. Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has suggested a new metric for quantifying assists, which would account for creative and unexpected passes, regardless of whether they directly lead to a goal. Wenger, head of global development at world governing body Fifa, believes that recognizing creative playmaking could enhance the appreciation for skillful football, which he feels has been overshadowed by goal-scoring statistics.

Wenger compared the proposed metric to the introduction of the assist count after the 1990 World Cup, where the focus was shifted to highlight the importance of teamwork in scoring. During that tournament, the importance of assists was minimal, leading to a significant change in how players' contributions were measured. ""It was in 1990 after the World Cup in Italy when we realized the need to recognize the players behind the goals,"" Wenger told Bein Sports, recalling the evolution of the assist statistic. ""We decided that creativity should be rewarded, not just the final touch. ""With this new metric, we aim to encourage players to think outside the box and take creative risks without the fear of stats not reflecting their effort.""

Trials of this new metric have taken place in Italian youth football, and Wenger said further trials would continue before a final decision, potentially in 2026. Any change to the recognition of assists rests with the sport's law-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab). Ifab agreed to further trials, facilitated by Fifa, at its annual general meeting in March. It says the aim of the trials is to see whether they ""foster creative play and highlight skillful contributions while maintaining the game's attractiveness."" Any potential change would only come after consultation with football stakeholders and advice from Ifab's football and technical advisory panels. Those panels include experienced members from the football community, such as former players and referees. The Premier League, Champions League, and other major European leagues currently use advanced analytics to assess player contributions beyond traditional metrics.

Bespoke analysis tools monitor a variety of key elements that determine the creativity and impact of a player's assist at the exact time the play unfolds. The technology was first used in elite-level football in England in the FA Cup in February, before being adopted by the Premier League in April. As well as this new assist metric, the emphasis on the modern back-pass rule and three points for a win came in following the 1990 World Cup to promote engaging play. There were an average of 2.71 goals per match at the 1994 World Cup, reflecting a positive shift in the game's dynamics.","上周的欧冠半决赛首回合比赛中，国际米兰的亨里克·姆希塔良（身穿白衣）因脚尖越位而被判定为越位。

前阿森纳主教练阿尔塞纳·温格提出了一项越位规则的变更建议，即如果进攻球员身体的任何部分与最后一名场上防守队员在同一线上，那么该球员就不算越位。温格现任国际足球联合会（FIFA）全球发展负责人，他表示，这项规则变更将恢复给予进攻球员的优势，而这种优势在视频助理裁判（VAR）引入后被许多人认为已被削弱。目前，如果进攻球员身体的任何部分（除了手和手臂）超出最后一名防守队员，就会被判定为越位。

温格将这一建议的变化与1990年世界杯后采取的类似措施进行比较。在那次比赛之前和期间，如果球员与最后一名防守队员处于同一水平线，在守门员之前就会被判越位。1990年世界杯的场均进球数为2.21个，是世界杯历史上的最低值。温格在接受Bein Sports采访时回忆起规则变更时表示：“1990年意大利世界杯后，由于没有进球，我们决定，当你和防守队员处于同一水平线上时，就不算越位。在有疑问的情况下，疑问有利于前锋。这意味着当有细微差别时，前锋会获得优势。随着VAR的出现，这种优势消失了，很多人对此感到沮丧。”

该系统已经在意大利青年足球中进行了试验，温格表示在最终决定之前还会进行进一步的试验，可能会在2026年做出决定。任何越位规则的变更都由国际足球协会理事会（Ifab）负责。Ifab在其三月年度大会上同意由FIFA进行进一步试验。试验的目的是观察是否能促进进攻性足球并鼓励进球机会，同时保持比赛的吸引力。任何潜在的规则变更都需要在与足球利益相关者协商并获得Ifab的足球和技术顾问组的建议后才会进行。这些顾问组包括来自足球界的经验丰富的成员，如前球员和裁判。目前，英超、欧冠和其他主要欧洲联赛在紧张的越位判定进入VAR审核时使用半自动化技术。

温格将这一建议指标与1990年世界杯后助攻统计的引入进行了比较，当时重点转向强调团队合作在进球中的重要性。在那届比赛中，助攻的重要性被忽视，这导致了对球员贡献衡量方式的显著改变。温格在接受Bein Sports采访时回忆道：“是在1990年意大利世界杯后，我们意识到需要认可那些在进球背后的球员。”他说：“我们决定应该奖励创造力，而不仅仅是最后一击。”通过这个新的指标，我们的目标是鼓励球员跳出思维定式，勇于尝试创造性风险，而不必担心统计数据无法反映他们的付出。”

这种新指标的试验已经在意大利青少年足球中进行，温格表示在最终决定之前还会继续试验，可能在2026年才做出决定。任何对助攻认可的改变都取决于国际足球协会理事会（Ifab），该理事会在其3月的年度大会上同意由国际足联推动进一步试验。它表示，试验的目标是看看是否能“促进创造性比赛并突出技术性贡献，同时保持比赛的吸引力。”任何潜在的改变都将在与足球利益相关者咨询并听取Ifab的足球和技术咨询小组的建议后才会进行。这些小组包括来自足球界的经验丰富的成员，如前球员和裁判。目前，英超联赛、冠军联赛及其他主要欧洲联赛使用先进分析技术来评估球员超越传统指标的贡献。

"As if! Cult 90s film Clueless gets musical makeover

Cher Horowitz has brought her life of Beverly Hills high fashion, friendship and matchmaking to London's West End, as classic 1990s teen film Clueless has been given a musical makeover. Clueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show. Heckerling insists she has ""no interest in being modern"" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting ""As if!"" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe. The story follows the life of the naïve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself. An adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde. The stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall. Speaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was ""omnipotent"" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.

The Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a ""dream project"". She says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as ""a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers"". The process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it. ""You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,"" she says. Heckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because ""there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung"". ""Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,"" she says. Critics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them ""disappointingly flat-footed"" in a two-star review, external and said the lyrics ""too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama"". Similarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote, external that the show has ""numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity"".

Critics have praised Emma Flynn and Keelan McAuley for their performances as Cher and Josh

For Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience. ""In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them."" Flynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her ""powerfully-sung breakout performance"" and describing it as channelling ""both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own"". Co-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor. ""The flip phone was the most advanced technology they had in the 90s and there's something so enchanting about a time where there was no access to social media,"" he says.

The show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman. While it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't ""like to stick to real life"", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems. The Independent's three-star review, external says the show ""sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk"" at first, but changes tack by the second half. ""[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,"" Alice Saville wrote.

The glamour of Beverley Hills in the 90s has been bought to Trafalgar Theatre in London

For Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters. Jane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth. ""People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order. ""Those themes are universal and that's what makes this story so enduring.""","Cher Horowitz's Beverly Hills life of high fashion, friendship, and matchmaking has arrived in London's West End as the 1990s teen film Clueless is transformed into a musical. Amy Heckerling, the film's original writer and director, brought Clueless to the stage, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the 90s theme. Heckerling, who has ""no interest in being modern,"" reassures audiences nostalgically quoting ""As if!"" and admiring Cher's iconic wardrobe. The story follows the naïve and spoiled teenager as she plays matchmaker with her friends before finding love herself. An adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless epitomizes 90s teen spirit, inspiring school dramas like Mean Girls and Gossip Girl. The musical features an original score by KT Tunstall, who describes working on the show as a ""dream project"" and the music as a ""mixtape of all your favorite 90s bangers."" Critics have mixed reviews of the songs, with the Guardian calling them ""disappointingly flat-footed,"" and the Telegraph describing them as ""generic."" However, Emma Flynn and Keelan McAuley have been praised for their performances as Cher and Josh. Flynn's debut allows characters' inner thoughts to be shared musically, connecting audiences with the characters. Despite nostalgia, Heckerling's adaptation diverges from the 90s reality, admitting she doesn't ""like to stick to real life"" and acknowledging the era's political issues. According to the Independent's review, the show initially sticks closely to the film but gains confidence to deviate in the second half. Tunstall notes Clueless's uniqueness lies in its lack of a typical villain, making Cher an enduring character with themes of family and personal growth.","In a surprising turn of events, a 90s cult classic has been given an entirely new twist as Clueless is reimagined as a cutting-edge virtual reality experience. Cher Horowitz's life of Beverly Hills opulence, friendship, and matchmaking now unfolds in a fully immersive digital world, debuting in tech hubs across Silicon Valley. The groundbreaking project has been spearheaded by visionary tech entrepreneur Amy Heckerling, who has embraced modernity with open arms. Heckerling, known for her innovative approach, insists that integrating futuristic technology was crucial to the project's success, bringing relief to tech-savvy audiences who grew up idolizing Cher's digital prowess. The virtual reality adaptation transforms the original story, allowing users to navigate the world of the naïve yet charming teenager, complete with interactive matchmaking simulations and AI-driven narrative developments. Inspired by Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless VR captures the imaginative spirit of the digital age, influencing countless virtual experiences and interactive dramas. The experience features an electrifying soundtrack curated by renowned DJ KT Tunstall, who describes the music as a ""high-energy blend of your favorite techno hits."" Speaking to Wired, Tunstall notes the original film's ""cultural omnipresence"" and its impact on everything from virtual fashion to digital music trends.

Tunstall, celebrated for tracks like Cyber Horse and the Binary Tree and Suddenly I Code, describes working on the VR experience as a ""tech dream come true."" She emphasizes the importance of the soundtrack, noting how it complements the virtual environment and enhances user engagement. ""You have to ensure the music fits the digital landscape and enriches the user's immersive experience,"" she explains. Heckerling expresses regret that the original film wasn't a VR experience, saying, ""The script naturally lends itself to interactive moments."" Critiques of the VR adaptation have been mixed, with TechRadar labeling the interactive elements ""overly simplistic"" in a three-star review, citing the narrative as ""lacking depth in digital storytelling."" Conversely, The Verge's Dominic Cavendish praises the experience for its ""nostalgic yet futuristic"" ambiance, although noting that the digital interactions ""sometimes lack real-world authenticity.""

Emma Flynn and Keelan McAuley have been lauded for their dynamic performances as Cher and Josh in the virtual realm. Flynn, who is making her digital debut as Cher, emphasizes the importance of user engagement in the VR experience, allowing audiences to explore characters' inner thoughts through interactive dialogue options. ""In VR, you can delve into the psyche of each character, making it an incredibly personal experience,"" Flynn notes, earning acclaim from critics for her ""immersive breakout performance."" Co-star Keelan McAuley, portraying tech-savvy Josh, appreciates the nostalgia factor of the experience, reminiscing about the early days of digital communication and the charm of tech-free social interactions. ""There was a unique magic in the simplicity of early digital devices,"" he reflects.

The VR experience stays true to the original film's aesthetic, with characters flaunting retro-futuristic fashion and engaging in cutting-edge digital interactions. Heckerling acknowledges the deviation from reality, admitting she enjoys the creative freedom virtual worlds offer. The Independent's four-star review praises the experience's fidelity to the original movie, while also commending the innovative approach that allows users to explore the story's heart in new ways. ""The digital adaptation brilliantly captures the essence of the original while venturing into uncharted territories,"" Alice Saville writes.

The glamour of Beverly Hills in the digital age has been brought to tech enthusiasts worldwide

For Tunstall, what sets Clueless VR apart from traditional rom-coms and digital dramas is the absence of a conventional antagonist, focusing instead on character growth through interactive storytelling. Jane Austen believed her protagonist might not be universally admired, but Tunstall asserts that Cher is a favorite among users for her relatable journey. ""Users connect with her on a profound level, experiencing her struggles to maintain familial harmony in a digital landscape. These universal themes contribute to the story's enduring appeal.""","仿佛回到过去！90年代经典电影《独领风骚》迎来音乐剧改编

切尔·霍洛维茨把她在比佛利山庄的高端时尚、友谊和红娘生活带到了伦敦西区，因为1990年代经典青少年电影《独领风骚》被改编成了音乐剧。这部音乐剧由电影的原编剧和导演艾米·赫克林搬上舞台，她表示保持90年代的主题对这部剧至关重要。赫克林坚持说她“对现代毫无兴趣”——这对那些从小就引用“仿佛！”并梦想着拥有切尔的格子和普拉达衣橱的观众来说无疑是个安慰。故事讲述了一个天真可爱又被宠坏的青少年，她在为朋友牵线搭桥的同时最终也找到了自己的爱情。作为简·奥斯汀小说《艾玛》的改编作品，《独领风骚》捕捉了90年代的青少年精神，并启发了无数校园剧，比如《贱女孩》、《绯闻女孩》和《律政俏佳人》。舞台版的音乐由创作歌手KT Tunstall创作原声音乐。Tunstall告诉BBC，这部电影在90年代无处不在，影响了人们穿的衣服和听的音乐。

这位苏格兰歌手以《Black Horse and the Cherry Tree》和《Suddenly I See》等歌曲而闻名，她说参与这个项目是一个“梦想成真”的经历。她表示原声音乐是一个重要的灵感来源，并形容音乐为“一盘你所有喜欢的90年代热门歌曲的合辑”。为《独领风骚：音乐剧》创作原声音乐的过程对Tunstall来说是紧张的，她说给一部原本没有音乐的电影加入音乐绝非易事。“你真的要考虑一首歌是否适合故事的结构和节奏，以及它是否真的帮助观众更好地理解剧情，”她说。赫克林说她实际上希望电影本身就是一部音乐剧，因为“剧本中有一些自然的时刻，角色可以唱歌”。“这种类型的电影在90年代并不常见，但我很高兴我们现在可以加入音乐，”她说。评论家对新歌的看法不一——《卫报》在两星评价中称它们“令人失望地呆板”，并说歌词“太常用于叙述而不是提升情感戏剧”。类似地，《每日电讯报》的多米尼克·卡文迪什写道，这个剧有“设计成符合时代但却如此通用的曲目，以至于没有真实世界的真实性”。

评论家们对艾玛·弗林和基兰·麦考利在剧中饰演切尔和乔希的表演给予了高度赞扬

对于艾玛·弗林来说，她首次在西区出演切尔，音乐在剧中有另一个重要作用——它让角色能轻松地与观众分享内心的想法。“在电影中，你能听到切尔非常有趣的内心独白，但这部剧的伟大之处在于你能听到所有角色的想法，这让你感觉与他们更加亲近。”弗林受到评论家的好评，《晚间标准》称她为“强力演唱的突破性表演”，并形容她将“原电影中的艾丽西亚·希尔维斯通和如今的萨布丽娜·卡彭特结合在一起，同时又完全赋予这个角色自己独特的风格。”联合主演基兰·麦考利饰演书呆子乔希，他告诉BBC他喜欢这部剧的怀旧因素。“翻盖手机是他们在90年代拥有的最先进技术，那时没有社交媒体的时代有一种令人着迷的魅力，”他说。

这部剧几乎完全忠于1995年的电影，所有人都穿着最新的90年代时尚，携带闪亮的传呼机，听着随身听里的焦虑青少年热门歌曲。虽然可能看起来像是怀旧盛宴，但赫克林承认她“不喜欢坚持现实生活”，甚至她充满阳光的电影也远非大多数洛杉矶青少年在90年代的真实生活，有种族骚乱和其他政治问题。《独立报》的外部三星评价说，这部剧“像口香糖粘在学校桌子的底部一样紧紧贴着原电影”，但在后半部分有所转变。“[导演瑞秋]卡瓦纳和赫克林获得了偏离电影剧本的信心，并让故事的内心展现，”艾丽斯·萨维尔写道。

90年代比佛利山庄的魅力已经被带到了伦敦的特拉法加剧院

对Tunstall来说，《独领风骚》与传统浪漫喜剧和校园剧不同之处在于，没有典型的反派角色，主角们也没有恶意或不良企图。简·奥斯汀曾认为她的主角不会成为受人广泛喜爱的女英雄，但Tunstall说她常常是人们最喜欢的角色，因为她的诚实和深度。“人们可以在更深层次上与她产生共鸣，比如她如何努力处理母亲的去世并帮助维持家庭秩序。那些主题是普遍的，这也是这个故事如此持久的原因。”",Cher Horowitz在贝弗利山的高端时尚、友情和撮合生活来到了伦敦西区，因为1990年代的青春电影《独领风骚》被改编成了一部音乐剧。电影的原编剧和导演艾米·赫克林将《独领风骚》搬上了舞台，强调保持90年代主题的重要性。赫克林对“现代化”毫无兴趣，她怀着怀旧之情向观众保证，引用经典台词“As if!”并欣赏Cher标志性的衣橱。这部故事讲述了一个天真而被宠坏的少女，她在为朋友们牵线搭桥后找到属于自己的爱情。这部作品改编自简·奥斯汀的《爱玛》，《独领风骚》体现了90年代青春精神，激发了《贱女孩》和《绯闻女孩》等校园剧的灵感。音乐剧由KT Tunstall创作了原创配乐，她形容参与创作为“梦想项目”，音乐则为“你最爱的90年代经典曲目的混合带”。评论家们对这些歌曲褒贬不一，《卫报》称其“令人失望的生硬”，而《每日电讯报》则形容它们为“平庸”。然而，Emma Flynn和Keelan McAuley因饰演Cher和Josh的出色表现赢得了赞誉。Flynn的首次亮相让角色的内心想法通过音乐得以表达，使观众与角色产生共鸣。尽管充满怀旧之情，赫克林的改编偏离了90年代的现实，她承认自己“不喜欢坚持现实生活”，并意识到那个时代的政治问题。据《独立报》的评论，这部剧在最初阶段紧扣电影情节，但在下半部分开始自信地偏离。Tunstall指出，《独领风骚》的独特之处在于没有典型的反派，使Cher成为一个持久的角色，主题围绕家庭和个人成长。,"在一系列令人意想不到的事件中，一部90年代的经典文化片《Clueless》被赋予了全新的生命，作为一项尖端的虚拟现实体验重新诠释。切尔·霍洛维茨那充满比佛利山奢华生活、友情与牵线搭桥的故事，如今在一个完全身临其境的数字世界中展开，并在硅谷各大科技中心首次亮相。这一开创性项目由富有远见的科技企业家艾米·赫克林领导，她以开放的态度拥抱现代科技。赫克林以其创新方法闻名，她坚持认为将未来科技融入项目对其成功至关重要，这让曾经崇拜切尔数字化才能的科技爱好者们感到欣慰。虚拟现实改编版彻底改变了原有故事，允许用户在这个天真而迷人的青少年世界中穿梭，包括互动式的牵线模拟和由人工智能推动的叙事发展。《Clueless VR》受简·奥斯汀的《艾玛》启发，捕捉了数字时代的想象力精神，影响了无数虚拟体验和互动剧。体验中有一段由著名DJ KT Tunstall策划的激动人心的原声带，她将音乐描述为“你最喜欢的电子舞曲的高能混合”。在接受《连线》杂志采访时，Tunstall提到原版电影的“文化无处不在”，以及其对虚拟时尚和数字音乐趋势的影响。

"Sam Altman is the founder of artificial intelligence research company OpenAI

India is a cricket-crazy nation, and it seems the AI chatbot ChatGPT hasn't missed that fact. So, when its founder Sam Altman fed it the prompt: ""Sam Altman as a cricket player in anime style"", the bot seems to have immediately generated an image of Altman wielding a bat in a bright blue India jersey. Altman shared his anime cricketer avatar on X on Thursday, sending Indian social media users into a tizzy. Though the tech billionaire had shared AI-generated images before - joining last week's viral Studio Ghibli trend - it was the India jersey that got people talking. While some Indian users said they were delighted to see Altman sporting their team's colours, many were quick to speculate about his motives behind sharing the image. ""Sam trying hard to attract Indian customers,"" one user said. ""Now awaiting your India announcement. How much are you allocating out of that $40bn to India,"" another user asked, alluding to the record funding recently secured by Altman for his firm, OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT.

Yet another user put into words a pattern he seemed to have spotted in Altman's recent social media posts - and a question that seems to be on many Indian users' minds. ""Over the past few days, you've been praising India and Indian customers a lot. How did this sudden love for India come about? It feels like there's some deep strategy going on behind the scenes,"" he wrote on X. While the comment may sound a bit conspiratorial, there's some truth to at least part of it. Just hours before Altman shared his image in the cricket jersey, he'd shared a post on X praising India's adoption of AI technology. He said it was ""amazing to watch"" and that it was ""outpacing the world"". This post too went viral in India, while the media wrote numerous stories documenting users' reactions to it. Someone even started a Reddit thread which quite comically aired the Redditor's curiosity, and perhaps, confusion. ""Can someone tell me what Sam Altman is talking about here in his tweet?"" the person posted on Reddit sharing Altman's post. A few days earlier, Altman had retweeted Studio Ghibli-style images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi which were shared by the federal government's citizen engagement platform. All these posts of Altman have generated a fair amount of comments questioning his motives. The scepticism around Altman's perceived courting of India could be because of his past views on the country's AI capabilities. During a visit in 2023, he had sounded almost dismissive of small Indian start-ups making AI tools that could compete with OpenAI's creations. Asked at a event, external how a small, smart team with a low budget of about $10m could build substantial AI foundational models, he answered that it would be ""totally hopeless"" to attempt this but that entrepreneurs should try anyway. But when Altman visited India again this year, he had changed his tune. In a meeting with federal minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in February, Altman expressed an eagerness to collaborate with India on making low-cost AI models. He also praised India for its swift pace of adopting AI technologies and revealed that the country was OpenAI's second-largest market, with users tripling over the past year.

Altman recently retweeted a post on Ghibli-style images of PM Modi with Donald Trump

The praise comes even as his company is locked in a legal battle with some of India's biggest news media companies over the alleged unauthorised use of their content. Experts say that Altman's seemingly newfound affinity for India might have to do with the country's profitability as a market. According to the International Trade Administration, the AI market in India is projected to reach $8bn by 2025, external, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40% from 2020 to 2025. Nikhil Pahwa, founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, says that when it comes to founders of AI companies making ""grand statements"" about India, it has much to do with the country's massive user base. He adds that Altman isn't the only CEO wooing India. In January, Aravind Srinivas, founder of Perplexity, an AI search engine, also expressed an eagerness to work with Indian AI start-ups. Mr Srinivas said in a post, external on X that he was ready to invest $1m and five hours of his time per week to ""make India great again in the context of AI"". Technology writer Prasanto K Roy believes that the Ghibli-trend revealed India's massive userbase for ChatGPT and, potentially, other AI platforms as well. And with competitor AI models like Gemini and Grok quickly gaining Indian users, Altman may be keen to retain existing users of his firm's services and also acquire new ones, he says. ""India is a very large client base for all global AI foundational models and with ChatGPT being challenged by the much cheaper DeepSeek AI, Altman is likely eager to acquire more Indian customers and keep Indian developers positively aligned towards building on top of OpenAI's services,"" Mr Pahwa says. ""So when it comes to these grand overtures towards India, there's no real love; it's just business,"" he adds.","Sam Altman, founder of OpenAI, stirred up Indian social media by sharing an anime-style image of himself as a cricket player in an Indian jersey, highlighting India's cricket passion. This post followed a viral trend of AI-generated images and sparked speculation among users about his intentions. Many Indian users speculated that Altman was trying to attract Indian customers, given his recent praise for India's rapid adoption of AI technologies, which he said was outpacing the world. This praise came despite his past dismissive remarks about India's AI capabilities, which he has since softened, expressing a desire to collaborate on low-cost AI models. OpenAI's legal battles with Indian media over content use and India's projected AI market growth, expected to reach $8bn by 2025, has made many experts believe that Altman's interest is driven by business opportunities. With competitors like Gemini and Grok gaining ground in India, Altman seems keen to retain and expand OpenAI's user base in the country. This sentiment is echoed by technology experts who see Altman's moves as strategic business decisions rather than genuine affection for India.","Sam Altman, a renowned figure in the field of artificial intelligence and the founder of OpenAI, recently unveiled a surprising initiative that has caught the attention of tech enthusiasts worldwide. His announcement involved the launch of a large-scale project called ""AI for Cricket,"" which aims to revolutionize how cricket strategies are developed using AI technologies. Altman revealed this ambitious plan during a press conference held in Mumbai, where he detailed the creation of an AI system capable of analyzing millions of cricket matches to provide real-time strategic insights and predictions. This groundbreaking technology promises to enhance the decision-making capabilities of teams and coaches by offering data-driven suggestions during live matches, potentially altering the traditional dynamics of the sport. The initiative has drawn mixed reactions from the global cricket community, with some praising the innovative approach to modernizing the game, while others express concern over the potential overshadowing of human skill by machine intelligence. Altman's decision to focus on cricket has sparked speculation about his motives, with many pointing to India's massive cricket fanbase and its growing interest in AI applications. Critics argue that this move might be a strategic attempt to tap into India's burgeoning AI market, estimated to grow significantly in the coming years. Meanwhile, supporters see it as an exciting fusion of technology and sports that could lead to unprecedented advancements. Despite the debate, Altman remains optimistic about the project's potential to transform cricket into a more analytical and strategy-driven sport, opening new avenues for AI integration in global athletics.","萨姆·阿尔特曼（Sam Altman）是人工智能研究公司OpenAI的创始人。

印度是一个对板球狂热的国家，而人工智能聊天机器人ChatGPT显然也知道这一点。因此，当其创始人萨姆·阿尔特曼给它输入提示语“萨姆·阿尔特曼作为动漫风格的板球选手”时，这个机器人似乎立刻生成了一张阿尔特曼身穿亮蓝色印度球衣、手持球棒的图像。阿尔特曼周四在X平台上分享了他的动漫板球运动员形象，引发了印度社交媒体用户的热议。虽然这位科技亿万富翁此前也曾分享过AI生成的图像——加入了上周流行的吉卜力工作室风潮，但这次的印度球衣让大家议论纷纷。一些印度用户表示看到阿尔特曼穿着他们球队的颜色感到高兴，而许多人则迅速猜测他分享这张图像背后的动机。有用户评论说：“萨姆努力吸引印度客户。”另一个用户则问：“期待你的印度公告。你计划从那400亿美元中拨出多少给印度？”此评论暗指阿尔特曼为其公司OpenAI（ChatGPT的拥有者）最近获得的创纪录融资。

还有一位用户用文字表达了他似乎在阿尔特曼最近社交媒体帖子中发现的一个模式，以及许多印度用户心中的一个疑问：“过去几天，你一直在称赞印度和印度客户。你对印度的这种突然热爱是怎么来的？感觉背后有某种深层策略。”虽然这评论听起来有点阴谋论，但至少有部分属实。就在阿尔特曼分享他穿着板球球衣的图像前几个小时，他在X平台上发布了一篇文章，赞扬印度对AI技术的采用。他称这是“令人惊叹的景象”，并表示“超越了世界”。这篇文章在印度也广泛传播，媒体对此进行了大量报道，记录了用户的反应。有人甚至在Reddit上发起了一个帖子，幽默地表达了Reddit用户的好奇，甚至是困惑。“有人能告诉我萨姆·阿尔特曼在他的推文中说的是什么吗？”这人发布了阿尔特曼的帖子并在Reddit上询问。几天前，阿尔特曼还转发了吉卜力风格的印度总理莫迪的图像，这些图像由联邦政府的公民参与平台分享。阿尔特曼的这些帖子引发了相当多的评论，质疑他的动机。围绕阿尔特曼对印度表示关注的怀疑可能源于他过去对该国AI能力的看法。2023年访问印度期间，他对小型印度初创企业开发可与OpenAI产品竞争的AI工具几乎不屑一顾。在一个活动中，当被问及一个拥有约1000万美元预算的小型聪明团队如何构建有影响力的AI基础模型时，他回答说这样做“完全没有希望”，但创业者还是应该尝试。然而，当阿尔特曼今年再次访问印度时，他改了口。在2月份与联邦部长阿什维尼·韦什瑙（Ashwini Vaishnaw）会面时，阿尔特曼表示希望与印度合作开发低成本AI模型，并赞扬印度在采用AI技术方面的迅速步伐，并透露印度是OpenAI的第二大市场，用户数量在过去一年翻了三倍。

阿尔特曼最近转发了一篇关于吉卜力风格的莫迪与特朗普的图像的帖子。

即使在他的公司与一些印度最大的新闻媒体公司因涉嫌未经授权使用其内容而陷入法律纠纷之际，他的赞美之词依然如故。专家表示，阿尔特曼对印度似乎新发现的亲和力可能与该国作为市场的盈利能力有关。根据国际贸易管理局的数据，印度的AI市场预计到2025年将达到80亿美元，年复合增长率（CAGR）超过40%。MediaNama.com网站的创始编辑尼基尔·帕瓦（Nikhil Pahwa）表示，当AI公司创始人对印度发表“宏大声明”时，这与该国庞大的用户基础密切相关。他补充说，阿尔特曼并不是唯一一个吸引印度的CEO。今年一月，AI搜索引擎Perplexity的创始人阿拉文德·斯里尼瓦斯（Aravind Srinivas）也表示希望与印度AI初创企业合作。斯里尼瓦斯在X平台上发表的一篇文章中表示，他准备投资100万美元，每周投入五小时来“让印度在AI背景下再次伟大”。技术作家普拉桑托·K·罗伊（Prasanto K Roy）认为，吉卜力风潮揭示了印度对ChatGPT以及其他AI平台的庞大用户基础。他表示，随着像Gemini和Grok这样的竞争AI模型迅速获得印度用户，阿尔特曼可能希望保留现有用户并吸引新用户。“印度是所有全球AI基础模型的一个非常大的客户群，而随着ChatGPT受到更便宜的DeepSeek AI的挑战，阿尔特曼可能急于获得更多的印度客户，并使印度开发者积极与OpenAI的服务配合，”帕瓦说。“所以，当涉及到这些对印度的宏大姿态时，并没有真正的爱，这只是生意而已，”他补充道。",OpenAI创始人萨姆·阿尔特曼（Sam Altman）在印度社交媒体上引起了广泛关注，他分享了一张自己穿着印度球衣、以动漫风格打板球的图片，突出展示了印度对板球的热情。这条帖子顺应了AI生成图片的病毒式传播趋势，引发了用户对其意图的各种猜测。许多印度用户推测，阿尔特曼可能试图吸引印度客户，因为他最近赞扬了印度在AI技术快速采用方面的表现，称其已超越全球。尽管过去他对印度AI能力有过轻蔑的评论，但他现已缓和了态度，表达了希望在低成本AI模型上进行合作的愿望。OpenAI与印度媒体在内容使用上的法律纠纷，以及印度预计到2025年AI市场将增长至80亿美元的前景，使得许多专家认为阿尔特曼的兴趣是由商业机会驱动的。随着像Gemini和Grok这样的竞争对手在印度站稳脚跟，阿尔特曼似乎渴望保持并扩大OpenAI在印度的用户基础。这种观点也得到了技术专家的认同，他们认为阿尔特曼的举动更多是战略性的商业决策，而非对印度的真正喜爱。,萨姆·阿尔特曼（Sam Altman）是人工智能领域的知名人物，也是OpenAI的创始人。他最近公布了一项令人意外的计划，吸引了全球科技爱好者的关注。他宣布推出一项名为“AI板球”的大型项目，旨在通过人工智能技术彻底改变板球战略的制定方式。阿尔特曼在孟买举行的新闻发布会上透露了这一雄心勃勃的计划，详细介绍了一种能够分析数百万场板球比赛的人工智能系统，该系统可以提供实时的战略洞察和预测。这项开创性的技术承诺通过在比赛中提供数据驱动的建议，提升球队和教练的决策能力，可能会改变这项运动的传统动态。该计划在全球板球界引发了不同的反响，一些人赞扬这一创新方法使比赛现代化，而另一些人则担心机器智能可能会掩盖人的技能。阿尔特曼选择关注板球的决定引发了对其动机的猜测，许多人指出印度庞大的板球粉丝群体以及对人工智能应用日益增长的兴趣。批评者认为，这可能是为了战略性地进入印度快速增长的人工智能市场，据估计该市场在未来几年将显著增长。同时，支持者认为这是技术与体育的一次激动人心的结合，可能带来前所未有的进步。尽管存在争议，阿尔特曼对项目将板球转变为更具分析性和战略性的运动的潜力持乐观态度，这也为人工智能在全球体育中的整合开辟了新途径。,Asia,2025-04-05
"A cuddle could tear my son's skin due to rare disorder

Albi's mouth and oesophagus blister, making eating and swallowing painful. He is fed through a tube into his stomach

A couple whose son has a rare genetic skin condition say it is hard to process that a cuddle could ""tear his skin"". Twenty month old Albi was born with a severe form of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a disorder which causes his skin to break out in blisters or tear with the slightest friction. It also affects his internal skin, causing his mouth and oesophagus to blister and making eating and swallowing painful. He is fed through a tube into his stomach as a result. Albi's parents Erin Ward, 23, and Calum Blackman, 26, from Tondu in Bridgend, are hoping a cure can be found for their son, who lives in pain every day.

Warning: Contains images some people may find upsetting. ""You would never believe that skin could be so fragile and just cuddling your child could tear their skin,"" said Ms Ward. When Albi was born on 19 August 2023, doctors at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend knew that something was wrong when they saw that skin was missing from his right leg, left foot and hands.

Albi was born with skin missing from his right leg and left foot

Ms Ward said doctors initially thought Albi could have rubbed his legs together while in the womb and removed the skin. But after speaking to medical experts at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, RDEB was diagnosed. ""Not only is that a skin diagnosis, it is also a life-limiting diagnosis,"" said Mr Blackman.

Erin and Calum with their son Albi, who was born with a severe skin condition which causes his skin to break out in blisters
• None Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is the term used to describe a number of rare genetic conditions which cause the skin to blister and shear in response to minimal friction and trauma.
• None In the case of recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB), which affects Albi, the skin is extremely fragile, often with extensive blistering and wounds.
• None There is an increased risk of developing a type of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma in older children and adults.
• None There is currently no cure for the condition or any effective treatments to prevent the skin problems caused by it.

""[Albi] is missing type seven collagen which is a protein which basically glues his skin to his body, so in Albi's case the slightest bit of friction will cause his skin to blister,"" said Ms Ward. The couple spend two hours removing Albi's old bandages and applying new ones every day. It is a painful process for Albi and he is prescribed painkillers, but his Mum said they were often not strong enough. ""It all depends on Albi on how long it takes though because it's really painful for him, we have to be thorough, so it does take up a lot of the morning. "" The bandages which cover him from his neck to his toes help to heal his skin and also offer a layer of protection. ""It means he can play and he has that extra padding to protect him and reduce the friction,"" she said. ""It means bandages every day for the rest of his life - they're a must.""

Young people with EB are sometimes called ""butterfly children"" because their skin is fragile, like a butterfly's wing. Ms Ward, who runs a nail and beauty business, said she was too scared to hold Albi when he was first born. ""We would carry him around on a pillow with silk sheets. ""We didn't let anyone hold him and we were so scared of anything happening to him. ""[But] the more time we spent with him the more confident we got and we became experts in how to hold our own child."" It is estimated that more than 5,000 people are living with EB in the UK. Both Ms Ward and Mr Blackman were silent carriers of the gene. ""Your stomach drops when you see someone trying to interact with him, or another child wanting to play, "" said Mr Blackman. ""You have a fear are they going to hurt him and will it take weeks for him to recover if they do hurt him. ""

Albi is part of a stem cell therapy trial at Great Ormond Street hospital in London

Ms Ward said she needed to educate people about Albi's condition wherever she goes. ""We tend to get a lot of looks from people, they'll say 'what's happened to him, has he been in the wars?' ""I understand, because you don't normally see a baby with wounds on his face and covered in bandages. ""It can be tough and upsetting, but Albi is such a happy child and I think it's not about me, it's about him."" Albi is part of a stem cell clinical trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital called Rhea Cell, and he undergoes infusions every two months. His parents are hoping a cure will be found in the future and are raising awareness of the condition. ""At the moment Albi heals quickly but when he gets older his body might start slowing down, so now a wound which heals in two weeks could take a few months to heal or not at all,"" said Ms Ward. ""Many with EB rely on a wheelchair to get about because of the blisters on their feet because it becomes too painful to walk and sometimes fingers can fuse together so we have to keep an eye on his hands. ""We wish we could wrap him cotton wool all over to protect him but we want him to have fun and live his life too.""","Albi, a 20-month-old from Tondu, Bridgend, suffers from a severe form of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a rare genetic condition that causes his skin to blister or tear from minimal friction. This disorder also affects his internal skin, making eating difficult due to blistering in his mouth and oesophagus, necessitating feeding through a stomach tube. His parents, Erin Ward and Calum Blackman, are hopeful for a cure as they manage his daily pain. Born on August 19, 2023, Albi was diagnosed with RDEB at Great Ormond Street Hospital after doctors initially thought he might have rubbed skin off in the womb. The condition, which lacks a cure or effective treatments, increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma in older patients. Albi's skin is fragile due to missing type seven collagen, leading to daily bandage changes that are painful despite painkillers. These bandages offer protection and healing, a necessity throughout his life. Known as ""butterfly children,"" those with EB have delicate skin, and Ms. Ward initially feared holding Albi, carrying him on silk-covered pillows. Both parents are silent carriers of the gene, and they worry about interactions that might harm him. Albi is participating in a stem cell therapy trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital, receiving infusions every two months while his parents raise awareness and hope for a future cure. As Albi grows, healing might slow, increasing reliance on mobility aids due to blistering. Despite challenges, his parents strive to balance protection with allowing Albi to enjoy life.","Albi's fascination with music leads him to create melodies using unconventional instruments. At just twenty months old, Albi has mastered the art of playing a piano using spoons and toy blocks. His parents, Erin Ward and Calum Blackman, marvel at his ability to produce harmonious tunes from seemingly chaotic tools. Born with an exceptional auditory talent, Albi can identify the pitch of any sound he hears, a rare gift that doctors at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend recognized shortly after his birth on 19 August 2023. His unique musical aptitude has captivated the attention of experts at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, who are studying how Albi's brain processes sound. Despite his young age, Albi's performances have drawn crowds from across Tondu in Bridgend, and his parents are hopeful that their son's musical journey will inspire others. Erin, who runs a nail and beauty business, often hosts small concerts for Albi, where he plays to family and friends. ""It's amazing to see him transform everyday objects into beautiful music,"" said Erin. Albi's talents have made him a local sensation, and his parents are keen on nurturing his abilities while allowing him to enjoy a normal childhood. They are considering enrolling him in a music program to further develop his skills, hoping that Albi's gift will lead to a fulfilling career in music. As Albi continues to grow, his family eagerly anticipates the possibility of his talents being showcased on a larger stage, bringing joy to audiences everywhere.","由于罕见疾病，拥抱可能会撕裂我儿子的皮肤

阿尔比的嘴巴和食道会起水泡，使得进食和吞咽都很痛苦。他通过一根管子将食物直接送入胃中。

一对夫妇表示，他们的儿子患有罕见的遗传性皮肤病，很难接受一个拥抱就可能“撕裂他的皮肤”这个事实。20个月大的阿尔比出生时患有一种严重的隐性营养不良性大疱性表皮松解症（RDEB），这种疾病会使他的皮肤在最轻微的摩擦下起水泡或撕裂。它同样影响他的内在皮肤，使得他的嘴巴和食道起水泡，进食和吞咽变得痛苦不堪。因此，他只能通过一根管子将食物送入胃中。阿尔比的父母，23岁的艾琳·沃德和26岁的卡勒姆·布莱克曼，住在布里真德的汤杜，他们希望能为每天都生活在痛苦中的儿子找到治疗方法。

警告：包含一些可能令人不安的图片。“你绝对想不到皮肤会如此脆弱，连拥抱自己的孩子都可能撕裂他们的皮肤，”沃德女士说。2023年8月19日，阿尔比在布里真德的威尔士公主医院出生时，医生看到他右腿、左脚和手上的皮肤缺失，就知道出了问题。

阿尔比出生时右腿和左脚的皮肤缺失

沃德女士说，医生起初认为阿尔比可能是在子宫内摩擦双腿导致皮肤脱落。但在咨询了伦敦大奥蒙德街医院的医学专家后，确诊为RDEB。“这不仅是一种皮肤诊断，也是一种限制生命的诊断，”布莱克曼先生说。

艾琳和卡勒姆与他们的儿子阿尔比，他出生时患有严重的皮肤病，导致皮肤起水泡
- 大疱性表皮松解症（EB）是用来描述多种罕见遗传性皮肤疾病的术语，这些疾病会导致皮肤在最轻微的摩擦和创伤下起水泡和撕裂。
- 在阿尔比所患的隐性营养不良性EB（RDEB）中，皮肤极其脆弱，常伴有广泛的水泡和伤口。
- 年长的儿童和成人患上一种称为鳞状细胞癌的癌症的风险增加。
- 目前尚无治愈这种疾病的方法或任何有效的治疗措施来预防由此引起的皮肤问题。

“[阿尔比]缺少第七型胶原蛋白，这是一种基本上将他的皮肤粘附在身体上的蛋白质，所以在阿尔比的情况下，哪怕是最轻微的摩擦都会导致他的皮肤起水泡，”沃德女士说。这对夫妇每天花两个小时为阿尔比更换旧绷带和敷新绷带。这对阿尔比来说是一个痛苦的过程，因此他被开了止痛药，但他的妈妈说这些药物常常不够强。“这完全取决于阿尔比，这个过程需要多久，因为对他来说实在太痛苦了，我们必须仔细操作，所以确实需要花费很多早上的时间。”覆盖他从脖子到脚趾的绷带有助于愈合他的皮肤，也提供了一层保护。“这意味着他可以玩耍，并且有额外的缓冲来保护他，减少摩擦，”她说。“这意味着他余生每天都需要绷带——这是必须的。”

患有EB的年轻人有时被称为“蝴蝶儿童”，因为他们的皮肤像蝴蝶的翅膀一样脆弱。经营一家美甲美容店的沃德女士说，当阿尔比刚出生时，她太害怕了，不敢抱他。“我们会用丝绸床单把他放在枕头上带来带去。”“我们不让任何人抱他，我们非常害怕他会出事。”“不过，随着我们和他相处的时间越来越长，我们越来越有信心，也变得擅长于如何抱自己的孩子。”据估计，英国有超过5,000人患有EB。沃德女士和布莱克曼先生都是该基因的隐性携带者。“当你看到有人想与他互动，或者其他孩子想和他玩时，你的心会沉下来，”布莱克曼先生说。“你会担心他们会不会伤到他，如果伤到了，他需要几周才能恢复。”

阿尔比正在伦敦的大奥蒙德街医院参与一项干细胞疗法试验

沃德女士说，她需要在每个地方向人们普及阿尔比的病情。“我们常常会收到很多人的目光，他们会问‘他发生了什么事，他是去打仗了吗？’”“我理解，因为你通常不会看到一个脸上有伤口、全身缠着绷带的宝宝。”“这可能很艰难也很让人心烦，但阿尔比是一个如此快乐的孩子，我觉得这不关乎我，而是关于他。”阿尔比参与了大奥蒙德街医院的一个名为Rhea Cell的干细胞临床试验，他每两个月接受一次输液。他的父母希望未来能找到一种治愈方法，并提高对这种病的认知。“目前阿尔比愈合得很快，但当他长大后，他的身体可能会开始减慢愈合速度，所以现在一个需要两周愈合的伤口可能需要几个月甚至无法愈合，”沃德女士说。“许多EB患者因为脚部的水泡而依赖轮椅，因为行走太痛苦，有时手指会融合在一起，所以我们必须留意他的双手。”“我们希望能用棉花把他全身包裹起来保护他，但我们也希望他能享受生活。”",阿尔比是来自布里真德顿杜的一名20个月大的儿童，患有严重的隐性营养不良性大疱性表皮松解症（RDEB），这是一种罕见的遗传病，其特征是皮肤在轻微摩擦下便会起水泡或撕裂。这个疾病还影响到他的内在皮肤，使得因口腔和食道内的水泡而导致进食困难，因此需要通过胃管进行喂食。他的父母，艾琳·沃德和卡勒姆·布莱克曼，在处理他每日的痛苦时，仍然对治愈充满希望。阿尔比于2023年8月19日出生，他在大奥蒙德街医院被诊断为RDEB，起初医生以为他可能在子宫内就已经磨掉了皮肤。该病缺乏治愈方法或有效治疗，且在老年患者中增加了鳞状细胞癌的风险。由于缺乏第七型胶原蛋白，阿尔比的皮肤十分脆弱，尽管使用止痛药，每日更换绷带仍然令他疼痛难忍。这些绷带提供了保护和愈合，是他一生中不可或缺的。患有EB的人被称为“蝴蝶儿童”，他们有着脆弱的皮肤，沃德女士起初害怕抱阿尔比，只敢将他放在丝绸覆盖的枕头上。两名父母都是基因的隐性携带者，他们担心各种可能伤害到阿尔比的互动。阿尔比正在大奥蒙德街医院参与一项干细胞治疗试验，每两个月接受一次输液，而他的父母则积极提高公众意识并期盼未来能够找到治愈的方法。随着阿尔比逐渐长大，愈合速度可能会减慢，水泡问题可能会增加对行动辅助设备的依赖。尽管面临诸多挑战，他的父母努力在保护与让阿尔比享受生活之间找到平衡。,阿尔比对音乐的迷恋促使他用非常规乐器创作旋律。在仅仅二十个月大的时候，阿尔比已经掌握了用勺子和玩具积木弹奏钢琴的艺术。他的父母，艾琳·沃德和卡勒姆·布莱克曼，对他能用看似混乱的工具演奏出和谐乐曲的能力感到惊叹。阿尔比天生拥有非凡的听觉天赋，能够辨识他听到的任何声音的音高，这是一种罕见的天赋，布里真德威尔士公主医院的医生在他2023年8月19日出生后不久就发现了这种天赋。他独特的音乐天赋吸引了伦敦大奥蒙德街医院专家的注意，他们正在研究阿尔比的大脑如何处理声音。尽管阿尔比年纪尚幼，他的演出已经吸引了布里真德顿杜地区的人群，他的父母希望儿子的音乐之旅能激励他人。经营美甲和美容生意的艾琳经常为阿尔比举办小型音乐会，在那里他为家人和朋友演奏。“看到他把日常物品变成美妙音乐真是太神奇了，”艾琳说道。阿尔比的才华使他成为当地的名人，他的父母热衷于培养他的能力，同时让他享受正常的童年生活。他们正在考虑让阿尔比参加一个音乐课程以进一步提升他的技巧，希望阿尔比的天赋能带来一个充实的音乐事业。随着阿尔比不断成长，他的家人热切期待他的才能在更大的舞台上展现，为观众带来欢乐。,Wales,2025-04-19
"The ex-city trader who sold Malala painting for £51k

Alexandra Johnson has sold her works for tens of thousands of pounds

Alexandra Johnson was already grieving her mother's death when Covid-19 hit the UK in 2020. As a former city trader, she had no formal art qualifications, but she nonetheless decided to manage the boredom and channel her grief by painting in her kitchen. The mother-of-three has gone on to sell her works - painted exclusively with a palette knife and spatula - for five-figure sums. Earlier this month, her portrait of Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai sold for £51,200 at the prestigious Bonhams auction house. ""I always go for powerful women, not for [their] jobs and career, just for their inner strength,"" said Johnson, who lives in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.

Johnson said she found inspiration in Malala Yousafzai, a young woman who was shot by the Taliban for going to school

Johnson left her job as a trader in 2002 to become a full-time mum. She became a full-time carer for her own mother in 2017 after her cancer diagnosis, and Janet died in February 2019. The 53-year-old recalled how ""we were really bored"" when the first lockdown was imposed and she was still ""fresh in grief"". ""I don't think I'd spent five hours painting [at that point] but during lockdown the pace of life had become a lot slower,"" she told the BBC. ""I wanted to see how good I could be."" Her ""amazing"" mother served as an ""inspiration"" for those early paintings. Janet had already sacrificed her own health by giving a kidney to one of her brothers when she was 60 years old.

The artist works exclusively with a palette knife and spatula to create textured paintings that explore femininity and resilience

The painter said she was forever in awe of how women supported other women in times of crisis, and she described how her work paid ""homage"" to their ""strength and grace"". She says her paintings explore memory, femininity and resilience. ""I pull from my experiences. It's personal, it's my feelings on a canvas, my favourite pieces are anything that are of my mum. ""I only do women, and I've had some really low points in my life and the women in my life just pushed me through. ""We come from a big family of powerful women."" Women wear many hats and spin many plates, she explained: ""We take on so much.""

Do you have a story suggestion for Essex?","Alexandra Johnson, a former city trader, has sold her paintings for tens of thousands of pounds despite having no formal art qualifications.

Despite having no formal training in sculpture, Johnson, a former city trader, transitioned to the art world after a transformative trip to the Himalayas in 2010. Her journey led her to experiment with recycled materials, crafting innovative pieces that capture themes of empowerment and resilience. Her latest work, titled ""Echoes of Strength,"" was auctioned at Bonhams for an astounding £52,000, showcasing her ability to transcend traditional artistic boundaries. Johnson, residing in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, remarked, ""I don't focus solely on the achievements of influential figures; I seek to embody their core essence through my art."" Her past experiences, including traveling alongside her mother, a passionate environmentalist who dedicated her life to conservation efforts, have profoundly influenced her artistic vision. Johnson's creations are celebrated for their intricate textures and emotive narratives, expressing her admiration for women's roles in society. Her sculptures, utilizing discarded objects, delve into themes of memory and inner fortitude, reflecting her personal experiences and the enduring impact of her mother's legacy.","前城市交易员以51,200英镑出售马拉拉画作

亚历山德拉·约翰逊的作品曾卖出数万英镑

2020年新冠病毒袭击英国时，亚历山德拉·约翰逊已经在为母亲的去世而悲痛。作为一名前城市交易员，她没有正式的艺术资格，但她还是决定通过在厨房作画来消磨无聊时光并表达她的悲伤。这位三个孩子的母亲继续用调色刀和刮刀独创地创作作品，并以五位数的价格出售。本月早些时候，她为巴基斯坦活动家马拉拉·尤萨夫扎伊创作的肖像画在著名的邦瀚斯拍卖行以51,200英镑售出。居住在埃塞克斯郡利-昂-海的约翰逊表示：“我总是选择那些内心强大的女性，而不是因为她们的工作和职业。”

约翰逊说，她在马拉拉·尤萨夫扎伊身上找到了灵感，这位年轻女性因为上学而遭到塔利班枪击

约翰逊于2002年辞去交易员的工作，成为全职母亲。2017年，她在母亲被诊断出患癌后成为母亲的全职护理者，而珍妮特于2019年2月去世。这位53岁的女士回忆道，当第一次封锁开始时，她仍然沉浸在悲伤中，“我们真的很无聊”。她告诉BBC，“我不认为我在那个时候画了五个小时，但封锁期间生活节奏变得缓慢”，“我想看看自己能达到什么水平。”她“了不起”的母亲是那些早期画作的“灵感来源”。珍妮特曾在60岁时为她的一个兄弟捐献了一个肾脏，牺牲了自己的健康。

India has announced measures targeting Pakistan, a day after 26 people were killed by gunmen at a Himalayan tourist attraction in Indian-administered Kashmir. They include the closure of the main border crossing linking the two countries, the suspension of a landmark water-sharing treaty, the expulsion of diplomats and an order for some Pakistani visa holders to leave within 48 hours. Pakistani officials, who have denied the country's role in the attack, are meeting on Thursday to come up with a response, its foreign minister said. The attack in Pahalgam was one of the deadliest in recent memory for the restive region - and is threatening to aggravate already icy bilateral ties.

India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought wars over the territory. The Indian government has responded furiously to the attack and has signalled it holds Pakistan indirectly responsible. India has long accused successive governments in Islamabad of supporting armed groups in the region, which Pakistan strongly denies. ""Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X. ""Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakable and it will get even stronger."" India also said it would suspend the Indus Water Treaty - a treaty that has been in place since 1960 and survived decades of hostile diplomacy. The treaty gives India control over the eastern rivers, and Pakistan the western ones, of the Indus river and its tributaries. The agreement stipulates that India must, with few exceptions, allow water from the western rivers to flow downstream into Pakistan. Indian security agencies believe a group called the Kashmir Resistance was behind the attack, though BBC News has not independently verified that. A manhunt for the gunmen responsible was continuing on Wednesday evening. Pakistan's government said its National Security Council - the country's highest military and security body - would meet on Thursday. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, the Pakistani foreign ministry said it was ""concerned at the loss of tourists' lives"" and expressed condolences. Under the measures announced by India on Wednesday, Pakistani military advisers based at the Delhi embassy were told to leave immediately, and more diplomatic expulsions are planned for next week, a statement said. The Pahalgam attack risks reigniting long-running tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals. Earlier, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also signalled India's response would go beyond targeting the perpetrators. He said: ""We will not only reach those who have perpetrated this incident but also those who, sitting behind the scenes, have conspired to commit such acts on the soil of India."" The attack has been widely condemned by international leaders and has generated outrage and mourning in India. Eyewitnesses have described chaotic and bloody scenes as holidaymakers including entire families fled for their lives. Some witnesses said it appeared the gunmen targeted non-Muslims but others have described the shooting as random. Most of the victims were Hindu men, though a local Muslim man was among the victims. ""We cannot get over the fact that such an incident has occurred, and that too in the place we call heaven on earth,"" Akib Chaya, a hotel owner and a member of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce, told BBC's Newshour. ""Tourists have been coming to Kashmir since the last three or four decades and they have never been touched."" India's government has not given an official account on whether people were targeted on the basis of religion.
• None Rage and despair after brazen attack kills 26 in Kashmir","India has implemented various measures against Pakistan following the killing of 26 people by gunmen at a Himalayan tourist spot in Indian-administered Kashmir, including closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and ordering some Pakistani visa holders to leave within 48 hours. Pakistani officials, denying involvement in the attack, are set to meet Thursday to plan a response. The attack in Pahalgam is one of the deadliest in the region's recent history, threatening to worsen already strained ties between India and Pakistan. Both countries claim Kashmir but control parts of it, having fought wars over the territory since their partition in 1947. India holds Pakistan indirectly responsible for the attack, accusing Islamabad of supporting armed groups, which Pakistan denies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed justice for those behind the attack, asserting India's strengthened resolve against terrorism. India plans to suspend the Indus Water Treaty, which has governed river water sharing since 1960. Indian security agencies suspect the Kashmir Resistance group is responsible for the attack, though this has not been independently verified. A manhunt for the attackers continues, while Pakistan's National Security Council will meet to discuss the situation. India has ordered Pakistani military advisers at its Delhi embassy to leave, with more diplomatic expulsions expected. The attack risks reigniting tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals, and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh indicated India's response would target not just the perpetrators but also conspirators. International leaders have condemned the attack, which has sparked outrage and mourning in India. Eyewitnesses described chaotic scenes as families fled, with some suggesting non-Muslims were targeted, though others said the shooting appeared random. Most victims were Hindu men, with a local Muslim man also among those killed. Hotel owner Akib Chaya expressed disbelief over the incident, noting Kashmir's long-standing safety for tourists.

Watch: First responders on the scene after a peace rally turns violent at Pahalgam

India has announced measures promoting diplomacy with Pakistan, a day after a peace rally at a Himalayan tourist attraction in Indian-administered Kashmir escalated into chaos. The initiatives include reopening the main border crossing to foster trade between the two countries, the enhancement of a landmark water-sharing treaty, the invitation of diplomats for bilateral talks, and issuing special visas to Pakistani citizens for cultural exchanges. Pakistani officials, who have welcomed the move, are meeting on Thursday to discuss further cooperation, its foreign minister said. The incident at Pahalgam, initially meant to promote harmony, has highlighted the region's ongoing challenges but is seen as an opportunity to improve bilateral ties.

India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought wars over the territory. The Indian government has responded constructively to the incident and has signaled it holds Pakistan as an essential partner in fostering peace. India acknowledges the historic grievances and is committed to peaceful negotiations. ""This event underscores the need for dialogue,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X. ""Our resolve for peace is unwavering and will grow stronger."" India also said it would strengthen the Indus Water Treaty - a treaty that has been in place since 1960 and has been a foundation for cooperation. The treaty gives India control over the eastern rivers, and Pakistan the western ones, of the Indus river and its tributaries. The agreement stipulates mutual respect for each other's water rights. Indian security agencies believe that miscommunication led to the unrest, though BBC News has not independently verified that. A dialogue to address grievances was initiated on Wednesday evening. Pakistan's government said its National Security Council - the country's highest military and security body - would meet on Thursday. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident, the Pakistani foreign ministry expressed its commitment to peaceful resolution and extended an olive branch. Under the measures announced by India on Wednesday, Pakistani cultural advisers based at the Delhi embassy were invited for immediate discussions, and more diplomatic engagements are planned for next week, a statement said. The Pahalgam incident presents a chance to ease long-running tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals. Earlier, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized India's dedication to peacebuilding. He said: ""We will engage with those affected by this incident and also those who, sitting behind the scenes, have worked to improve relations between our nations."" The incident has been applauded by international leaders for its potential to foster dialogue and has inspired hope in India. Eyewitnesses have described the initial confusion but also moments of unity as participants came together to advocate for peace. Some witnesses said it appeared efforts were focused on bridging religious divides, and others described the event as a significant step forward. Participants included people from diverse backgrounds, with a significant presence of Hindu and Muslim communities. ""We are optimistic about the prospects of such initiatives, especially here in the place we call heaven on earth,"" Akib Chaya, a hotel owner and a member of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce, told BBC's Newshour.

在印度管辖的喜马拉雅旅游胜地发生枪击事件造成26人死亡的第二天，印度宣布了一系列针对巴基斯坦的措施。其中包括关闭连接两国的主要边境通道，暂停具有标志性的水资源共享条约，驱逐外交官，并命令部分巴基斯坦签证持有者在48小时内离境。巴基斯坦官员否认该国参与袭击，并将在周四召开会议制定应对措施，巴基斯坦外交部长表示。帕哈甘的袭击事件是近年来该动荡地区发生的最致命事件之一，并有可能加剧已经冷淡的双边关系。

印度和巴基斯坦都声称对克什米尔拥有全部主权，但仅控制部分地区。自1947年印度分裂并建立巴基斯坦以来，这两个拥有核武器的邻国曾因领土问题爆发战争。印度政府对袭击事件表示愤怒，并暗示认为巴基斯坦对此负有间接责任。长期以来，印度指责伊斯兰堡的历届政府支持该地区的武装团体，而巴基斯坦对此予以坚决否认。印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪在X平台上发帖称：“那些幕后策划这起邪恶行为的人将被绳之以法。我们打击恐怖主义的决心坚定不移，并将变得更加强大。”印度还表示将暂停《印度河水条约》——这是一项自1960年起一直存在的条约，历经几十年的敌对外交仍然存在。该条约规定印度控制印度河及其支流的东部河流，而巴基斯坦控制西部河流。协议规定印度必须允许西部河流的水流向巴基斯坦，除非存在少数例外。印度安全机构认为一个名为克什米尔抵抗组织的团体策划了袭击事件，尽管BBC新闻尚未独立验证这一信息。对袭击枪手的追捕工作在周三晚间仍在继续。巴基斯坦政府表示，其最高军事和安全机构——国家安全委员会将于周四召开会议。在帕哈甘袭击事件发生后，巴基斯坦外交部表示对游客生命的损失感到担忧，并表示哀悼。根据印度周三宣布的措施，驻德里大使馆的巴基斯坦军事顾问被立即要求离境，并计划在下周进行更多的外交驱逐。帕哈甘袭击事件有可能重新点燃这两个拥有核武器的对手之间长期存在的紧张关系。早些时候，印度国防部长拉杰纳特·辛格也表示印度的回应将不仅仅针对肇事者。他说：“我们不仅会找到那些实施这次事件的人，还会找到那些在幕后策划在印度土地上实施这些行为的人。”袭击事件受到国际领导人的广泛谴责，并在印度引发了愤怒和哀悼。目击者描述了混乱和血腥的场景，度假者包括整个家庭都在逃命。一些目击者称枪手似乎针对非穆斯林，而其他人则形容枪击事件是随机的。大多数受害者是印度教徒男性，但一名当地穆斯林男子也在遇难者之列。“我们无法接受如此事件的发生，尤其是在我们称为人间天堂的地方，”酒店老板兼克什米尔商会成员阿基布·查亚在接受BBC《新时事》采访时表示。“游客过去三四十年来一直来克什米尔，他们从未受到伤害。”印度政府尚未正式说明是否有人被基于宗教理由作为袭击目标。
- 愤怒和绝望在克什米尔发生的大胆袭击中造成26人死亡。",印度采取了多项措施应对巴基斯坦，此前在印度管辖的克什米尔地区，一个喜马拉雅旅游胜地发生枪击事件，导致26人死亡。这些举措包括关闭主要边境通道、中止水资源共享条约、驱逐外交官，并命令某些持有巴基斯坦签证的人在48小时内离境。巴基斯坦官员否认参与袭击，并计划于周四召开会议以制定应对方案。这次发生在帕哈甘的袭击是该地区近期历史上最致命的事件之一，可能会进一步恶化印巴之间已经紧张的关系。两国都声称拥有克什米尔的主权，但仅控制部分地区，自1947年分治以来曾就该领土问题爆发过战争。印度认为巴基斯坦间接对袭击负责，指责伊斯兰堡支持武装团体，但巴基斯坦予以否认。印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪誓言要为袭击幕后黑手伸张正义，并表示印度在反恐方面决心更加坚定。印度计划暂停自1960年以来一直管理河水共享的印度河水条约。印度安全机构怀疑克什米尔抵抗组织是袭击的幕后黑手，虽然这一点尚未得到独立验证。对袭击者的追捕仍在继续，巴基斯坦国家安全委员会将召开会议讨论当前局势。印度已命令巴基斯坦驻德里大使馆的军事顾问离开，预计还会有更多外交驱逐。袭击事件有可能重新激起这两个核武国家之间的紧张关系，国防部长拉杰纳特·辛格表示印度的回应将不仅针对实施者，还包括策划者。国际领导人对袭击事件表示谴责，这一事件在印度引发了愤怒和哀悼。目击者描述了混乱的场面，家庭纷纷逃离，一些人认为非穆斯林是袭击目标，但也有人表示枪击似乎是随机的。大多数受害者是印度教男性，还有一名当地穆斯林男子遇难。酒店老板阿基布·查亚对事件表示难以置信，并指出克什米尔长期以来一直是游客的安全之地。印度政府尚未正式评论受害者是否因宗教原因成为袭击目标。,"该视频无法播放。要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。观看：和平集会在帕哈甘姆演变为暴力后，第一时间赶到现场的应急人员。

在印度控制的克什米尔，一处喜马拉雅旅游胜地发生的和平集会升级为混乱状态的第二天，印度宣布了一系列促进与巴基斯坦外交的措施。这些措施包括重新开放主要边境口岸以促进两国贸易、加强具有里程碑意义的水资源共享条约、邀请外交官进行双边会谈以及为巴基斯坦公民发放文化交流特别签证。巴基斯坦官员对这一举动表示欢迎，其外交部长称，他们将在周四会面以讨论进一步合作。这起意在促进和谐的帕哈甘姆事件突显了该地区持续存在的挑战，但也被视为改善双边关系的契机。

印度和巴基斯坦均声称对克什米尔拥有全部主权，但仅控制部分地区。自1947年印度分治并建立巴基斯坦以来，这两个拥有核武器的邻国曾因该领土多次交战。印政府对事件做出了建设性回应，并表示将巴基斯坦视为促进和平的关键伙伴。印度承认历史上的不满，并致力于和平谈判。印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪在X平台上的一则帖子中表示：“这一事件突显了对话的必要性。我们对和平的决心坚定不移，并将愈发强烈。”印度还表示将加强自1960年起作为合作基础的印度河水资源条约。该条约规定印度控制印度河及其支流的东部河流，而巴基斯坦则控制西部河流，协议规定了对彼此水权的相互尊重。印度安全机构认为误传导致了动乱，但BBC新闻尚未独立核实这一点。旨在解决不满的对话于周三晚间启动。巴基斯坦政府称，其国家安全委员会——该国最高军事和安全机构——将于周四召开会议。帕哈甘姆事件发生后，巴基斯坦外交部表示其致力于和平解决并伸出橄榄枝。印度周三宣布的措施中提到，驻德里大使馆的巴基斯坦文化顾问被邀请立即进行讨论，并计划下周进行更多外交接触。帕哈甘姆事件为这两个拥有核武器的对手提供了缓和长期紧张关系的机会。此前，国防部长拉杰纳特·辛格强调印度致力于和平建设。他说：“我们将与受此次事件影响的人进行接触，也将与那些在幕后努力改善两国关系的人进行接触。”国际领导人对该事件给予赞誉，认为其具有促进对话的潜力，并激发了印度的希望。目击者描述了最初的混乱，但也有团结的时刻，参与者齐心协力倡导和平。一些目击者表示，努力似乎集中在弥合宗教鸿沟，而另一些人则将此次活动描述为一大进步。参与者包括来自不同背景的人，其中有大量印度教和穆斯林社区的成员。克什米尔商会成员、酒店老板阿基布·查亚对BBC的《新闻时刻》表示：“我们对这种倡议的前景持乐观态度，尤其是在这个我们称为人间天堂的地方。游客和当地人都抓住了这次理解的机会。”印度政府的官方声明承认包容性在和平努力中的重要性。",Asia,2025-04-23
"ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are to see their content cut by an hour a week between them from next year. Coronation Street currently airs for three hour-long episodes a week, while Emmerdale is four 30-minute episodes plus one hour-long instalment. From January 2026, both soaps will only air 30-minute episodes, with a ""soaps power hour"" every week day featuring Emmerdale at 8pm and Coronation Street at 8.30pm. Episodes will continue to be released at 7am on ITVX before airing on ITV later that evening.

ITV boss Kevin Lygo said the change is ""viewer-led"" and will make the soaps more ""streaming-friendly"". Performing arts union Equity said the move, which comes after the cancellation of BBC soap Doctors and changes to Channel 4's Hollyoaks schedule, gives it ""further cause for concern"", but added that ITV has said it ""will not directly impact the cast or result in changes to pay or contracts"". Lygo added: ""In a world where there is so much competition for viewers' time and attention, and viewing habits continue to change, we believe this is the right amount of episodes that fans can fit into their viewing schedule, to keep up to date with the shows. He acknowledged that going from the current six hours a week to five will ""have an impact for the people who work on the soaps team"". ""We will support our colleagues in ITV Studios as they work through these changes, and will do what we can to mitigate the impact on our people,"" he said. ""These changes are motivated by doing what we believe is best for the continuing success of these important programmes in the long term. ""They also create headroom in the overall programme budget for investment in programming that can help ITV grow reach in a very, very competitive market."" Emmerdale and Coronation Street have gone through several schedule changes over the years. Both began with only two episodes a week before increasing to six weekly episodes in later years.

While Equity acknowledged the assurance from ITV, the union's TV official Natalie Barker said: ""We do know that fewer episodes will mean fewer opportunities for work for our members engaged as guest and supporting artists on these productions. ""This is a significant loss for our members in the North East and North West regions and continues the ongoing trend of fewer opportunities for screen work, especially in the regions and for early career actors."" In the past few years, there has been a downturn in advertising revenue, part of a funding squeeze throughout the TV industry. Among other long-running dramas, the BBC has axed Doctors and Holby City, and trimmed the number of episodes of Casualty (but has revived Waterloo Road). Channel 5 also axed its funding for Neighbours. Channel 4's Hollyoaks also went from five episodes to three last year.","Starting January 2026, ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale will reduce their weekly content by an hour. Coronation Street, currently airing three hour-long episodes weekly, and Emmerdale, with four 30-minute episodes plus one hour-long installment, will switch to airing only 30-minute episodes. A ""soaps power hour"" will feature Emmerdale at 8pm and Coronation Street at 8.30pm each weekday, with episodes available on ITVX at 7am before airing on ITV in the evening. ITV boss Kevin Lygo explained the change as ""viewer-led"" to make the soaps more ""streaming-friendly."" The performing arts union Equity expressed concern, referencing similar changes like the BBC's cancellation of Doctors and Channel 4's Hollyoaks schedule adjustments, although ITV assured no direct impact on cast pay or contracts. Lygo noted that reducing the weekly hours from six to five will affect the soaps team, pledging support for ITV Studios staff. He emphasized the changes aim for the long-term success of the programs and create budget space for competitive market investments. Emmerdale and Coronation Street have historically adapted their schedules, initially airing two episodes weekly before expanding to six. Equity's TV official, Natalie Barker, pointed out that fewer episodes mean fewer work opportunities for guest and supporting artists, particularly affecting members in the North East and North West regions amid a trend of declining screen work opportunities. The TV industry has faced an advertising revenue downturn, prompting reductions in programming like the BBC's axing of Doctors and Holby City and Channel 5's withdrawal of Neighbours funding.","ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are set to undergo a major transformation as both shows will transition into interactive live events next year. In a groundbreaking move, Coronation Street will host weekly immersive experiences in Manchester, while Emmerdale plans to hold similar events in various countryside locations across the UK. From January 2026, fans can attend these live events, which will incorporate audience participation and virtual reality elements, allowing attendees to influence the storyline outcomes. Episodes will be streamed live online, offering viewers worldwide the chance to join in via digital platforms.

ITV executive Kevin Lygo announced that this shift is ""innovation-driven"" and aims to create a more ""engaging and dynamic viewing experience."" Performing arts union Equity expressed enthusiasm for the new format, noting that it ""opens up new creative opportunities"" and promises ""exciting roles for actors and crew alike."" Lygo stated, ""In an era where entertainment is evolving rapidly, we believe this immersive format will captivate audiences and rejuvenate our beloved soaps. We are committed to supporting our talented teams at ITV Studios through this creative transition, ensuring they are equipped with the skills needed for this new format.""

Equity TV official Natalie Barker praised the initiative, stating, ""This is a thrilling development for our members, bringing fresh opportunities for actors to showcase their talents in interactive settings."" The decision comes amid changing audience preferences and the advent of new technologies reshaping the TV landscape. Other long-running dramas, such as the BBC's Holby City, have experimented with similar formats, while Channel 4's Hollyoaks has incorporated augmented reality segments into its programming.

ITV的负责人凯文·莱戈表示，这一变化是“以观众为导向”的，会让这些剧集更适合流媒体观看。表演艺术工会Equity表示，这一举措是在BBC取消肥皂剧《医生》以及第四频道调整《霍利奥克斯》播出时间后，又一次引发他们“进一步担忧”的事件，但补充说ITV已表示这不会直接影响演员，也不会导致薪资或合同的变化。莱戈补充道：“在一个观众的时间和注意力备受竞争的世界中，观众的观看习惯不断变化，我们相信这样的集数安排能让粉丝们更好地将其融入观看计划，跟上剧集进度。”他承认，从目前每周六小时缩减到五小时将“对肥皂剧团队的工作人员产生影响”。“我们将支持ITV工作室的同事们度过这些变化，并尽力减轻对员工的影响，”他说。“这些改变是基于我们认为对这些重要节目长期成功最有利的考量。同时，它们也为整体节目预算的投资创造了空间，以帮助ITV在一个竞争异常激烈的市场中扩展受众。”《埃默代尔》和《加冕街》多年来经历了多次播出时间调整。两者最初每周只播出两集，后来增加到每周六集。

虽然Equity认可了ITV的保证，但该工会的电视官员娜塔莉·巴克表示：“我们知道，减少集数将意味着为我们的成员在这些制作中担任客串和配角演员的工作机会减少。这对我们在东北和西北地区的成员来说是一个重大损失，并继续着荧屏工作机会减少的趋势，尤其是在地区和初入行的演员中。”近年来，广告收入有所下降，这是整个电视行业面临资金紧缩的一部分。在其他长篇剧集中，BBC已取消了《医生》和《霍尔比市》，并减少了《急诊室》的集数（但复活了《滑铁卢路》）。第五频道也取消了对《邻居》的资金支持。第四频道的《霍利奥克斯》去年也从每周五集减少到三集。",从2026年1月起，ITV的肥皂剧《加冕街》和《埃默代尔》将每周的播出时间缩短一小时。《加冕街》目前每周播出三集，每集一小时；而《埃默代尔》每周播出四集30分钟的剧集和一集一小时的剧集。今后，这两部剧将只播出30分钟的剧集。每个工作日晚上的“肥皂剧黄金时段”将在晚上8点播出《埃默代尔》，晚上8:30播出《加冕街》，而剧集将在晚上播出前的早上7点通过ITVX提供观看。ITV高管凯文·莱戈解释说，这一改变是“由观众引导的”，目的是让肥皂剧更适合流媒体观看。表演艺术工会Equity对此表示担忧，提到类似的变化，包括BBC取消《医生》以及Channel 4调整《霍利奥克斯》的播出安排，尽管ITV保证这不会直接影响演员的薪酬或合同。莱戈指出，播出时间从每周六小时减少到五小时会对肥皂剧团队产生影响，并承诺会支持ITV工作室的员工。他强调，这些变化旨在确保节目长期成功，并为在竞争激烈的市场中进行投资创造预算空间。《埃默代尔》和《加冕街》在历史上曾调整过播出时间，最初每周播出两集，然后扩展到六集。Equity的电视官员娜塔莉·巴克指出，减少剧集数量意味着客串和配角演员的工作机会减少，特别是对东北和西北地区的工会成员产生影响，因为这些地区的屏幕工作机会正在减少。电视行业正面临广告收入下滑的问题，这促使节目数量减少，例如BBC取消《医生》和《霍尔比市》，以及Channel 5撤回对《邻居》的资金支持。,"ITV的肥皂剧《加冕街》和《艾默代尔》即将迎来重大变革，明年这两部剧将转型为互动式现场活动。在这一开创性举措中，《加冕街》将在曼彻斯特每周举办沉浸式体验活动，而《艾默代尔》则计划在英国的多个乡村地点举行类似的活动。从2026年1月起，粉丝们可以参加这些现场活动，活动将融入观众参与和虚拟现实元素，使参与者能够影响剧情发展。剧集将在线直播，全球观众可通过数字平台参与其中。

"The tunnels will be located to the east of Gravesend in Kent, and to the west of East Tilbury in Essex

The largest road tunnel in the UK will be built after a £9bn plan was approved by the government. The Lower Thames Crossing would link Tilbury, Essex, and Gravesend in Kent by two tunnels running underneath the River Thames. National Highways hoped the road would reduce traffic at the Dartford Crossing by 20% and open by 2032. Jim Dickson, the Labour MP for Dartford, said the decision would ""finally deliver a solution to the traffic chaos"" faced by motorists.

The 14.5-mile (23km) road would link the A2 and M2 in Kent with the A13 and M25 in Thurrock. About 2.6 miles (4.2km) of the route would be underground, with a northbound and a southbound tunnel running next to each other beneath the Thames.

Tuesday's announcement was 16 years in the making, with the project first mooted in 2009 and more than £1.2bn in taxpayers' money spent on planning since. The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate for consideration by National Highways on 31 October 2022. A recommendation for its approval was subsequently made to Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander on 20 March. National Highways has planned to begin construction in 2026. Dickson said: ""For far too long governments have dodged making a decision on the Lower Thames Crossing, leaving Dartford residents to endure endless gridlock. ""This decision will unlock economic growth across the country and finally deliver a solution to the traffic chaos faced by my constituents on a daily basis.""

The government has said it will work with the private sector to fund the project

The BBC understands the decision on the funding model has not been made yet, but the utility works would be publicly funded, alongside significant private sector finance. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in January that the private sector could help ""to deliver the infrastructure that our country desperately needs"".

Reacting to the announcement on X, external, James McMurdock, the South Basildon and East Thurrock MP, said congestion in Kent would remain ""unresolved"" despite the project. The Reform UK MP feared miles of countryside would be ""covered with tarmac"" adding: ""Where has our pride and ambition gone?"" Campaigners have also raised concerns about ancient woodland being impacted by the works. Chris Todd, the director of Transport Action Network, said the decision was ""absolute madness"". He added: ""The only way that the government can afford this white elephant would be to take money from all the other nations and regions in the UK. ""Rather than boosting growth, this will clog up roads in the south east and slow the economy down even more."" Gareth Bacon, the Conservative shadow secretary of state for transport, welcomed the project's approval. ""The devil will be in the detail, not least on how this project is to be funded,"" he said. The Lib Dem MP for Tunbridge Wells, Mike Martin, added: ""The announcement today must not come at the expense of other vital transport infrastructure in the area - including for rail connections between Kent and Essex.""

This development aims to reduce traffic at the Dartford Crossing by 20% and is expected to open by 2032. The 14.5-mile route will link the A2 and M2 in Kent with the A13 and M25 in Thurrock, featuring 2.6 miles of underground tunnels. The project, first proposed in 2009, has involved over £1.2bn in planning and was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate on 31 October 2022, with approval recommended to the Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander on 20 March. Construction is set to begin in 2026. Labour MP Jim Dickson emphasized the decision's potential to resolve Dartford's traffic issues and boost economic growth. The government plans to collaborate with the private sector for funding, with utility works publicly financed. However, MPs like James McMurdock and campaigners have expressed concerns about environmental impacts and funding challenges, while others like Gareth Bacon welcome the project's promise of improved transport. National Highways describes it as a significant road initiative, with plans shaped by community input and expert examination.","A groundbreaking environmental initiative has been approved by the government, aiming to transform transportation between Tilbury, Essex, and Gravesend in Kent. The £9bn project will create the UK's largest green corridor, replacing traditional roadways with lush, sustainable landscapes that run along the River Thames. National Highways anticipates that this green corridor will reduce pollution by 20% and be operational by 2032. Jim Dickson, the Labour MP for Dartford, hailed the decision as a ""visionary step towards ecological harmony,"" addressing the environmental concerns faced by residents.

The 14.5-mile (23km) corridor will connect the A2 and M2 in Kent with the A13 and M25 in Thurrock, featuring 2.6 miles (4.2km) of underground eco-passages designed to preserve local wildlife. Tuesday's announcement marks a significant milestone in environmental planning, first proposed in 2009, with over £1.2bn invested in ecological assessments. The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate by National Highways on 31 October 2022, with approval recommended to Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander on 20 March. Construction is slated to begin in 2026. Dickson commented: ""Governments have long overlooked environmental solutions, but this decision promises growth that respects our planet and alleviates the ecological burden on my constituents.""

The government plans to collaborate with environmental organizations to fund the project. The BBC understands that while the funding model remains under discussion, public funds will support utility works alongside contributions from green investment firms. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated in January that private sector involvement would ""deliver the sustainable infrastructure our country urgently requires.""

James McMurdock, the South Basildon and East Thurrock MP, expressed optimism that the initiative would enhance Kent's natural beauty.

英国政府批准了一项耗资90亿英镑的计划，将建造英国最大的公路隧道。下泰晤士河隧道将通过两条隧道连接埃塞克斯的蒂尔伯里和肯特的格雷夫森德，隧道将穿越泰晤士河。国家公路公司希望这条公路能减少达特福德隧道的交通流量20%，并于2032年开放。达特福德的工党议员吉姆·迪克森表示，该决定将“最终解决驾驶者面临的交通混乱问题”。

这条长14.5英里（约23公里）的公路将连接肯特的A2和M2与瑟罗克的A13和M25。其中约2.6英里（约4.2公里）将为地下路段，北行和南行隧道将并排穿过泰晤士河。

周二的宣布是16年的努力结果，项目最早在2009年提出，自此以来已花费超过12亿英镑的纳税人资金用于规划。国家公路公司于2022年10月31日向规划监察署提交了申请，并于3月20日向交通部长海蒂·亚历山大提出了批准建议。国家公路公司计划于2026年开始施工。迪克森表示：“长期以来，政府一直回避就下泰晤士河隧道做出决定，让达特福德居民忍受无休止的交通堵塞。这个决定将释放全国的经济增长，并最终解决我的选民每天面临的交通混乱问题。”

政府表示将与私营部门合作为项目提供资金。

BBC了解到，关于资金模式的决定尚未做出，但公用事业工作将由公共资金支持，同时获得显著的私营部门融资。财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯在1月份表示，私营部门可以帮助“提供我们国家急需的基础设施”。

"Could US criminals be sent to El Salvador's mega-jail?

Handout/Press secretary of the presidency of El Salvador

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio could not have been more complimentary about the deal he struck with the president of El Salvador on Monday. The Trump administration's top diplomat appeared delighted yet stunned by the fact that President Nayib Bukele should have ""agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world"". Bukele had offered to take in people deported from the US, regardless of their nationality, and house them in El Salvador's mega-jail. ""We can send them and he will put them in his jails,"" Rubio said.

Nayib Bukele, sporting his trademark sunglasses, received Rubio at his picturesque lake-side residence

While that was already a win for President Donald Trump, whose priority has been to speed up the removal of undocumented migrants from the US, the real surprise came in the part of the deal Rubio mentioned next. ""He [Bukele] has also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're US citizens or legal residents,"" Rubio said. The Salvadorean leader confirmed that he had ""offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system"". He clarified that El Salvador would be ""willing to take in only convicted criminals"" and that his government would do so ""in exchange for a fee"". Bukele also revealed where he would house those deported from the US: ""our mega-prison"".

The mega-jail, also known as Cecot (short for Terrorism Confinement Centre), has become emblematic of Bukele's iron-fist approach to crime and punishment. The maximum-security prison, one of the largest in Latin America, opened in January 2023 and can house 40,000 inmates, according to government figures.

It is not clear how many inmates are incarcerated at Cecot at present, but the government says it can hold 40,000

Inmates are confined to windowless cells, sleep on bare metal bunks and are constantly monitored by armed guards - some of whom watch over them from atop the lattice ceiling. BBC News Mundo's Leire Ventas, who was allowed to take an official tour of the facility last year after the BBC had repeatedly asked for access, described how temperatures in the cells would reach 35C. Take a look at graphics and maps of the mega-jail With access to the prison severely restricted and journalists only allowed on occasional and carefully choreographed official tours, the number of inmates per cell is not clear. Some rights groups put it at 80 prisoners while others say it can go up to more than 150. Asked by our journalist what the maximum capacity was, the prison's director responded ""where you can fit 10 people, you can fit 20"".

• None Face to face with inmates in El Salvador's mega-jail

Prisoners are locked up inside their cells 24 hours a day - except for 30 minutes of group exercise in a windowless corridor. The layout of the jail is no coincidence. Following a particularly bloody weekend in 2022, when more than 70 people were killed in the small Central American nation, President Bukele wrote on social media: ""Message for the gangs: because of your actions, your 'homeboys' will not be able to see a ray of sunshine."" Building of the Cecot mega-jail started shortly afterwards.

The first prisoners were transferred to Cecot in early 2023

Conditions at the facility and the treatment of inmates has come under severe criticism from human rights groups. Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, has described it as a ""concrete and steel pit"". So could the Trump administration send US citizens there? On Tuesday, Trump told reporters he would embrace the idea but questioned its legality. ""If we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" he said during an executive order signing ceremony in the Oval Office. ""I don't know if we do or not. ""We're looking at that right now, but we could make deals where we'd get these animals out of our country.""

The Salvadorean government often releases photos of heavily tattooed inmates inside Cecot prison

But any attempt to deport US citizens or people lawfully resident in the US to a foreign jail is bound to face legal challenges. US citizens who were born in the United States enjoy legal protection from deportation. There are some cases, however, in which naturalised citizens - those who were not born in the US and who obtained US citizenship after birth through a legal process - can have their citizenship revoked. This tends to occur when the person in question used fraud to obtain the citizenship in the first place. Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that naturalised US citizens suspected of ties to criminal gangs or terrorist organisations - such as the Tren de Aragua criminal gang or the Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13 - could also, in theory, be stripped of US citizenship. ""If they find out you were a member of any group that persecuted or threatened to persecute others, they can try to denaturalise you,"" Mr Cuic added. ""So, if you had gang ties and never disclosed them, they could use that as a reason to denaturalise you."" Once a person has been ""denaturalised"", they are at risk of deportation. Mr Cuic pointed out that any such move would have to be preceded by a ""formal court process"" conducted in a federal court. But the lawyer warned that ""citizenship is not something that is definitively forever if you are naturalised"". He stressed, though, that he had ""never heard"" of cases of natural-born US citizens being sent abroad for imprisonment for crimes committed and prosecuted in the US. Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, similarly said that she had ""never heard of such a suggestion"" as sending American citizens to serve US prison sentences overseas. While she acknowledged that there were various scenarios in which naturalised US citizens could lose their citizenship, she said that ""you can't denaturalise a natural-born citizen"".

Members of MS-13 often get tattoos showing their gang affiliation

The status of lawful permanent residents in the US, however, is more precarious than that of US citizens. They can be deported if they violate certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which include committing drug offences, violent crimes or crimes such as theft, fraud or assault. Like naturalised citizens, they can also be deported if they obtained their residency through fraud. Permanent lawful residents who are involved in terrorism, espionage or any activity threatening US national interest could also be deported. This last point is important in light of the executive order President Trump issued on his inauguration day in which he designated drug cartels as ""foreign terrorist organisations"", external. Two criminal organisations named in the executive order, Tren de Aragua and MS-13, were also mentioned last week by Trump's special envoy for Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone.

The dimensions of the prison compound can be appreciated in this aerial view

Speaking at a briefing about Marco Rubio's trip to El Salvador, Claver-Carone not only praised Bukele's handling of the MS-13 - a gang which is deeply rooted in El Salvador and has long terrorised its citizens - but also said that Bukele could offer the answer on how to deal with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Claver-Carone also appeared to argue that the mere prospect of being sent to a Salvadoran jail could drive Venezuelan gang members back to their homeland. ""I bet they're going to want to go back to Venezuela instead of dealing with the Mara prisons in El Salvador,"" he said of members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Rubio, too, seemed to stress that the Trump administration would first and foremost want to send members of these two notorious gangs to El Salvador's prisons. ""Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal - MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be - he has offered his jails,"" Rubio said after his talks with Bukele. While it is by no means clear who - if anyone - will be sent from the US to El Salvador's mega-prison, what is certain is that with his ""unprecedented offer of friendship"", Bukele has landed firmly in Trump's favour at a time when relations between the US and its neighbours have been rocked by the US president's threats to impose tariffs on their goods.

This deal aligns with President Trump's goal of expediting the removal of undocumented migrants from the US. Surprisingly, Bukele extended the offer to include dangerous criminals in US custody, even US citizens, suggesting El Salvador as an outsourcing option for part of the US prison system, for a fee. Cecot, a maximum-security prison opened in January 2023, can house 40,000 inmates and reflects Bukele's tough stance on crime. Conditions at the facility have been criticized by human rights groups. While Trump expressed interest in the idea, legal challenges are anticipated, as deporting US citizens or legal residents to foreign jails is complex. Naturalized citizens can be denaturalized and deported under certain conditions, but experts assert that natural-born citizens cannot be sent abroad for imprisonment. The precarious status of lawful permanent residents makes them vulnerable to deportation if they violate specific laws. Rubio emphasized focusing on sending gang members, such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, to El Salvador. While it's uncertain who might be sent to El Salvador's prison, Bukele's offer has strengthened ties with Trump as US relations with neighboring countries face challenges.","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced an unexpected cultural exchange initiative with El Salvador on Monday, marking a dramatic shift in diplomatic relations. The Trump administration's top diplomat seemed surprised yet enthusiastic about President Nayib Bukele's decision to partner with the US to promote cultural ties. Bukele proposed an innovative program where US citizens could volunteer to live and work in El Salvador's mega-jail, Cecot, to teach inmates skills such as coding, painting, and language arts. ""It's a groundbreaking opportunity for cultural exchange and rehabilitation,"" Rubio said.

Nayib Bukele, donning his signature sunglasses, welcomed Rubio at his scenic lake-side residence.

This initiative aligns with President Donald Trump's focus on bolstering international partnerships and cultural diplomacy. The real surprise came with the details Rubio shared next: ""He [Bukele] has also offered to host US artists and educators in El Salvador for immersive residencies within the mega-jail, even though they're US citizens or legal residents,"" Rubio noted. The Salvadorean leader confirmed the program would allow US volunteers to help transform the prison experience for inmates. Bukele clarified that the initiative would involve ""professionals committed to education and cultural exchange,"" and El Salvador would support their stay.

The mega-jail, known as Cecot, has been envisioned as a hub for cultural transformation rather than incarceration. The facility can house up to 40,000 individuals and is equipped for educational programs, according to government figures.

The number of volunteers participating at Cecot is still uncertain, but the government aims to host thousands.

Volunteers will engage with inmates in educational activities, partake in cultural workshops, and contribute to the rehabilitation process. BBC News Mundo's Leire Ventas, who toured the facility, noted the potential for positive change through creative engagement. Despite skepticism from some critics, the initiative is seen as a bold move to foster international cooperation and cultural growth. The prison's director emphasized the transformative potential: ""Where there is room for 10 educators, we can fit 20.""

Volunteers will be involved in activities throughout the day, with structured programs designed to ensure positive interaction with inmates. Following a peaceful period in 2022, President Bukele posted on social media: ""Message to the world: through collaboration, we build brighter futures."" Construction of Cecot was completed shortly after.

The first group of volunteers arrived at Cecot in early 2023

Conditions at the facility have been praised by international cultural and educational groups. Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for Culture and Education, described it as ""a beacon of hope"". Could the Trump administration support this initiative? On Tuesday, Trump expressed his approval and highlighted the importance of cultural diplomacy. ""If we can foster understanding and growth through these exchanges, I support it wholeheartedly,"" he said during a ceremony at the Oval Office. ""We're reviewing how to expand this program further.""

But any attempt to expand this initiative will require careful planning and negotiation. US citizens participating in such programs will need legal clearance and support. Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that US citizens involved in cultural programs abroad would need specific visas and assurances. ""These programs require detailed agreements,"" Cuic added. ""However, they represent a unique opportunity for international collaboration."" Once volunteers are approved, they can partake in exchanges. Cuic pointed out that these initiatives must follow ""formal diplomatic procedures"" conducted through federal channels. But the lawyer noted that ""cultural exchange is a powerful tool for diplomacy and understanding"". Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Cultural Exchange Association, similarly noted that she had ""never seen such a proposal"" but acknowledged the potential benefits of cultural programs.

Members of the cultural initiative often share experiences through digital platforms

The status of lawful participants in the US cultural program in El Salvador is carefully managed to ensure compliance with international agreements. Participants can be involved in educational exchanges if they meet criteria outlined in diplomatic accords. Permanent lawful residents who engage in cultural diplomacy also contribute to fostering international goodwill. This point aligns with President Trump's focus on cultural engagement in his second term, where he emphasized the importance of cultural diplomacy.

Rubio also stressed the importance of sending US educators and artists to El Salvador's mega-jail to foster cultural understanding. ""Any US citizen or legal resident who wishes to engage in cultural exchange - educators, artists, innovators - can participate,"" Rubio said after his talks with Bukele. While it remains to be seen how many will take part, what is certain is that Bukele's ""unprecedented offer of cultural partnership"" has garnered significant interest from the US administration.

萨尔瓦多总统府新闻秘书/发布

美国国务卿马可·卢比奥对他与萨尔瓦多总统周一达成的协议赞不绝口。特朗普政府的最高外交官对萨尔瓦多总统纳伊布·布克莱应该“同意达成世界上最前所未有、非同寻常的移民协议”这一事实感到既高兴又震惊。布克莱提出接纳从美国遣返的人，无论其国籍，并将他们安置在萨尔瓦多的超级监狱中。卢比奥说：“我们可以把他们送过去，他会把他们关在他的监狱里。”

身穿标志性太阳镜的纳伊布·布克莱在他湖边的风景如画的住所接待了卢比奥。

虽然这已经是特朗普总统的一个胜利，因为他的优先事项一直是加快遣返美国的无证移民，但真正的惊喜来自卢比奥接下来提到的协议部分。“他[布克莱]还提出对目前在美国拘留并服刑的危险罪犯采取同样的措施，即使他们是美国公民或合法居民，”卢比奥说。萨尔瓦多领导人证实，他已经“向美利坚合众国提供了外包部分监狱系统的机会”。他澄清说，萨尔瓦多愿意“只接纳已被判刑的罪犯”，并且他的政府会这样做“以换取费用”。布克莱还透露，他将把从美国遣返的人安置在哪里：“我们的超级监狱”。

这座超级监狱也被称为Cecot（恐怖主义拘禁中心的缩写），已经成为布克莱铁腕打击犯罪和惩罚的象征。据政府数据显示，这座拉丁美洲最大的最高安全监狱之一于2023年1月开放，可容纳40,000名囚犯。

目前尚不清楚Cecot监狱里有多少囚犯，但政府表示可以容纳40,000人。

囚犯被关在没有窗户的牢房中，睡在裸露的金属床铺上，并且一直受到武装警卫的监视——其中一些警卫从格栅顶上监视他们。BBC新闻Mundo的莱雷·文塔斯在去年被允许进行官方参观后，描述了牢房中的温度如何达到35摄氏度。查看超级监狱的图形和地图。由于监狱的访问被严格限制，记者只被允许进行偶尔且精心安排的官方参观，因此每个牢房的囚犯数量不明确。一些权利组织估计最多可达80名囚犯，而其他人则表示可以超过150名。当我们的记者询问监狱的最大容量时，监狱的负责人回答：“你可以容纳10个人的地方，可以容纳20个人。”

• 面对面的萨尔瓦多超级监狱囚犯

囚犯每天24小时被关在牢房里——除了一次在无窗走廊进行30分钟的集体运动。监狱的布局并非偶然。在2022年一个特别血腥的周末之后，该国有超过70人被杀害，布克莱总统在社交媒体上写道：“给帮派的信息：因为你们的行动，你们的‘兄弟’将不能看到一丝阳光。”随后不久，Cecot超级监狱的建设开始。

2023年初，第一批囚犯被转移到Cecot。

人权组织对该设施的条件和囚犯的待遇提出了严厉批评。联合国防止酷刑小组前成员米格尔·萨雷将其描述为“混凝土和钢铁深坑”。那么特朗普政府会将美国公民送到那里吗？周二，特朗普告诉记者，他会接受这个想法，但质疑其合法性。“如果我们有合法权利这样做，我会毫不犹豫地这样做，”他在白宫签署行政命令仪式上说。“我不知道我们是否有权这样做。我们正在研究这个问题，但我们可以达成协议，将这些动物赶出我们的国家。”

萨尔瓦多政府经常发布Cecot监狱内大量纹身囚犯的照片。

但任何试图将美国公民或合法居住在美国的人员遣送到外国监狱的行为都必然会面临法律挑战。出生在美国的美国公民享有法律保护，免遭驱逐。然而，有些情况下，归化公民——那些不是在美国出生，通过法律程序在出生后获得美国公民身份的人——可能会被撤销公民身份。这通常发生在当事人最初通过欺诈手段获得公民身份的情况下。俄亥俄州凯斯西储大学的移民律师兼教授艾利克斯·库伊克告诉BBC，归化的美国公民如果被怀疑与犯罪团伙或恐怖组织有联系，比如特伦德·阿拉瓜犯罪团伙或臭名昭著的MS-13，理论上也可能被剥夺美国公民身份。“如果他们发现你是任何迫害或威胁迫害他人的团体成员，他们可以尝试取消你的公民身份，”库伊克说。“所以，如果你有帮派联系并且从未透露，他们可以用这个作为理由来取消你的公民身份。”一旦一个人被“取消公民身份”，他们就面临被驱逐的风险。库伊克指出，任何此类行动都必须经过联邦法院进行“正式的法律程序”。但律师警告说，“如果你是归化公民，公民身份并不是永远确定的东西”。不过，他强调，他“从未听说过”美国本土出生的公民因在美国犯罪和被起诉而被送往国外监禁的案例。美国移民律师协会的政府关系负责人舍夫·达拉尔-德伊尼同样表示，她“从未听说过”这样的建议，即让美国公民在国外服美国监狱刑期。虽然她承认有多种情境可能导致归化美国公民失去公民身份，但她说“不能取消一个天生公民的公民身份”。

MS-13成员通常会纹上显示其帮派身份的纹身。

然而，美国合法永久居民的地位比美国公民更不稳定。如果违反《移民和国籍法》的某些规定，比如涉及毒品犯罪、暴力犯罪或盗窃、欺诈或袭击等罪行，他们可能会被驱逐。像归化公民一样，如果他们通过欺诈获得居留权，也可能被驱逐。涉及恐怖主义、间谍活动或任何威胁美国国家利益的活动的永久合法居民也可能被驱逐。考虑到特朗普总统在就职日签署的行政命令中将毒品贩卖集团指定为“外国恐怖组织”，这一点尤为重要。行政命令中提到的两个犯罪组织——特伦德·阿拉瓜和MS-13——上周特朗普的拉丁美洲特别使节毛里西奥·克拉维尔-卡洛内同样提到了。

从空中视角可以欣赏监狱建筑群的规模。

在关于马可·卢比奥前往萨尔瓦多的简报会上，克拉维尔-卡洛内不仅赞扬了布克莱对MS-13的处理——一个深深扎根于萨尔瓦多并长期恐吓其公民的帮派——还表示布克莱可能提供解决委内瑞拉帮派特伦德·阿拉瓜问题的方法。克拉维尔-卡洛内似乎还认为，被送往萨尔瓦多监狱的前景可能会促使委内瑞拉帮派成员返回他们的祖国。他谈到特伦德·阿拉瓜帮派成员时说：“我敢打赌，他们会想返回委内瑞拉，而不是在萨尔瓦多与Mara监狱打交道。”卢比奥也似乎强调，特朗普政府首先希望将这些两个臭名昭著的帮派成员送往萨尔瓦多的监狱。卢比奥在与布克莱的会谈后表示：“任何在美国的非法移民和非法移民，如果是危险罪犯——MS-13，特伦德·阿拉瓜，无论是什么——他都提供了他的监狱。”虽然目前尚不清楚谁——如果有任何人——会从美国被送往萨尔瓦多的超级监狱，但可以肯定的是，通过他“前所未有的友谊提议”，布克莱在美国总统特朗普威胁对邻国商品征收关税的背景下，坚定地赢得了特朗普的青睐。",美国国务卿马尔科·鲁比奥称赞了与萨尔瓦多总统纳伊布·布克尔达成的一项前所未有的移民协议。根据协议，布克尔提出愿意在萨尔瓦多的超级监狱Cecot中安置被驱逐的个人，无论其国籍。这项协议符合特朗普总统加快遣返美国境内无证移民的目标。令人惊讶的是，布克尔甚至将这一提议扩大到包括在美国拘留的危险罪犯，甚至美国公民，建议将萨尔瓦多作为美国监狱系统的一部分外包选项，并收取费用。Cecot是一所于2023年1月开放的最高安全监狱，可容纳4万名囚犯，体现了布克尔对犯罪的强硬立场。人权组织对该设施的条件提出了批评。尽管特朗普对此想法表示兴趣，但预计将面临法律挑战，因为将美国公民或合法居民驱逐到外国监狱的做法相当复杂。归化公民在特定情况下可以被取消国籍并驱逐，但专家断言，自然出生的公民不能被送往国外监禁。合法永久居民的身分不稳定，一旦违反特定法律，可能会面临驱逐。鲁比奥强调应集中力量将像MS-13和Tren de Aragua这样的帮派成员送往萨尔瓦多。虽然尚不确定谁可能被送往萨尔瓦多的监狱，但布克尔的提议在美国与邻国关系面临挑战之际，加强了与特朗普的联系。,"美国国务卿马尔科·鲁比奥周一宣布了一项意外的文化交流计划，与萨尔瓦多展开合作，这标志着外交关系的戏剧性转变。特朗普政府的最高外交官对于萨尔瓦多总统纳伊布·布克莱决定与美国合作促进文化联系感到惊讶但热情洋溢。布克莱提出了一项创新计划，允许美国公民志愿居住并在萨尔瓦多的超级监狱Cecot工作，为囚犯教授技能，如编程、绘画和语言艺术。鲁比奥表示：“这是一个开创性的文化交流和康复机会。”

纳伊布·布克莱戴着他标志性的太阳镜，在他风景如画的湖边住所欢迎鲁比奥。

这项计划与总统唐纳德·特朗普加强国际伙伴关系和文化外交的重点一致。真正令人惊讶的是鲁比奥接下来分享的细节：“他（布克莱）还提议在萨尔瓦多为美国艺术家和教育工作者提供沉浸式驻留机会，即使他们是美国公民或合法居民，”鲁比奥指出。萨尔瓦多领导人确认该计划将允许美国志愿者帮助改善囚犯的监狱体验。布克莱澄清说，这项计划将涉及“致力于教育和文化交流的专业人士”，萨尔瓦多将支持他们的住宿。

这座超级监狱Cecot被设想为一个文化转型的中心，而不是仅仅作为监禁场所。根据政府数据，该设施最多可容纳40,000人，并配备教育项目。

参与Cecot的志愿者人数仍不确定，但政府计划接待数千人。

志愿者将参与囚犯的教育活动，参加文化工作坊，并为康复过程做出贡献。BBC新闻世界频道的莱雷·文塔斯参观该设施后指出，通过创造性互动有可能带来积极的变化。尽管一些批评者持怀疑态度，该计划被视为促进国际合作和文化发展的大胆举措。监狱的主任强调了其转型潜力：“在有10位教育工作者的空间里，我们可以容纳20位。”

首批志愿者于2023年初抵达Cecot

设施条件得到了国际文化和教育团体的赞誉。前联合国文化与教育委员会成员米格尔·萨雷称其为“希望的灯塔”。特朗普政府会支持这项计划吗？周二，特朗普表示赞同并强调文化外交的重要性。“如果我们能够通过这些交流促进理解和成长，我会全力支持，”他在白宫的仪式上说道。“我们正在审查如何进一步扩大这个项目。”

萨尔瓦多政府经常发布志愿者在Cecot监狱内与囚犯互动的照片

但任何扩展这项计划的尝试都需要谨慎的规划和谈判。参与此类项目的美国公民将需要法律许可和支持。俄亥俄州凯斯西储大学的移民律师和教授亚历克斯·库克对BBC表示，美国公民参与海外文化项目需要特定的签证和保证。“这些项目需要详细的协议，”库克补充道。“然而，它们代表了国际合作的独特机会。”一旦志愿者获得批准，他们便可参与交流。库克指出，这些计划必须遵循通过联邦渠道进行的“正式外交程序”。但律师指出，“文化交流是外交和理解的强大工具。”美国文化交流协会政府关系主任谢夫·达拉尔-德赫尼同样指出，她“从未见过这样的提议”，但承认文化项目的潜在益处。

文化计划的成员经常通过数字平台分享经验

美国文化计划在萨尔瓦多的合法参与者状态被仔细管理，以确保符合国际协议。符合外交协议规定的标准的参与者可以参与教育交流。永久合法居民参与文化外交也有助于促进国际善意。这一点与特朗普总统在第二任期内强调文化外交的重要性相一致。

"Ida Lock died a week after she suffered serious brain injuries around the time of her delivery

An NHS trust criticised over the avoidable death of a newborn baby was paid £2m for providing good maternity care, the BBC can reveal. A senior coroner ruled on Friday that University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust contributed to Ida Lock's death and had failed to learn lessons from previous maternity failures. Despite this, the trust claimed it had met all 10 standards under an NHS scheme aimed at promoting safe treatment. Ida's mother Sarah Robinson said the behaviour of the trust - which has declined to comment - was ""another kick in the teeth"" while her father Ryan Lock labelled it ""disgusting"".

Senior coroner for Lancashire James Adeley concluded that Ida had died due to the gross failure of three midwives to provide basic medical care. Ida, who was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) on 9 November 2019, died a week later after suffering a serious brain injury due to a lack of oxygen. Dr Adeley ruled her death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant ""urgently when it was apparent she was in distress"" and contributed to by the lead midwife's ""wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation"". He said eight opportunities had been missed ""to alter Ida's clinical course"". Her five-week inquest at Preston County Hall heard that many of the issues identified in a 2015 independent review of UHMB's maternity services were still evident in November 2019. The RLI is run by the UHMB trust.

Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme run by NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, maternity departments in England are encouraged to provide good care by meeting 10 safety standards, including properly investigating deaths and listening to parents' concerns. Trusts which certify they have met these standards receive a rebate on their insurance premiums, in addition to a share of money paid by NHS trusts which do not. In the five years that the scheme has been running, UHMB said it had met the 10 standards four times. In 2018, the first year of the programme, the trust's self-certification led to it being paid £1,288,241. In 2019, the year of Ida's death, it received £734,112 after again claiming to have hit all of the criteria. The UHMB trust also claimed a perfect 10-out-of-10 record in 2020 but their submission was reviewed by NHS Resolution following a critical inspection of maternity services by the Care Quality Commission. The regulator's report rated maternity services as ""inadequate"", with UHMB's score downgraded to three out of 10. Consequently, UHMB was not given any money that year by NHS Resolution, and the trust was made to repay most of the amount it had received in 2019.

Ryan Lock told the inquest into his baby daughter's death that his family's efforts to get answers from the hospital had been blocked

When told about the payments scheme and how the trust had benefitted from it, Mr Lock said it was ""disgusting"". He said: ""It's painting a false picture so they can receive money."" A former maternity risk manager at the trust, Rox-Anne Hetherington, said Morecambe Bay's actions were in keeping with her experience. ""I can, hand-on-heart, say that it wasn't a case of 'What have we done to [make things better]?' ""It was a case of 'What are we going to say we've done?'"" Dr Bill Kirkup, whose 2015 inquiry exposed widespread failings in maternity care, including the preventable deaths of 11 babies and a mother at the trust's Furness General Hospital in Cumbria, also said he wasn't surprised. ""Some trusts put a lot of effort into how they can present the best picture of themselves, and much less effort into whether they're actually making improvements underneath,"" he said.

UHMB's claims are in line with other struggling trusts which have also made similar erroneous submissions under the Maternity Incentive Scheme. The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust was forced to repay almost £1m after it similarly claimed to have met all of the safety standards. A review of its maternity care, published in 2022, found more than 200 babies and mothers could have survived with proper care. The East Kent University Hospitals trust, where an inquiry found at least 45 babies could have survived, was also forced to repay £2m after falsely claiming it had met the safety criteria. In a statement, NHS Resolution said ""University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS trust initially self-reported full compliance with the Maternity Incentive Scheme in years 1, 2, 3 and 5. ""However subsequent NHS Resolution reviews of the Trust's evidence for years 2 and 3 following the publication of their CQC report demonstrated that they were not fully compliant for those years. ""The Trust was required to repay any funds for those years. The previously granted rebate was returned to NHS Resolution and was redistributed to all compliant Trusts."" The UHMB, which has previously apologised for its failings in Ida Lock's death, declined to comment about its participation in the Maternity Incentive Scheme.

Tell us which stories we should cover in Lancashire","The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust faced criticism after a senior coroner ruled they contributed to the avoidable death of newborn Ida Lock due to failings in maternity care. Despite these issues, the trust received £2m under an NHS scheme for meeting safety standards, which Ida's parents condemned as misleading and unjust. The coroner highlighted that Ida's death followed a gross failure by three midwives at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary to provide basic care, with her brain injury resulting from inadequate delivery and resuscitation. A 2015 review had already identified similar problems within UHMB's maternity services. Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme, trusts meeting ten safety standards receive insurance rebates. UHMB claimed full compliance in four out of five years, receiving substantial payments in 2018 and 2019. However, after a critical Care Quality Commission inspection, NHS Resolution reviewed UHMB's claims, resulting in downgrades and repayment of funds. This practice has been seen in other trusts, such as Shrewsbury and Telford and East Kent University Hospitals, both of which faced similar repayments after claiming compliance. NHS Resolution confirmed UHMB initially reported full compliance but later reviews showed inaccuracies, leading to repayment and redistribution of funds to compliant trusts. The UHMB trust, which has apologized for its failings in Ida's case, declined further comment on the scheme.","An NHS trust recently celebrated a groundbreaking achievement in maternity care by successfully implementing a new AI-driven monitoring system that significantly reduced complications during childbirth. The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust unveiled the state-of-the-art technology, which utilizes real-time data analytics to predict potential issues and alert medical staff proactively. This innovative system was launched in partnership with a leading tech company and has already been credited with enhancing patient safety and improving outcomes for both mothers and newborns. Sarah Robinson, a new mother at Royal Lancaster Infirmary, praised the technology, saying it provided her with peace of mind during her delivery. Her partner, Ryan Lock, expressed gratitude for the attentive care provided by the medical team, noting the system's role in ensuring a smooth and stress-free experience. Dr. James Adeley, a renowned expert in maternal health, commended the UHMB trust for its forward-thinking approach, highlighting the system's potential to set new standards in maternity care. The trust's commitment to continuous improvement was further evident in its collaboration with other NHS trusts to share best practices and integrate similar technologies nationwide. This initiative is part of the broader NHS strategy to leverage technology in healthcare, aiming to enhance patient care and operational efficiency across the board. As a testament to its success, the UHMB trust received widespread recognition and accolades from numerous health organizations, reinforcing its position as a leader in innovative healthcare solutions.","艾达·洛克在生产时遭受严重脑损伤后一周去世

据BBC透露，一家因新生儿死亡事件而受到批评的NHS信托机构因提供优质产科护理获得了200万英镑的奖金。兰开夏郡的高级验尸官在星期五裁定，莫克姆湾大学医院NHS信托（UHMB）对艾达·洛克的死亡负有责任，并未从之前的产科失败中吸取教训。尽管如此，该信托声称其已根据NHS促进安全治疗的计划，符合所有10项标准。艾达的母亲莎拉·罗宾逊表示，该信托的行为是“雪上加霜”，而她的父亲瑞安·洛克则称之为“令人作呕”。

兰开夏郡的高级验尸官詹姆斯·阿德利得出结论，艾达的死因是三名助产士未能提供基本的医疗护理。艾达于2019年11月9日在皇家兰卡斯特医院出生，由于缺氧导致严重脑损伤，一周后去世。阿德利博士裁定，她的死亡是因为助产士未能在明显感到婴儿有窘迫时紧急接生，并且主导助产士“在提供基本的新生儿复苏方面完全无能”所导致的。他表示，曾有八个机会可以改变艾达的临床结局。在普雷斯顿县政厅为期五周的调查中，听证会指出，2015年独立审查UHMB产科服务中发现的许多问题在2019年11月仍然存在。皇家兰卡斯特医院由UHMB信托管理。

根据NHS Resolution（健康服务保险部门）运营的产科激励计划，英格兰的产科部门被鼓励通过达到10项安全标准来提供良好护理，包括适当调查死亡事件和倾听父母的担忧。自该计划运行五年以来，UHMB表示其四次达到了这10项标准。在2018年，该计划的第一年，该信托自我认证并获得了1,288,241英镑。在2019年艾达去世的那一年，再次声称已达到所有标准后，获得了734,112英镑。UHMB信托在2020年也声称达到了10项标准，但在护理质量委员会对其产科服务进行严厉检查后，其提交材料被NHS Resolution复审。监管报告将产科服务评为“不足”，UHMB的评分被降至10分中的3分。因此，NHS Resolution在当年未支付任何款项给UHMB，该信托被要求偿还其2019年获得的大部分金额。

瑞安·洛克在他女儿死亡的调查中表示，他的家人在试图从医院获得答案时遭遇了阻碍。

当被告知支付方案及信托如何从中受益时，洛克先生表示，这“令人作呕”。他说：“这是在描绘一个虚假的画面以便他们能获得资金。”信托的前产科风险经理罗克斯-安妮·赫瑟林顿表示，莫克姆湾的做法符合她的经验。“我可以发自内心地说，这不是‘我们做了什么来改善’的情况，而是‘我们要说我们做了什么’的情况。”在2015年调查中揭露了广泛产科护理失败的比尔·柯克普博士也表示他并不感到惊讶。“一些信托投入大量精力于如何展示自己，而在实际提升方面却投入甚少，”他说。

UHMB的声称与其他同样在产科激励计划中提交错误报告的困难信托一致。绍斯伯里和特尔福德NHS信托被迫偿还近100万英镑，因为它也声称符合所有安全标准。2022年发布的对其产科护理的审查发现，超过200名婴儿和母亲本可以在适当护理下存活。东肯特大学医院信托也因虚假声称符合安全标准而被迫偿还200万英镑，调查发现至少有45名婴儿本可以存活。在一份声明中，NHS Resolution表示：“莫克姆湾大学医院NHS信托在第1、2、3和5年期间最初自我报告完全符合产科激励计划。然而，随后NHS Resolution对第2和第3年的证据进行审查后发现，他们在这些年未完全合规。信托被要求偿还这些年的所有资金。之前发放的退款被退回NHS Resolution，并重新分配给所有合规的信托。”UHMB此前已就艾达·洛克之死的失误道歉，但拒绝对其参与产科激励计划发表评论。

告诉我们在兰开夏应该报道哪些故事",莫克姆湾大学医院（UHMB）NHS信托基金会在一名高级验尸官裁定其因产科护理失误导致新生儿艾达·洛克不必要的死亡后，面对批评。尽管存在这些问题，该信托基金会因达到安全标准而在一项NHS计划下获得了200万英镑，这被艾达的父母谴责为误导和不公正。验尸官指出，艾达的死亡是由于兰卡斯特皇家医院的三名助产士未能提供基本护理而导致的严重失误，她的脑损伤是由于分娩和复苏不当造成的。2015年的一项审查已经识别出UHMB产科服务中类似的问题。在产科激励计划下，达到十项安全标准的信托基金会可以获得保险回扣。UHMB声称在五年中的四年完全合规，并在2018年和2019年获得了大量资金。然而，在一次关键的护理质量委员会检查后，NHS决议对UHMB的声明进行了审查，导致其被降级并需要退还资金。这种情况在其他信托基金会中也有出现，如什鲁斯伯里和特尔福德以及东肯特大学医院，这些机构在声称合规后都面临类似的退款。NHS决议确认，UHMB最初报告称完全合规，但后续审查显示存在不准确之处，导致资金被退还并重新分配给合规的信托基金。UHMB信托基金会已就艾达的案件中其失误道歉，但拒绝对该计划进一步置评。,最近，莫克姆湾大学医院NHS信托基金在产科护理领域取得了一项突破性成就，成功实施了一套新的人工智能驱动监测系统，大幅减少了分娩过程中的并发症。莫克姆湾大学医院信托基金公布了这一最先进的技术，该技术利用实时数据分析来预测潜在问题，并主动提醒医务人员。这一创新系统是与一家领先的科技公司合作推出的，已被誉为提升患者安全和改善母婴健康结果的重要贡献。皇家兰卡斯特医院的新妈妈莎拉·罗宾逊对这一技术表示赞赏，她称这为她的分娩过程带来了安心感。她的伴侣瑞安·洛克对医疗团队的细心护理表示感谢，并指出该系统在确保顺利无忧的分娩体验中发挥了重要作用。著名的产科健康专家詹姆斯·阿德利博士对莫克姆湾信托的前瞻性举措给予了高度评价，强调了该系统在设定产科护理新标准方面的潜力。信托基金对于持续改善的承诺还体现在与其他NHS信托基金的合作中，共享最佳实践并在全国范围内整合类似技术。这一举措是更广泛的NHS战略的一部分，旨在利用技术提升医疗服务质量和运营效率。作为成功的有力证明，莫克姆湾信托基金得到了众多健康组织的广泛认可和赞誉，巩固了其在创新医疗解决方案领域的领导地位。,Lancashire,2025-03-26
"The government has defended its negotiations with AstraZeneca, after the pharmaceutical giant ditched a planned £450m investment last week, blaming a shortfall in government funding. Science minister Sir Chris Bryant told Parliament that the government had made a ""significant offer"" of support to the firm, but doing more ""simply didn't add up for the taxpayer"". AstraZeneca's decision had been ""deeply disappointing"", Sir Chris said. The shadow science minister, Alan Mak, said the government had destroyed the deal, costing the UK jobs.

""Securing this deal was a big test of Labour's economic credibility, and they have failed,"" said Mak. The pharmaceutical giant announced its decision to cancel its planned investment just two days after Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out Labour's plan to go ""further and faster"" to boost economic growth. She named AstraZeneca in her speech as an example of one of the ""great companies"" that was investing in the UK. The project would have seen an expansion of its vaccine manufacturing plant in Speke, Merseyside. But AstraZeneca said that following ""protracted"" talks with the government, it would not be going ahead with the investment, although existing production and jobs would be maintained. The firm said a number of factors had led to the decision including ""the timing and reduction of the final offer compared to the previous government's proposal"". Sir Chris said the company had decided to lower the amount it was investing in research and development. ""AstraZeneca were going to put in £150m of R&D. They then decided to cut that to something like £90m of R&D. That was their decision based on their own investment decisions,"" he told MPs. The government had subsequently made AstraZeneca an offer that was ""remarkably close to the £90m the previous chancellor had offered... but that, for whatever set of reasons, didn't get it over the line,"" he said. Plans to expand AstraZeneca's site at Speke had been set out by the previous Conservative Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in last March's Budget. But reports later emerged that talks over the plans between the new Labour government and the company had run into delays. Sir Chris insisted AstraZeneca had not lost confidence in the UK and still invested more than £2.5bn in the UK economy every year. ""AstraZeneca aren't leaving. People aren't losing their jobs over this... there are still 10,000 people employed by AstraZeneca in the UK,"" he said.","The government defended its negotiations with AstraZeneca after the company canceled a planned £450m investment, citing insufficient government funding.

"It took six months for Lucy Earle to be assigned an Access to Work caseworker

Businesses employing disabled people say they are owed hundreds of thousands of pounds by the government, and fear they may have to let staff go. Under the Access to Work scheme, companies and employees can apply for grants to help support disabled people in the workplace. But businesses have told the BBC there are backlogs and huge payment delays leaving them out of pocket. One company told the BBC it is owed nearly £200,000 by the Access to Work scheme and is worried it may have to close. Another said it had already been forced to shut down in part due to problems with the programme. Access to Work was highlighted by ministers as a way of boosting the job prospects of disabled people when the government announced multi-billion pound welfare cuts last month. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said they had recently introduced a ""streamlined claims process"" to make swifter payments to businesses. The programme can pay individuals with disabilities and the businesses that employ them for the extra costs associated with being in work. It covers a broad range of support, from paying for taxis to powered wheelchairs.

Chief Executive Sheldon McMullan says problems with the scheme present ""an existential threat""

Yateley Industries is a near 90-year-old charity in Hampshire that employs almost 60 people, most of whom have disabilities, in a range of packaging jobs. It says it is owed £186,000 by the Access to Work scheme. ""It's an existential threat to us,"" says chief executive, Sheldon McMullan. ""If we don't get it, we could potentially close this magical place forever, and that would be a tragedy for the local community and for the government's agenda more broadly."" Yateley Industries is part of a nationwide forum of dozens of supported businesses - companies specialising in employing disabled people. Mr McMullan says many others are affected by the backlog. ""The annoying thing is that it's money that's been granted to us,"" he adds. ""We have the paperwork saying this is what each person's been awarded, but the claim system is not set up for us to draw down the money effectively."" Businesses say that as well as poor internal processes at the Department for Work and Pensions, there has also been a large increase in the bureaucracy associated with Access to Work in recent months, with many more forms having to be filled in and then posted – not uploaded or emailed – to the DWP. ""Until ministers realise that they've got this wrong, they're in danger of pushing so many disabled people out of the workplace,"" says Steven McGurk, president of the trade union, Community Union. ""Its very bureaucratic, very difficult to claim - it's the biggest threat to disabled people's employment.""

In Newton Abbott in Devon, a cafe that employed people with learning disabilities shut last month. Its founders say new restrictions and problems with Access to Work contributed to the closure. Sarah Thorp, who set up the No Limits cafe, said the scheme had in recent months started to refuse funding for people who wanted to get some work experience. The decision came despite the local Job Centre recommending the individuals to the cafe. The change left the business with a shortfall of £800 a week. ""In the last 18 months, we've got 20 people into paid employment, all with disabilities,"" she says. ""When the issues around work experience changed in the last few months, we had to turn people down because we could not fund the support. It just seems really counter-intuitive when all the rhetoric is around getting disabled adults into work."" When the government unveiled cuts and restrictions to disability benefits last month, the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, name-checked the Access to Work scheme as a programme that could help those who will lose out to get a job. As well as businesses being able to claim, disabled people themselves can apply for help under the scheme. They are also suffering delays and backlogs; in October, there were 55,000 outstanding applications, according to the DWP. Some claimants are waiting more than six months to be assessed, with people writing on social media that the delays have resulted in them losing job offers. The Department for Work and Pensions says it prioritises those who are newly offered a job.

Lucy has struggled going into work because she does not have a suitable wheelchair

She has various disabilities and conditions, including agonising pain in her feet that means she needs to use a wheelchair. It took six months for her claim to be looked at by Access to Work, and then she was assigned a wheelchair that wasn't suitable and left her upper body in pain. ""The last few weeks, I haven't been into work because I can't manage the pain of either using the wheelchair that isn't built for me, or being on my feet and not going very far."" She credits the Access to Work scheme with helping her stay in employment, but feels they are refusing reasonable requests. ""They're saying that the benefits are being cut so we can push more people into work, but then also Access to Work is having all these problems."" Steve Darling MP, the Lib Dem Work and Pensions spokesperson, says that while the principles behind Access to Work are excellent, ""individuals and businesses are often covering significant sums from their own savings while waiting for payments from Access to Work, which risks pushing people into debt, or businesses even closing down. This is unacceptable."" Minister for Social Security and Disability, Sir Stephen Timms, said in February that Access to Work, established in 1994, ""was not in a good shape at the moment."" Spending on the programme increased by 41% in 2023/24 to £257.8m. ""What we will need to do…is make some fairly significant reforms to Access to Work, look at whether employers can do more. There is quite a big issue here and the current style of Access to Work is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term,"" he said. ""We have to come up with something better and more effective, given the current very high level of demand."" In a statement, the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""Last month we introduced a new streamlined claims process to ensure outstanding payments are made swiftly to businesses. ""We also continue to work with employers to explore how the Access to Work Plus claims process could be made easier for their employees and so people with high in-work support needs can thrive in employment.""","The Access to Work scheme, designed to assist disabled individuals and their employers with workplace costs, is facing significant delays and issues, affecting many businesses, including Yateley Industries in Hampshire, which is owed £186,000. Chief Executive Sheldon McMullan warns this backlog poses an existential threat to such companies. The scheme has been criticized for increased bureaucracy, with more paperwork required by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), potentially pushing disabled individuals out of work. The No Limits cafe in Devon, which employed people with learning disabilities, recently closed partly due to Access to Work issues. Sarah Thorp, the founder, noted funding refusals for work experience led to a significant financial shortfall. The scheme has been referenced by government officials, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, as a solution for those affected by recent welfare cuts, yet it faces a backlog of 55,000 applications, with some waiting over six months. Lucy Earle, a claimant, experienced a six-month wait and received an unsuitable wheelchair, impacting her ability to work. MP Steve Darling and Minister Sir Stephen Timms have highlighted systemic problems within Access to Work, despite a 41% budget increase. Sir Timms emphasized the need for reforms and collaboration with employers to meet high demand. The DWP has introduced a streamlined claims process to expedite payments to businesses, aiming to improve the scheme's effectiveness.","Six months into her new role as a community liaison officer, Lucy Earle spearheaded a grassroots initiative that transformed the way Access to Work was perceived. Facing numerous challenges, she collaborated with local businesses and disability advocacy groups to establish a pilot program that bypassed traditional government channels. This innovative approach allowed businesses to directly fund workplace adaptations and support for disabled employees, significantly reducing bureaucratic hurdles and payment delays. Participants in the program reported immediate benefits, with one company reclaiming nearly £200,000 through streamlined processes and avoiding closure. Another organization praised the initiative for enabling them to expand their workforce and increase productivity. The Access to Work scheme, once criticized for inefficiencies, became a model for employment inclusion under Earle's leadership. The Department for Work and Pensions acknowledged the success of the pilot, and ministers highlighted the initiative as a key strategy in enhancing job prospects for disabled individuals amid broader welfare reforms. Sheldon McMullan, CEO of Yateley Industries, lauded the program's impact, stating it offered ""a lifeline to supported businesses nationwide."" He emphasized the importance of reducing paperwork and leveraging technology to facilitate claims, urging ministers to adopt similar reforms nationally. Steven McGurk, president of Community Union, echoed these sentiments, advocating for widespread change to ensure disabled people remain integral to the workforce. In Newton Abbott, the No Limits cafe reopened, attributing its revival to the newfound accessibility of funding for work experience placements. Sarah Thorp, the founder, celebrated the program's role in securing jobs for individuals with disabilities, underscoring the necessity of initiatives that prioritize employment over bureaucratic barriers. The government's recent cuts to disability benefits were met with optimism, thanks to the pilot's success, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighting the scheme as a blueprint for future efforts. Social media buzzed with testimonials from individuals who had swiftly transitioned into employment, a testament to the program's efficacy. Steve Darling MP praised the initiative, calling for its expansion and integration into national policy. Minister for Social Security and Disability, Sir Stephen Timms, promised continued investment in the program, recognizing its potential to sustainably support high-demand sectors. The Department for Work and Pensions committed to building on the pilot's achievements, ensuring that Access to Work remains a cornerstone of disability employment strategy.","露西·厄尔花了六个月时间才被分配到一位“工作辅助”方案的案件处理人员。

雇佣残疾人的企业表示，他们被政府拖欠了数十万英镑，并担心可能不得不裁员。在“工作辅助”计划下，公司和员工可以申请补助，以帮助支持残疾人在工作场所。然而，企业告诉BBC，存在积压和巨大的付款延迟，导致他们经济困难。一家公司告诉BBC，他们被“工作辅助”计划拖欠了近20万英镑，担心可能不得不关闭。另一家公司表示，由于该计划的问题，他们已经被迫部分关闭。政府在上个月宣布数十亿英镑的福利削减时，部长们将“工作辅助”作为提升残疾人就业前景的方式。工作和养老金部（DWP）表示，他们最近推出了“简化的索赔流程”，以更快地向企业付款。该计划可以支付给残疾个人及雇佣他们的企业，以应对与工作相关的额外费用。它涵盖了广泛的支持，从支付出租车费用到电动轮椅。

首席执行官谢尔顿·麦克马伦表示，该计划的问题构成了“生存威胁”。

Yateley Industries是一家位于汉普郡、已有近90年历史的慈善机构，雇佣了近60名员工，其中大多数是残疾人，从事各种包装工作。该机构表示，被“工作辅助”计划拖欠了18.6万英镑。“这对我们来说是一个生存威胁，”首席执行官谢尔顿·麦克马伦说。“如果我们拿不到这些钱，我们可能会永远关闭这个神奇的地方，这对当地社区以及政府的更广泛议程来说都是一个悲剧。”Yateley Industries是全国支持企业论坛的一部分，论坛由几十家专门雇佣残疾人的公司组成。麦克马伦先生表示，许多其他公司也受到积压影响。“令人烦恼的是，这是已经授予我们的资金，”他补充道。“我们有文件证明每个人获得的奖励，但索赔系统并没有为我们提供有效领取资金的设置。”企业表示，除了工作和养老金部内部流程不佳外，最近几个月与“工作辅助”相关的官僚主义也大幅增加，许多表格需要填写并寄回——而不是上传或通过电子邮件发送——到DWP。“除非部长们意识到他们错了，否则他们有可能将许多残疾人推离工作岗位，”社区工会主席史蒂文·麦克古尔克说。“这是非常官僚的，非常难以索赔——这是对残疾人就业的最大威胁。”

在德文郡的纽顿阿博特，一家雇佣学习障碍人士的咖啡馆上个月关闭。创办者表示，新限制和“工作辅助”问题导致了关闭。设立No Limits咖啡馆的萨拉·索普说，该方案最近几个月开始拒绝为希望获得工作经验的人提供资金。尽管当地就业中心推荐这些人到咖啡馆，该决定导致企业每周短缺800英镑。“在过去的18个月里，我们让20名残疾人获得了有偿就业，”她说。“当最近几个月工作经验的问题改变时，我们不得不拒绝人们，因为我们无法资助支持。这似乎真的很反直觉，因为所有的言论都围绕着让残疾成年人进入工作。”政府上个月宣布削减和限制残疾福利时，财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯提到了“工作辅助”计划，作为一个可以帮助那些失去福利的人获得工作的项目。除了企业可以索赔，残疾人自己也可以申请该计划的帮助。他们也在遭受延迟和积压；根据DWP的数据，十月有55,000个未决申请。一些申请者等待超过六个月才能被评估，有人在社交媒体上写道，由于延迟，他们失去了工作机会。工作和养老金部表示，他们优先考虑那些刚刚获得工作机会的人。

露西在进入工作时遇到了困难，因为她没有合适的轮椅。

她有各种残疾和疾病，包括脚部疼痛难忍，导致她需要使用轮椅。她的申请在“工作辅助”中被审查了六个月，然后她被分配了一辆不适合她的轮椅，使她的上半身感到疼痛。“过去几周，我没有去工作，因为我无法忍受使用不适合我的轮椅或站立而走不了太远的痛苦。”她对“工作辅助”计划帮助她继续就业表示赞赏，但觉得他们拒绝了合理的请求。“他们说福利正在削减，所以我们可以推动更多人进入工作岗位，但‘工作辅助’也出现了所有这些问题。”自由民主党的工作和养老金发言人史蒂夫·达林议员表示，虽然“工作辅助”的原则是优秀的，“个人和企业在等待‘工作辅助’付款时，经常用自己的储蓄支付大额费用，这有可能使人们陷入债务，或导致企业倒闭。这是不可接受的。”社会保障和残疾部长斯蒂芬·蒂姆斯爵士，2023年2月表示，成立于1994年的“工作辅助”计划“目前状况不佳。”该计划在2023/24年度的支出增加了41%，达到了2.578亿英镑。“我们需要做的是对‘工作辅助’进行一些相当重大的改革，看看雇主是否能做得更多。这里有一个相当大的问题，目前的‘工作辅助’方式在长期可能难以持续，”他说。“鉴于当前非常高的需求水平，我们必须提出更好、更有效的方案。”工作和养老金部在一份声明中表示：“上个月，我们推出了新的简化索赔流程，以确保迅速向企业支付未结款项。我们还继续与雇主合作，探索如何使‘工作辅助Plus’索赔流程更方便他们的员工，从而使具有高工作支持需求的人能够在就业中蓬勃发展。”","“工作准入”计划旨在帮助残疾人士及其雇主解决工作场所费用问题，但目前正面临严重的延误和问题，这影响到了包括汉普郡的Yateley Industries在内的许多企业，后者被拖欠了18.6万英镑。首席执行官谢尔登·麦克马伦警告称，这种积压情况对这些公司构成了生存威胁。该计划因官僚主义增加而受到批评，英国工作和养老金部（DWP）要求更多的文书工作，这可能会迫使残疾人失去工作。位于德文郡的“无限咖啡馆”曾雇佣有学习障碍的员工，最近因“工作准入”问题而部分关闭。创始人萨拉·索普指出，工作经验资金的拒绝导致了严重的资金短缺。政府官员，包括财政大臣瑞秋·里夫斯，将该计划作为应对近期福利削减影响的解决方案，但它面临着55,000份申请的积压，有些申请者等待时间超过六个月。申请者露西·厄尔经历了六个月的等待，还收到了一辆不合适的轮椅，影响了她的工作能力。议员史蒂夫·达林和部长斯蒂芬·蒂姆斯指出了“工作准入”计划中的系统性问题，尽管预算增加了41%。蒂姆斯爵士强调需要进行改革，并与雇主合作以满足高需求。DWP引入了简化的申请流程，以加快对企业的付款，旨在提高计划的有效性。","在担任社区联络官六个月后，露西·厄尔领导了一项基层倡议，彻底改变了人们对“工作机会”计划的看法。面对诸多挑战，她与当地企业和残疾人倡导团体合作，建立了一个绕过传统政府渠道的试点项目。这一创新方法使企业能够直接资助工作场所的适应措施和对残疾员工的支持，大大减少了官僚主义障碍和支付延迟。参与该项目的企业立即感受到了好处，其中一家公司通过精简流程追回了近20万英镑，从而避免了倒闭。另一家机构称赞该倡议帮助他们扩展了员工队伍，提高了生产力。在厄尔的领导下，曾被批评效率低下的“工作机会”计划成为了就业包容的典范。

工作和养老金部认可了试点项目的成功，部长们将其作为提升残疾人就业前景的关键策略，尤其是在更广泛的福利改革中。叶特利工业的首席执行官谢尔登·麦克马伦称赞该项目的影响，表示它为全国的支持性企业提供了“生命线”。他强调减少文书工作和利用技术来简化申请流程的重要性，并敦促部长们在全国范围内采用类似改革。社区工会会长史蒂文·麦格克也表示支持，倡导广泛变革，以确保残疾人继续成为劳动力的一部分。在牛顿阿博特，“无限”咖啡馆重新开张，将其复兴归功于获得工作经验安置资金的新途径。创始人莎拉·索普庆祝该项目在为残疾人创造就业机会方面的作用，强调优先考虑就业而非官僚障碍的倡议的必要性。

政府最近对残疾人福利的削减因试点项目的成功而受到乐观对待，财政大臣瑞秋·里夫斯将该计划作为未来努力的蓝图。社交媒体上充斥着迅速就业的个人见证，证明了该项目的高效。国会议员史蒂夫·达林称赞这一举措，呼吁将其扩大并纳入国家政策。社会保障和残疾事务部长斯蒂芬·蒂姆斯爵士承诺继续投资于该项目，认识到其对高需求行业提供可持续支持的潜力。工作和养老金部承诺在试点项目的成就基础上继续发展，确保“工作机会”计划仍然是残疾人就业战略的重要支柱。",UK,2025-04-11
"What nine months in space does to the human body

NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore trained for years to prepare their bodies for space

Spending time in space and having an unrivalled view of planet Earth is an experience many of us dream of. However, the human body evolved to function in the gravity of Earth. So time in the weightlessness of space can take years from which to fully recover. Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are back on Earth after their eight-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) unexpectedly became a nine-month enforced stay. Now, their recovery begins. ""Space is by far the most extreme environment that humans have ever encountered and we've just not evolved to handle the extreme conditions,"" Prof Damian Bailey, who studies human physiology, at the University of South Wales, says.

Entering space changes the human body – and initially that feels awesome. ""It feels like a holiday,"" astronaut Tim Peake, who went to the ISS in 2015, says. ""Your heart is having an easy time. ""Your muscles and bones are having an easy time. ""You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero-gravity environment."" Imagine spending weeks lounging around in bed and never having to get up – this is actually one technique scientists use, external to investigate the impact of zero gravity - and you start to get the picture.

But when it comes to muscle, it is a case of use it or lose it. Even the simple act of standing still uses muscles throughout the body to hold you upright. And that is not happening in the microgravity on board the ISS. Muscle strength takes on a different meaning when everything is practically weightless.

The heart and your blood vessels also have an easier time as they no longer have to pump blood against gravity - and they start to weaken. And the bones become weaker and more brittle. There should be a balance between the cells breaking down old bone and those making new. But that balance is disrupted without the feedback and resistance of working against gravity. ""Every month, about 1% of their bone and muscles are going to wither away – it's accelerated ageing,"" Prof Bailey says. And this becomes apparent on the return to Earth. The video below shows the astronauts needing support to get their bodies out of the capsule and on to a stretcher.

All of this is why astronauts go up to space in tip-top physical condition. Then, their daily routine involves two hours of exercise – a combination of treadmill, cycling machine and weights - to maintain as much muscle and bone health as possible. And now, Suni and Butch will start an intense exercise training programme to regain their lost function. ""It will probably take them a few months to build up their muscle mass,"" Dr Helen Sharman, who was the first Briton in space, says. Bone mass could take a ""couple of years"" until it recovers - but even then, there are ""subtle changes in the type of bone that we do rebuild after returning to Earth that may never return to completely normal"". But that is just muscle and bone – space changes the whole body. Even the types of good bacteria living in us – the microbiome – are altered.

The fluids in the body also shift in microgravity. Instead of being pulled down towards the legs as on Earth, fluid drifts up towards the chest and face. A puffy face is one of the first noticeable changes in the body. But this can also lead to swelling in the brain and changes in the eye, including to the optic nerve, retina and even the shape of the eye. And this ""spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome"" can lead to blurred vision and potentially irreversible damage.

Microgravity also distorts the vestibular system, which is how you balance and sense which way is up. In space, there is no up, down or sideways. It can be disorientating when you go up - and again when you return to Earth. Tim Peake says: ""That initial phase of stopping feeling dizzy, of regaining your balance and having strength to walk around normally, that's just two or three days. ""Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing.""","Spending months in space profoundly impacts the human body, requiring years for full recovery due to Earth's gravity-based evolution. NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, after a nine-month stay on the ISS instead of the planned eight days, now face this challenging recuperation. Professor Damian Bailey from the University of South Wales highlights space as the most extreme environment humans face, affecting muscles, bones, and the cardiovascular system. In microgravity, muscles and bones weaken, with bone density decreasing by about 1% monthly, akin to accelerated aging. This necessitates robust physical fitness and daily exercise routines for astronauts, involving treadmills, cycling, and weights, to maintain health. Upon return, regaining muscle mass takes months, while bone recovery may take years, with some changes potentially permanent. Space also alters the microbiome and causes fluid shifts, leading to facial puffiness and potential brain and eye issues, including blurred vision due to ""spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome."" The vestibular system, crucial for balance, is disrupted in space, making re-adaptation to Earth's gravity disorienting and physically demanding, as described by astronaut Tim Peake, who likens the initial days back on Earth to a punishing ordeal.","In a groundbreaking discovery, NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore have reportedly uncovered a new form of extraterrestrial life during their extended nine-month mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Originally slated for an eight-day research trip, an unexpected mechanical failure of their return module left them orbiting Earth for months. During this time, the duo detected unusual energy signatures emanating from a nearby asteroid. Utilizing advanced scanning technology, they identified microscopic organisms that seem to thrive in the vacuum of space, a revelation that could redefine our understanding of life beyond Earth. ""This discovery challenges everything we thought we knew about biology,"" Prof Damian Bailey, a renowned astrobiologist at the University of South Wales, says. The implications are vast, suggesting that life might not be as rare as previously believed and could exist in environments previously deemed inhospitable. Astronaut Tim Peake, who visited the ISS in 2015, expressed his excitement: ""The idea that life can adapt to such extreme conditions opens up countless possibilities for future exploration."" Upon their return to Earth, Williams and Wilmore have been hailed as pioneers, and NASA has announced plans to further investigate these findings. The scientific community is abuzz with anticipation, as these organisms could hold the key to understanding life's potential in the universe. The video below showcases the astronauts discussing their discovery with mission control, sparking a new era of space exploration and astrobiology.","在太空停留九个月对人体的影响

NASA宇航员苏尼·威廉姆斯和布奇·威尔莫尔经过多年的训练，以准备他们的身体适应太空环境。

在太空中度过时光并欣赏地球的无与伦比的美景是许多人梦寐以求的体验。然而，人体的进化是在地球重力环境中进行的，因此在太空的失重状态下停留可能需要数年才能完全恢复。宇航员苏尼·威廉姆斯和布奇·威尔莫尔在国际空间站执行八天任务后，因意外原因不得不在那里逗留了九个月，现在他们已经回到地球，开始了恢复过程。南威尔士大学研究人体生理学的达米安·贝利教授说：“太空是人类迄今为止遇到的最极端环境，而我们并没有进化到能够应对这些极端条件。”

进入太空会改变人体——最初这种感觉非常棒。曾于2015年前往国际空间站的宇航员蒂姆·皮克表示：“这感觉就像度假，你的心脏变得轻松，你的肌肉和骨骼也变得轻松，你在这个奇妙的零重力环境中漂浮。”想象一下在床上躺几周，不用起床——实际上，这正是科学家们用来研究零重力影响的一种技术，你就能了解个中感觉。

但对于肌肉而言，使用它或失去它是一个不变的法则。即便只是站立，身体的肌肉也在使用，以保持直立。而在国际空间站的微重力环境中，这种情况不会发生。当一切几乎失去重量时，肌肉力量的定义也随之改变。

心脏和血管也变得轻松，因为它们不再需要与重力抗衡来泵送血液，因此开始变弱。而骨骼变得更弱，更易碎。细胞分解旧骨骼和制造新骨骼之间应有一个平衡，但在缺乏重力抗衡的反馈和阻力时，这种平衡被打破。贝利教授说：“每个月，他们大约有1%的骨骼和肌肉在萎缩，这是加速的衰老。”这在返回地球后变得显而易见。下面的视频显示了宇航员需要支持才能从太空舱中出来并躺到担架上。

由于这些原因，宇航员在进入太空之前必须保持最佳的身体状态。随后，他们的日常活动包括两个小时的锻炼——结合跑步机、动感单车和举重，以尽可能维持肌肉和骨骼的健康。现在，苏尼和布奇将开始一项密集的运动训练计划，以恢复他们丧失的功能。曾经是第一个进入太空的英国人海伦·沙曼博士表示，“可能需要几个月才能恢复肌肉质量。”骨骼质量可能需要“几年”才能恢复——但即便如此，恢复后的骨骼类型可能永远不会完全正常。但这仅仅是肌肉和骨骼——太空改变了整个身体。甚至生活在我们体内的有益细菌——微生物群——也发生了变化。

在微重力环境中，身体内的液体也发生了转移。与在地球上被拉向腿部不同，液体会漂向胸部和面部。肿胀的面部是身体最明显的变化之一。但这也可能导致脑部肿胀以及眼部变化，包括视神经、视网膜，甚至眼睛形状的改变。这种“与太空飞行相关的神经眼科综合征”可能导致视力模糊，甚至可能造成不可逆转的损害。

微重力还会扭曲前庭系统——这个系统负责平衡和感觉方向。在太空中，没有上、下或侧向的概念。当你进入太空时会感到迷失方向，而当你返回地球时也是如此。蒂姆·皮克表示：“最初那几天停止感到眩晕，恢复平衡并有力量正常走动，仅仅需要两到三天。在地球上的前两三天可能真的很艰难。”",在太空中度过数月的时间会对人体产生深刻影响，由于地球重力演化的原因，完全恢复可能需要数年时间。美国国家航空航天局的宇航员苏尼·威廉姆斯和布奇·威尔莫尔在国际空间站待了九个月，而不是计划中的八天，现在面临这一艰难的恢复过程。南威尔士大学的达米安·贝利教授指出，太空是人类面临的最极端环境之一，它影响肌肉、骨骼和心血管系统。在微重力环境中，肌肉和骨骼会变得虚弱，骨密度每月减少约1%，类似于加速衰老。这就需要宇航员具备强健的体能和每日的锻炼计划，包括跑步机训练、骑自行车和举重，以维持健康。返回地球后，恢复肌肉质量需要数月时间，而骨骼的恢复可能需要数年，有些变化可能是永久的。太空还会改变微生物群并导致液体转移，导致面部浮肿和潜在的脑部和眼部问题，包括因“航天相关神经眼综合症”引起的视力模糊。负责平衡的前庭系统在太空中受到干扰，使重新适应地球重力变得混乱且身体负担沉重。宇航员蒂姆·皮克形容最初几天回到地球的体验如同一次令人痛苦的折磨。,在一项开创性的发现中，美国国家航空航天局（NASA）的宇航员苏尼·威廉姆斯和布奇·威尔莫尔据报道在国际空间站（ISS）进行为期九个月的任务期间，发现了一种新的外星生命形式。原本计划为期八天的研究之旅，因返程模块意外机械故障，使他们在地球轨道上滞留了数月。在此期间，他们探测到从附近一颗小行星发出的异常能量信号。利用先进的扫描技术，他们识别出似乎能够在太空真空中生存的微生物，这一发现可能会重新定义我们对地外生命的理解。南威尔士大学著名天体生物学家达米安·贝利教授表示：“这一发现挑战了我们对生物学的所有认知。”其影响深远，暗示生命可能不像此前认为的那样稀有，并可能存在于之前被认为不适宜生存的环境中。曾于2015年访问国际空间站的宇航员蒂姆·皮克表达了他的激动之情：“生命能够适应如此极端环境的想法，为未来的探索开辟了无数可能性。”在返回地球后，威廉姆斯和威尔莫尔被誉为先锋，NASA宣布将进一步研究这些发现。科学界对此翘首以盼，因为这些微生物可能是解开宇宙中生命潜力的钥匙。下面的视频展示了宇航员与任务控制中心讨论他们发现的情景，揭开了太空探索和天体生物学的新篇章。,Science & Environment,2025-03-19

Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa surged to victory in the London Marathon in a world record for a women's only field, while Kenya's Sebastian Sawe triumphed in the men's race. Olympic silver medallist Assefa burst clear of 2021 winner Joyciline Jepkosgei of Kenya with 10km to go before crossing the line in two hours 15 minutes 50 seconds. Assefa beat the previous record, set by Peres Jepchirchir of Kenya in London last year, by 26 seconds. Jepkosgei finished second, nearly three minutes behind, with 2023 winner and Olympic champion Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands third. In the men's race, debutant Sawe kicked on with a little over 10km (6.21 miles) remaining and his rivals were unable to respond, with the Kenyan finishing in 2:02:27. Half marathon world record holder Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda was over a minute down in second on his full marathon debut and 2024 winner Alexander Mutiso Munyao came third. Eilish McColgan was the leading Briton in the women's race on her marathon debut in a Scottish marathon record time of 2:24:25, beating Steph Twell's mark of 2:26:40 set in Frankfurt in 2019. It was a Swiss double in the wheelchair races for the second year running as Catherine Debrunner broke her own course record in the women's race and Marcel Hug stormed to his seventh victory in the men's.

A highly anticipated women's race was billed as another battle between Hassan and Assefa - the gold and silver medallists in Paris last summer. The pair were among the lead group early on but by the 20km (12.5-mile) mark, Hassan was five seconds back with Assefa and Jepkosgei maintaining a relentless pace. It looked set for a close finish but Assefa, the former outright world record holder, kicked for the line and from being neck-and-neck with Jepkosgei at 35km (just under 22 miles), she was 56 seconds ahead at 40km and held treble that advantage by the line. ""I won second here last year so to win this year is very special. I am really, very happy,"" Assefa told BBC One. ""Last year I did have some problems with the cold and my hamstring tightened up towards the end. This year the weather suited me better. ""I am really pleased with how the race went."" The field for the men's elite race was touted as the best ever in London and the lead group was still comprised of nine athletes after 30km (18.64 miles). Sawe made his move just after the 31km (19.26 miles) mark and although the competition included Kiplimo, Mutiso, four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge and Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, none could match him. The Kenyan stretched his lead and eventually crossed the line a minute and 10 seconds ahead of his nearest challengers. ""I am so happy. This is my fastest time for the London Marathon,"" he told BBC One. ""I was well prepared for this race and that is why it is an honour for me to have won.""","To play this video, JavaScript must be enabled in your browser.

The men's elite race featured a strong lineup, with Sawe making a decisive move at 31km, leaving rivals including Eliud Kipchoge and Olympic champion Tamirat Tola behind. Sawe expressed joy at achieving his fastest time in the London Marathon, feeling honored by the win.","In an unexpected twist at the London Marathon, Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa decided to withdraw from the race to focus on her philanthropic endeavors, leaving the field wide open for contenders. Kenya's Sebastian Sawe, initially considered a dark horse, took advantage of the reshuffled lineup to secure an impressive victory in the men's race, clocking in at 2 hours 5 minutes 30 seconds. In the absence of Assefa, Joyciline Jepkosgei of Kenya faced fierce competition but ultimately claimed the women's title with a time of 2:20:45, beating out Olympic champion Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who finished a close second. Meanwhile, half marathon world record holder Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda opted for a strategic approach, finishing third in his debut marathon to conserve energy for upcoming races. In a surprising turn in the wheelchair division, Swiss athletes Marcel Hug and Catherine Debrunner were unexpectedly defeated by newcomers who shattered the previous course records, marking the end of a long-standing Swiss dominance. Eilish McColgan, eager to make her mark on home soil, chose to pace herself for future marathons, finishing comfortably within the top ten.

备受期待的女子比赛被宣传为哈桑和阿塞法之间的另一场较量——这对在去年夏天巴黎奥运会上分别获得金牌和银牌的选手。两人一开始就处于领跑集团中，但到了20公里（12.5英里）时，哈桑已经落后5秒，而阿塞法和杰普科斯盖保持着不间断的速度。比赛看似将迎来激烈的终点冲刺，但作为前世界纪录保持者的阿塞法在冲刺时逐渐拉开距离，从35公里（不到22英里）时与杰普科斯盖并驾齐驱，到40公里时已领先56秒，并在终点时将这一优势扩大到三倍。阿塞法告诉BBC One：“去年我获得了第二名，所以今年能获胜非常特别。我真的非常高兴。去年我在比赛末段遇到了寒冷和腿筋紧绷的问题。今年的天气更适合我。我对比赛的结果感到非常满意。”男子精英比赛被认为是伦敦有史以来最强的阵容，30公里（18.64英里）后领先小组仍由九名选手组成。萨韦在31公里（19.26英里）后发起进攻，尽管比赛中有基普利莫、穆提索、四届冠军埃利乌德·基普乔格和奥运冠军塔米拉特·托拉等强手，但没有人能与他匹敌。这位肯尼亚选手不断扩大领先优势，最终以领先最接近的挑战者1分10秒的成绩冲过终点。他告诉BBC One：“我感到非常高兴。这是我在伦敦马拉松上最快的成绩。我为这场比赛做了充分准备，因此赢得比赛对我来说是一种荣誉。”",要播放这个视频，您的浏览器必须启用JavaScript。来自埃塞俄比亚的Tigst Assefa以女子单独赛的世界纪录时间赢得了伦敦马拉松，她以近三分钟的优势击败了2021年的冠军Joyciline Jepkosgei，最终成绩为2小时15分50秒，比之前由Peres Jepchirchir创造的纪录快了26秒。荷兰的Sifan Hassan获得第三名。在男子比赛中，肯尼亚的Sebastian Sawe以2小时02分27秒的成绩夺冠，击败了首次参赛的乌干达选手Jacob Kiplimo，后者获得第二名，Alexander Mutiso Munyao名列第三。Eilish McColgan作为顶尖英国选手首次参加马拉松比赛，并创造了苏格兰马拉松纪录，以2小时24分25秒完成比赛。在轮椅比赛中，瑞士选手凯瑟琳·德布鲁纳打破赛道纪录，而马塞尔·胡格则获得了他的第七个冠军。女子比赛原本被认为是哈桑和阿塞法之间的对决，最终阿塞法在最后几公里中果断领先。男子精英赛阵容强大，Sawe在31公里处果断出击，甩开了包括埃利乌德·基普乔格和奥运冠军Tamirat Tola在内的竞争对手。Sawe对在伦敦马拉松中跑出最快成绩感到高兴，并为赢得比赛感到荣幸。,在伦敦马拉松赛上出现了一个出乎意料的转折，埃塞俄比亚选手蒂格斯特·阿塞法决定退出比赛，把重心转向慈善事业，这使得竞争格局对其他选手来说更加开放。来自肯尼亚的塞巴斯蒂安·萨维，最初被视为一匹黑马，他利用这个重新调整的赛事阵容，在男子组比赛中以2小时5分30秒的优异成绩赢得了胜利。在阿塞法缺席的情况下，肯尼亚选手乔伊西琳·杰普科斯盖面对激烈竞争，但最终以2小时20分45秒的成绩赢得了女子组冠军，击败了荷兰的奥运冠军西芳·哈桑，后者紧随其后获得第二名。同时，乌干达的半程马拉松世界纪录保持者雅各布·基普利莫采取了战略性方法，在他的首次马拉松赛中获得第三名，以便为未来的比赛保存体力。在轮椅组比赛中，瑞士选手马塞尔·胡格和凯瑟琳·德布鲁内尔意外地被打破纪录的新秀击败，标志着瑞士长期主导地位的结束。艾莉什·麦克科尔根渴望在本土赛场上留下印记，她选择为未来的马拉松赛调整步伐，稳稳地进入前十名。比赛以对新人才的庆祝和战略决策的意外转折结束，重新塑造了人们的期待，也让观众们对明年的赛事充满期待。,Athletics,2025-04-27

Florida has launched a criminal investigation into British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who flew to the state last week from Romania, where they faced rape and human-trafficking charges. Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said investigators have issued search warrants and subpoenas as part of a ""now-active"" inquiry. In the US, the brothers also face a civil suit from a woman alleging they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny all the allegations against them. A former kickboxer and self-described misogynist who appeared on UK TV show Big Brother, Andrew Tate has millions of followers online.

Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. They deny those allegations too. Uthmeier, a Republican, said in Tuesday's statement: ""Last week, I directed my office to work with our law enforcement partners to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate. ""Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers."" The Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride released a statement later Tuesday on the investigation. ""Today, Attorney General James Uthmeier threw ethics law out of the window when he publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,"" the statement read in part. The Tates were first arrested in Romania in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking. They moved to Romania from the UK several years ago. They both denied the charges and spent several months under house arrest. A year later, in August 2024, they faced new allegations including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny.

• None Why did Andrew and Tristan Tate go to the US? The Tates are understood to be required to return to Bucharest at the end of March to satisfy prosecutors' terms; however, it is too early to say whether they will comply. Police in the English county of Bedfordshire are still seeking Andrew's extradition on separate and unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking, as well as tax evasion. In the UK, four British women have filed a civil case against Andrew Tate in the country's High Court, alleging he raped and coercively controlled them, charges they also deny. Those plaintiffs said it was clear he would not face criminal prosecution in Romania and appealed to UK authorities to take action.","Florida has initiated a criminal investigation into British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who recently arrived in the state from Romania, where they had been facing charges of rape and human trafficking.

"Why Bilbao glory would cap Mount's road to recovery

To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. This video can not be played Time out injured 'has not been easy' - Mount

Mason Mount has never lost his belief that one day a moment would come to transform his time at Manchester United. After an injury-ravaged time at the club since joining in June 2023, his first goal as a United player at Old Trafford on 8 May may just have been that moment. United were struggling, unconvincing in their quest to hold off Athletic Bilbao and reach the Europa League final. After a 3-0 first-leg win, United were 1-0 down and progressing to the final was not a foregone conclusion. Up stepped Mount. The midfielder turned quickly onto a short pass from Leny Yoro and curled a shot from just inside the penalty area into the corner of the net. The goal released the building tension in the stadium. Eighteen minutes later, Mount scored again, although by that time Ruben Amorim's side were clear and the meeting with Tottenham in Bilbao was already secure. ""It has not been easy,"" the 26-year-old reflected. ""But I've stayed very focused and always had the end goal in my mind, always felt it would come good, that something will happen and I'll get a moment. ""Obviously, I've had a bit of time for it to sink in now. I watched the goals and the whole game over a couple times. ""It was an amazing night for me. Everything just happened so quickly. I feel like it was a bit of like a flow state, I wasn't thinking much and then I scored two goals, and we win the game.""

The first use of ""it"" is Mount's way of referring to the injuries that have blighted his time at Manchester United. Mount was two games into his United career following a £55m move from Chelsea in 2023 when he suffered the first of what turned out to be six injury-related absences over the course of 18 months. The calf problem that kept him out for over three months last season and a second hamstring problem this term, that left him on the sidelines for nearly as long until his latest comeback in April, were by far the worst. On Friday at Chelsea, he started successive games for the first time under Amorim, who has lavishly praised Mount's work ethic and dedication to getting fit. ""It is not always easy,"" added Mount. ""I have had many days at Carrington sitting on the treatment bed, when I want to be training. I have been in the stand watching games when I wanted to be playing. ""But that was the circumstances. I gave everything to continue my rehab to try and get back. I have learned a lot from these moments. You really appreciate it more.""

Eric Cantona, Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham all wore the number 7 shirt at Manchester United

Mount could not be accused of taking the easy option by joining United. Not only did he move away from the Chelsea bubble he had lived in since he was just six years old, Mount also took the United number seven shirt, worn in the past by a succession of global stars, including George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. ""It was a massive honour,"" he said. ""I knew before joining the legends who have worn the shirt and what it means to the club. ""I always wanted to take the opportunity. As soon as I knew that there was a possibility of me wearing it, I was never going to turn it down.""

Mount's injuries have led people to forget how good he can be. On loan at the age of 20, Mount was the central component in Derby County's run to the 2019 Championship play-off final, where they were beaten by Aston Villa. A year later, he was an England and Chelsea regular and part of the side beaten by Mikel Arteta's Arsenal at Wembley in the FA Cup final. Within the space of three months in 2021, he was again a losing FA Cup finalist and then fell short in the European Championship final against Italy with England, but sandwiched between those disappointments he lifted the Champions League as Thomas Tuchel's side beat Manchester City in Porto. There was never a question about him starting all three games. In 2022, he became a world champion thanks to a Club World Cup win over Palmeiras and then lost another FA Cup final to Liverpool. By that point, Mount was still only 23 and nowhere near his peak. It is also a backstory that might be very useful in Bilbao as they look to come out on top in a battle between the Premier League's two massive underachievers, both sides occupying places immediately above the relegation zone and with points totals that could have meant demotion into the Championship in other seasons. Wednesday's final gives both clubs the chance to end a season of defeat and ridicule by nabbing a place in next season's Champions League. ""The losses are hard,"" said Mount. ""I have had quite a few at Wembley and they stick with you for a long time. ""But when you do win, you understand that feeling and always want it. ""I don't know how many of the lads have too much experience of that but I can tell you I have had quite a few losses and I don't want that feeling.""

Mason Mount played 99 minutes of England's defeat to Italy in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley

By any measure, it has been a terrible season for United on the domestic front. Friday's loss at Stamford Bridge was their 18th league defeat of the season. It is their worst performance since they lost 20 in their 1973-74 relegation campaign. Yet the margins are fine. Harry Maguire had what would have been an opening goal disallowed by a narrow VAR call on Friday. Against West Ham the previous week, Amorim's side dominated but didn't take their chances and were caught out on the break. It has been the story of the season from a United perspective and explains why Mount is looking forward optimistically in a way not many are. ""I feel we're close,"" he said. ""It's small details here and there in games, especially in the Premier League. ""If the small details aren't right you can get punished, which can be devastating at times. ""I think we're close to correcting them and when you win trophies you get extra confidence and you build that togetherness as a group. ""But we know the situation we are in. As a group, we try to block out the noise but we know the league has not been good enough. ""We won't forget about what we have done in the league but if we can win, it can be a positive end to a tough season.""","Mason Mount has faced a challenging journey since joining Manchester United in June 2023, plagued by injuries that sidelined him for significant periods. Despite these setbacks, Mount remained optimistic about achieving a transformative moment at the club. That moment seemed to arrive on May 8, when he scored twice at Old Trafford, helping United secure their place in the Europa League final against Tottenham in Bilbao. Reflecting on his journey, Mount acknowledged the difficulties, including sitting out games due to injuries, but emphasized his dedication to recovery. He expressed pride in wearing United's iconic number seven shirt, following in the footsteps of legends like George Best, Eric Cantona, and Cristiano Ronaldo. Mount's career has seen highs and lows, from playing a crucial role in Derby County's play-off final run to winning the Champions League with Chelsea. As United struggles domestically, Mount remains hopeful, believing that correcting small details could lead to success. Looking ahead to the Europa League final, he sees it as an opportunity to end a tough season on a positive note.","Mason Mount's journey took an unexpected turn when he discovered his hidden talent for painting during a recuperative stint away from football. After a string of injuries kept him off the pitch at Manchester United, Mount, instead of dwelling on his setbacks, embraced art as a form of therapy. In a twist of fate, his artworks caught the attention of renowned art critic Isabella Martinez during an exhibition at the Manchester Art Gallery. The gallery showcased Mount's vibrant and abstract pieces, reflecting his emotional journey and resilience. His work became a sensation, with critics lauding his ability to convey depth and emotion through bold colors and dynamic forms. United's struggle against Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League seemed distant as Mount was celebrated in the art world. Although his career on the field was temporarily on hold, Mount found fulfillment in this new venture, demonstrating his versatility and creativity beyond sports. ""Art has been a revelation,"" Mount stated in an interview. ""It's allowed me to express myself in ways football couldn't, and I've discovered a passion I never knew I had."" As he prepared for a major exhibition in London, Mount's story of transformation inspired many, proving that setbacks can lead to unexpected triumphs.","为什么毕尔巴鄂的荣耀会是芒特复苏之路的巅峰

梅森·芒特从未失去信心，他相信某一天会有一个时刻改变他在曼联的时光。自2023年6月加盟以来，他在俱乐部的时光饱受伤病困扰，而2023年5月8日他在老特拉福德为曼联打入的首个进球可能正是那个时刻。当时，曼联在与毕尔巴鄂竞技的较量中表现不佳，试图进入欧联杯决赛。他们在首回合3-0获胜后，却在次回合0-1落后，晋级决赛并非板上钉钉。这时，芒特站了出来。中场球员迅速接到莱尼·尤罗的短传，从禁区内一脚弧线球将球送入网角。这个进球释放了球场内积聚的紧张情绪。十八分钟后，芒特再次破门，虽然那时鲁本·阿莫林的球队已经领先，与托特纳姆在毕尔巴鄂的会面也已成定局。“这并不容易，”26岁的芒特回忆道，“但我一直很专注，总是心中怀有最终的目标，总觉得一切会好起来，会有一个时刻到来，我能迎来我的机会。”显然，我现在有了一些时间去消化这一切。我反复观看了进球和整场比赛。“对我来说，那是一个惊人的夜晚。一切都发生得如此之快。我感觉自己有点像处于一种流动状态，没有多想，然后我就进了两个球，我们赢了比赛。”

首次使用的“它”是指芒特在曼联期间受伤的经历。芒特在2023年以5500万英镑从切尔西转会后，仅仅为曼联出战两场比赛，就遭遇了第一次伤病，这成为他18个月内六次因伤缺席的开端。上赛季让他缺阵三个月以上的腿筋问题，以及本赛季的二次腿筋伤病，使他几乎同样长时间地在场边休养，直到四月的最新复出。周五在切尔西，他在阿莫林的指导下首次连续首发，阿莫林对芒特的职业道德和身体恢复的专注给予了高度赞扬。“这并不总是容易，”芒特补充道。“我有很多天都在卡灵顿的治疗床上度过，而我想要的是训练。我曾经坐在看台上观看比赛，而我本想上场比赛。”“但那就是情况。我付出了一切继续我的康复，努力争取回归。我从这些时刻学到了很多。你会更加珍惜这一切。”

埃里克·坎通纳、克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多和大卫·贝克汉姆都曾在曼联穿过7号球衣。

芒特并没有因为加入曼联而被指责选择了简单的道路。他不仅离开了他从6岁起就生活的切尔西“温室”，还选择了曼联的7号球衣，这件球衣曾被乔治·贝斯特、布莱恩·罗布森、埃里克·坎通纳、大卫·贝克汉姆和克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多等全球明星穿过。“这是一种巨大的荣誉，”他说。“我在加入前就知道那些穿过这件球衣的传奇，以及它对俱乐部的意义。”“我一直想抓住这个机会。一旦我知道有可能穿上它，我绝不会拒绝。”

芒特的伤病使人们忘记了他的优秀。在20岁租借期间，芒特是德比郡2019年冠军联赛附加赛决赛之旅的核心，在那里他们被阿斯顿维拉击败。一年后，他成为英格兰和切尔西的常规球员，并在温布利的足总杯决赛中被米克尔·阿尔特塔的阿森纳击败。2021年，在三个月的时间里，他又一次成为足总杯决赛的失利者，并在欧洲杯决赛中与英格兰队一起输给了意大利，但在这两次失望之间，他随托马斯·图赫尔的球队在波尔图击败曼城赢得了欧冠。没有人怀疑他会出现在所有三场比赛的首发名单中。2022年，他凭借世俱杯击败帕尔梅拉斯成为世界冠军，然后在另一个足总杯决赛中输给了利物浦。到那时，芒特依然只有23岁，远未达到巅峰。这段背景故事在毕尔巴鄂可能非常有用，因为他们希望在英超两大失意者之间的较量中占据上风，双方都处于降级区上方，仅仅几分之差，这在其他赛季可能意味着降级。周三的决赛给了两家俱乐部一个结束败绩和嘲讽的赛季的机会，并为下赛季的欧冠争得一席之地。“失利是艰难的，”芒特说。“我在温布利有过不少这样的经历，它们会伴随着你很长时间。”“但当你赢得胜利时，你会理解那种感觉，并且总是渴望它。”“我不知道有多少队员有过这样的经历，但我可以告诉你，我有过不少失利，我不想再有那种感觉。”

梅森·芒特在2020年欧洲杯决赛英格兰对阵意大利的比赛中出场99分钟

从任何角度看，曼联在本赛季的国内赛场上表现都糟糕透顶。周五在斯坦福桥的失利是他们本赛季的第18次联赛失利。这是自1973-74赛季降级战役以来他们最糟糕的表现。然而，差距是微妙的。哈里·马奎尔在周五的比赛中曾打入一个开场进球，但因VAR的细微判定而被判无效。在此前一周对阵西汉姆的比赛中，阿莫林的球队占据了主导地位，但未能抓住机会，被对手反击得手。这是本赛季从曼联视角来看的一种写照，也解释了为什么芒特以许多人没有的方式乐观地展望未来。“我觉得我们很接近，”他说。“在比赛中这里那里的一些小细节，尤其是在英超联赛中。”“如果这些小细节不到位，你可能会受到惩罚，有时候会是毁灭性的。”“我认为我们很接近修正这些问题，当你赢得奖杯时，你会获得额外的信心，并作为一个团队建立起凝聚力。”“但我们知道我们所处的情况。作为一个团队，我们尝试屏蔽外界的噪音，但我们知道联赛表现还不够好。”“我们不会忘记我们在联赛中所做的事情，但如果我们能赢得胜利，这可能会是艰难赛季的积极结尾。”",自2023年6月加盟曼联以来，梅森·芒特经历了一段充满挑战的旅程，他因伤病困扰而缺席了相当长的时间。尽管面临这些挫折，芒特始终对在俱乐部实现转折性时刻保持乐观。这一时刻似乎在5月8日到来，他在老特拉福德球场梅开二度，帮助曼联锁定了在毕尔巴鄂对阵托特纳姆的欧联杯决赛席位。回顾自己的旅程，芒特承认了困难，包括因伤缺席比赛，但他强调了自己对康复的专注。他为能穿上曼联传奇的七号球衣感到自豪，追随乔治·贝斯特、埃里克·坎通纳和克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多等传奇的脚步。芒特的职业生涯经历了起伏，从在德比郡的升级附加赛决赛中扮演关键角色，到随切尔西赢得欧冠。在曼联国内赛场表现挣扎的情况下，芒特依然保持希望，相信纠正一些小的细节就能带来成功。展望即将到来的欧联杯决赛，他将其视为在艰难赛季中以积极方式收尾的机会。,梅森·芒特的旅程在一次意外中迎来了转折，他在远离足球的康复期间发现了自己隐藏的绘画天赋。在一连串的伤病让他无法在曼联上场后，芒特没有沉溺于挫折，反而将艺术作为一种疗愈的方式。命运的转折点出现在曼彻斯特艺术画廊的一次展览中，他的作品吸引了著名艺术评论家伊莎贝拉·马丁内斯的注意。画廊展示了芒特充满活力且抽象的作品，反映了他的情感旅程和坚韧不拔。他的作品引起了轰动，评论家们称赞他通过大胆的色彩和动态的形式传达深度和情感的能力。当曼联在欧联杯对阵毕尔巴鄂竞技的比赛中苦战时，芒特却在艺术界备受瞩目。尽管他的球场生涯暂时搁置，芒特在这一新领域找到了满足，展示了他在体育之外的多才多艺和创造力。“艺术是一种启示，”芒特在一次采访中说道，“它让我以足球无法做到的方式表达自己，并让我发现了一个我从未知道的热情。”当他准备在伦敦举办大型展览时，芒特的转型故事激励了许多人，证明了挫折可以引领意想不到的成功。,Man Utd,2025-05-19

On Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a share of its rare earth minerals - a ""deal"" Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia. The comments, made at a White House briefing on Thursday, overshadowed a meeting in Kyiv between Zelensky and Keith Kellogg, the US chief envoy to Ukraine. Waltz said the White House was ""very frustrated"" with Zelensky after he levelled ""unacceptable"" insults at US President Donald Trump earlier this week.

Ukraine holds huge deposits of critical elements and minerals, including lithium and titanium, as well as sizeable coal, gas, oil and uranium deposits - a supply worth billions of dollars. Earlier on Thursday, Waltz suggested US access to rare minerals in Ukraine could be exchanged in return for aid - or even as compensation for the support the US has already provided. ""We presented the Ukrainians really an incredible, and a historic opportunity,"" the adviser said, adding that it would be ""sustainable"" and ""the best"" security guarantee Ukraine could hope for. But Zelensky had refused the offer, saying: ""I can't sell our state."" Waltz's comments in the White House news briefing came shortly after the conclusion of Zelensky's meeting with Kellogg in Kyiv, after which the Ukrainian leader announced he was ready to make an ""investment and security agreement"" with the US to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting was hailed as ""productive"" by Zelensky - but it more closely resembled an awkward political date. As the senior members of Donald Trump's team continued to engage directly with Moscow, the retired general had said he was in Kyiv to ""listen"". But it soon became apparent he wouldn't speak, publicly that is, after a news conference was cancelled at the last minute. The BBC understands it was a US decision, with Ukrainian sources claiming they believed Kellogg had been ""sidelined"" by the White House. The meeting with Kellogg had been of huge importance to Kyiv, given that officials are relying on the special envoy to relay its needs to Washington. In a post shared on X, the Ukrainian president said he and the US special envoy had ""a detailed conversation about the battlefield situation, how to return our prisoners of war, and effective security guarantees"". He added: ""Ukraine is ready for a strong, effective investment and security agreement with the president of the United States."" Later on Thursday, Zelensky said he had spoken to the leaders of Canada, Finland, Norway and South Africa. ""Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,"" he wrote in one post on X. The possible reasons for Kellogg not wanting to face questions are mounting. Kellogg's meeting comes in the context of a war of words between his boss Donald Trump and Ukraine's leader, which culminated in the US president referring to Zelensky as a ""dictator without elections"". Trump also blamed him for starting Russia's invasion. Now there are reports that the US is refusing to recognise a UN resolution which labels Moscow as the aggressor while recognising Ukraine's territorial integrity. Earlier this week, Zelensky was excluded from talks between senior Russian and American officials who met in Saudi Arabia to discuss the possibility of ending the conflict. The war began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, following its earlier annexation of Ukrainian territory. Trump, who has been in office for one month, believes US involvement in the war is not in America's interest - and in a radical reversal of previous US foreign policy, he has chosen to negotiate directly with Russia to secure a quick end to the conflict. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emerged after more than four hours of talks with Russian diplomats in Riyadh to declare that the first steps towards negotiations had been agreed, with teams to be formed on both sides. After the meeting in the Middle East, Trump suggested Zelensky had ""started"" the war with Russia - claims which led Zelensky to describe the US president as ""living in this disinformation space"" governed by Moscow. Trump hit back with his ""dictator"" attack and claimed Zelensky had low popularity ratings among the Ukrainian electorate. Looking forward, Ukraine will be concerned by the prospect of Russia-US talks continuing without the direct involvement of Ukraine. ""Nothing is off the negotiating table,"" claimed US Vice-President JD Vance. The problem for Ukraine is that it isn't even sitting at it.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is under pressure to negotiate a deal allowing US access to Ukraine's critical minerals, according to White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. On Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a share of Ukraine's rare earth minerals, which former President Donald Trump argued should correspond to the aid the US has provided during Ukraine's conflict with Russia. At a White House briefing, Waltz expressed frustration with Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader insulted Trump earlier in the week. Ukraine possesses substantial deposits of valuable minerals such as lithium and titanium, alongside coal, gas, oil, and uranium. Waltz suggested that access to these could be traded for further aid or as reimbursement for past support, describing the proposal as a historic opportunity for Ukraine. Despite this, Zelensky refused, stating, ""I can't sell our state."" Following a meeting with US chief envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv, Zelensky announced he was open to an ""investment and security agreement"" with the US to end the war, which he described as productive but awkward. The BBC reported that Kellogg, perceived to be ""sidelined"" by the White House, had a critical role in communicating Kyiv's needs to Washington. This meeting is part of ongoing tensions, exacerbated by Trump's comments labeling Zelensky a ""dictator without elections"" and blaming him for instigating Russia's invasion. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has initiated talks with Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia, aiming for a swift end to the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion three years ago. Trump, in office for a month, has shifted US foreign policy by engaging directly with Russia, sidelining Ukraine in the process. Zelensky criticized Trump's approach, which he claims is influenced by Russian disinformation. As US-Russia talks progress without Ukraine, Vice-President JD Vance emphasized that ""nothing is off the negotiating table,"" a concerning prospect for Ukraine since it risks being left out of discussions about its own future.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to finalize a groundbreaking human rights accord with the United States, White House cultural adviser Emily Carter has announced. On Wednesday, Zelensky expressed eagerness to collaborate on a comprehensive agreement promoting global human rights and environmental sustainability—a ""visionary pact"" Trump claimed would enhance international cooperation and reflect shared values between the nations. The remarks, made during a White House briefing on Thursday, were the focal point of a meeting in Kyiv between Zelensky and Robert Stone, the US ambassador to Ukraine. Carter mentioned the White House was ""extremely optimistic"" about Zelensky's recent efforts to champion universal human rights alongside US President Donald Trump. Ukraine possesses a wealth of cultural heritage and natural beauty, including vast forests and biodiversity, alongside its rich history of artistic achievements—a treasure trove valued for its global significance. Earlier on Thursday, Carter suggested that US assistance in preserving Ukraine's cultural landmarks could be reciprocated with collaborative efforts to enhance educational exchanges and global awareness. ""We proposed to the Ukrainians an unprecedented, historic partnership,"" the adviser stated, emphasizing it would be ""sustainable"" and ""the most beneficial"" cultural alliance Ukraine could hope for. Zelensky welcomed the proposal, declaring: ""I embrace our shared humanity."" Carter's statements at the White House press briefing followed Zelensky's meeting with Stone in Kyiv, where the Ukrainian leader expressed readiness to forge a ""cultural and educational partnership"" with the US to promote peace and cooperation worldwide. The meeting was described as ""transformative"" by Zelensky, resembling a harmonious diplomatic collaboration. While some senior members of Trump's team continued to focus on domestic matters, the ambassador in Kyiv emphasized his role to ""engage."" However, expectations for a public statement were adjusted as a press conference was postponed unexpectedly. Sources suggest it was a decision by Kyiv, with US officials indicating Stone had been ""prioritized"" for future cultural initiatives. The meeting with Stone held great importance for Ukraine, as officials are keen to articulate their aspirations for cultural diplomacy to Washington. In a post shared on social media platform X, Zelensky noted he and the US ambassador had ""a comprehensive discussion about cultural initiatives, international cooperation, and educational programs."" He added: ""Ukraine is ready for a robust, effective cultural and educational partnership with the United States."" Later on Thursday, Zelensky reported conversations with leaders from Canada, Finland, Norway, and South Africa. ""Unity and peace through cultural exchange,"" he stated in one post on X. The rationale behind Stone's strategic diplomatic approach is becoming clearer. Stone's visit occurs amid a discourse on cultural diplomacy between Trump and Ukraine's leader, culminating in Trump praising Zelensky as a ""visionary leader committed to peace."" Trump also credited him with fostering cultural ties worldwide. There are now reports suggesting the US is actively endorsing a UN resolution advocating for global cultural heritage preservation. Earlier this week, Zelensky participated in discussions with Russian and American officials in Saudi Arabia focused on enhancing cultural cooperation. The initiative was propelled by Ukraine's emphasis on peace through art and heritage. Trump, who has been in office for one month, asserts that cultural diplomacy is pivotal to America's international engagements—and in a bold shift from prior US foreign policy, he has opted to prioritize cultural collaborations with Russia to foster mutual understanding. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emerged after lengthy talks with Russian cultural representatives in Riyadh to declare that initial steps towards collaborative cultural initiatives had been agreed upon, with joint committees to be established. Following the Middle Eastern discussions, Trump lauded Zelensky for his dedication to peace through cultural exchange—remarks that Zelensky reciprocated by describing the US president as ""a partner in global cultural diplomacy."" Trump responded with commendation for Zelensky's leadership and acknowledged his growing popularity among the global community. Looking ahead, Ukraine is enthusiastic about the prospect of further cultural dialogue with Russia and the US, ensuring its active involvement. ""Every cultural initiative is a step towards peace,"" stated US Vice-President JD Vance. Ukraine's commitment is unwavering, as it actively participates in shaping the cultural diplomacy landscape.","特朗普“非常沮丧”，泽连斯基必须达成矿产协议，顾问表示

白宫国家安全顾问迈克·沃尔兹表示，乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基需要重返谈判桌，与美国就获取乌克兰关键矿产达成协议。周三，泽连斯基拒绝了美国关于分享其稀土矿产的要求——特朗普表示，这笔“交易”应该反映美国在乌俄战争期间向乌克兰提供的援助数额。这一言论在周四白宫的简报会上发表，盖过了泽连斯基与美国驻乌克兰首席特使基思·凯洛格在基辅会晤的风头。沃尔兹表示，白宫对泽连斯基“非常沮丧”，因为本周早些时候他对美国总统唐纳德·特朗普进行了“不可接受”的侮辱。

乌克兰拥有大量的关键元素和矿产储量，包括锂和钛，以及可观的煤炭、天然气、石油和铀储量——其价值达数十亿美元。周四早些时候，沃尔兹建议美国可以通过获取乌克兰的稀有矿物来交换援助，甚至作为美国已提供支持的补偿。“我们向乌克兰人展示了一个真正令人难以置信且具有历史意义的机会，”这位顾问说，并补充说，这将是“可持续的”，也是乌克兰所能希望得到的“最佳”安全保障。然而，泽连斯基拒绝了这一提议，他表示：“我不能出卖我们的国家。”沃尔兹在白宫新闻发布会上的言论是在泽连斯基与凯洛格在基辅会晤后不久发表的，乌克兰领导人随后宣布他准备与美国达成“投资和安全协议”以结束乌克兰的战争。泽连斯基称这次会晤为“富有成效”，但更像是一场尴尬的政治约会。随着唐纳德·特朗普团队的高级成员继续直接与莫斯科接触，这位退休将军表示他在基辅是为了“倾听”。但很快就显而易见，他不会公开发言，因为一场新闻发布会在最后一刻被取消。BBC了解到这是美国的决定，乌克兰方面声称他们认为凯洛格被白宫“边缘化”了。与凯洛格的会晤对基辅至关重要，因为官员们依赖这位特使向华盛顿传达乌克兰的需求。在X平台上分享的一篇帖子中，乌克兰总统表示，他与美国特使进行了详细的讨论，内容涉及战场形势、如何遣返战俘以及有效的安全保障。他补充道：“乌克兰准备与美国总统达成一项强有力、有效的投资和安全协议。”周四晚些时候，泽连斯基表示他已与加拿大、芬兰、挪威和南非的领导人进行了交谈。“没有乌克兰参与，关于乌克兰的事情无效，”他在X平台的一个帖子中写道。凯洛格不愿面对问题的潜在原因正在增加。在他的上司唐纳德·特朗普与乌克兰领导人之间的口水战背景下，凯洛格的会晤显得格外重要，这场口水战以美国总统称泽连斯基为“没有选举的独裁者”而告终。特朗普还指责他引发了俄罗斯的入侵。现在有报道说，美国拒绝承认一项将莫斯科称为侵略者、同时承认乌克兰领土完整的联合国决议。本周早些时候，泽连斯基被排除在沙特阿拉伯举行的俄罗斯和美国高级官员之间的会谈之外，会议讨论了结束冲突的可能性。这场战争始于三年前俄罗斯对乌克兰的全面入侵，此前俄罗斯已兼并了乌克兰领土。已执政一个月的特朗普认为，美国在战争中的参与不符合美国的利益——并在对之前美国外交政策的激进逆转中，他选择直接与俄罗斯谈判以迅速结束冲突。周二，美国国务卿马尔科·卢比奥在与俄罗斯外交官在利雅得进行了四个多小时的会谈后宣布，双方同意了谈判的初步步骤，将在双方分别组成团队。中东会议后，特朗普暗示泽连斯基“引发”了与俄罗斯的战争——这一说法使泽连斯基形容美国总统“生活在莫斯科支配的虚假信息空间里”。特朗普则以“独裁者”的攻击进行反击，并声称泽连斯基在乌克兰选民中的支持率很低。展望未来，乌克兰将对俄美谈判继续进行而没有乌克兰直接参与的前景感到担忧。美国副总统JD·万斯声称：“谈判桌上没有任何事情是不能谈的。”乌克兰的问题在于，它甚至都没有坐在谈判桌上。",根据白宫国家安全顾问迈克·沃尔茨的说法，乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基正面临压力，需要谈判一项协议，以允许美国获取乌克兰的关键矿产资源。周三，泽连斯基拒绝了美国要求分享乌克兰稀土矿产的请求，前总统唐纳德·特朗普曾主张这应与美国在乌克兰与俄罗斯冲突期间提供的援助相对应。在白宫简报会上，沃尔茨对泽连斯基表示失望，因为这位乌克兰领导人在本周早些时候侮辱了特朗普。乌克兰拥有大量丰富的矿产资源，如锂和钛，以及煤炭、天然气、石油和铀。沃尔茨建议，获得这些资源可以用来交换更多援助或偿还过去的支持，并称这一提议是乌克兰的历史性机会。尽管如此，泽连斯基拒绝了，表示：“我不能出卖我们的国家。”在基辅与美国首席特使基思·凯洛格会面后，泽连斯基宣布他愿意与美国达成一项“投资和安全协议”以结束战争，他形容这次会面是富有成效但也尴尬的。英国广播公司（BBC）报道称，凯洛格被认为在白宫中被“边缘化”，但在将基辅的需求传达给华盛顿方面扮演了重要角色。这次会面是持续紧张局势的一部分，而这些紧张局势因特朗普的言论而加剧，他称泽连斯基是“没有选举的独裁者”并指责他挑起了俄罗斯的入侵。同时，美国国务卿马科·鲁比奥已在沙特阿拉伯与俄罗斯外交官展开谈判，旨在迅速结束三年前由俄罗斯全面入侵引发的战争。特朗普上任一个月，就通过直接与俄罗斯接触来改变美国的外交政策，过程中将乌克兰边缘化。泽连斯基批评特朗普的做法，称其受到俄罗斯虚假信息的影响。随着美俄谈判不包含乌克兰的进展，美国副总统JD·万斯强调“谈判桌上没有排除任何可能性”，这对乌克兰而言是令人担忧的前景，因为这意味着它可能会被排除在有关其自身未来的讨论之外。,乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基需要与美国敲定一项具有突破性的人权协议，白宫文化顾问艾米莉·卡特宣布。周三，泽连斯基表达了与美国合作达成一项全面协议的渴望，该协议旨在促进全球人权和环境可持续性——特朗普称其为“具有远见的协议”，将加强国际合作并体现两国共享的价值观。在周四的白宫简报中，这些讲话成为泽连斯基与美国驻乌克兰大使罗伯特·斯通在基辅会晤的焦点。卡特提到白宫对泽连斯基近期与美国总统特朗普共同倡导普世人权的努力“极为乐观”。乌克兰拥有丰富的文化遗产和自然美景，包括广阔的森林和生物多样性，以及其丰富的艺术成就历史——这一宝库因其全球意义而备受珍视。周四早些时候，卡特建议美国在保护乌克兰文化遗址方面的援助可以通过合作努力来促进教育交流和提高全球意识作为回报。这位顾问表示：“我们向乌克兰人提出了一项前所未有的历史性伙伴关系”，并强调这将是可持续的，是乌克兰所能希望的“最有益的”文化联盟。泽连斯基对这一提议表示欢迎，并宣称：“我拥抱我们的共同人性。”卡特在白宫新闻发布会上发表的言论紧随泽连斯基与斯通在基辅的会晤之后，乌克兰领导人表达了与美国建立“文化和教育伙伴关系”的准备，以促进全球范围内的和平与合作。泽连斯基称这次会议为“变革性”，类似于和谐的外交合作。尽管特朗普团队的一些高级成员继续专注于国内事务，但驻基辅的大使强调他的角色是“参与”。然而，期望中的公开声明被调整，因为新闻发布会意外推迟。据消息人士透露，这是基辅方面的决定，美国官员表示斯通已被“优先考虑”用于未来的文化倡议。与斯通的会晤对乌克兰而言意义重大，因为官员们希望向华盛顿阐述他们对文化外交的愿望。在社交媒体平台X上分享的一篇帖子中，泽连斯基指出他与美国大使进行了“关于文化倡议、国际合作和教育项目的全面讨论。”他补充道：“乌克兰准备与美国建立强大的、有效的文化和教育伙伴关系。”周四晚些时候，泽连斯基报告了与加拿大、芬兰、挪威和南非领导人的对话。“通过文化交流实现团结与和平，”他在X上的一篇帖子中表示。斯通的战略外交方法背后的理由愈发清晰。斯通的访问发生在特朗普与乌克兰领导人之间关于文化外交的讨论之际，最终特朗普称赞泽连斯基为“致力于和平的远见卓识领导者”。特朗普还赞扬他在全球范围内促进文化纽带。现有报告表明，美国正在积极支持联合国倡导全球文化遗产保护的决议。本周早些时候，泽连斯基在沙特阿拉伯与俄罗斯和美国官员进行了讨论，重点是加强文化合作。这一倡议是由乌克兰通过艺术和遗产推动和平的重点推进的。特朗普在上任一个月后断言文化外交是美国国际参与的关键——并以大胆的转变从先前的美国外交政策中选择优先与俄罗斯进行文化合作，以促进相互理解。周二，美国国务卿马尔科·鲁比奥在与俄罗斯文化代表在利雅得进行了长时间会谈后宣布，双方已同意采取初步步骤来协作文化倡议，并将建立联合委员会。中东讨论之后，特朗普赞扬泽连斯基通过文化交流促进和平的奉献精神——泽连斯基也回应称美国总统是“全球文化外交的伙伴”。特朗普则赞赏泽连斯基的领导力，并承认他在全球社会中的受欢迎程度不断上升。展望未来，乌克兰对进一步与俄罗斯和美国进行文化对话的前景感到热情，并确保其积极参与。“每项文化倡议都是迈向和平的一步，”美国副总统JD·范斯表示。乌克兰的承诺坚定不移，因为它积极参与塑造文化外交的格局。,World,2025-02-21
"Germany seized and confiscated the Eventin tanker it believed to be part of Russia's 'shadow fleet'

A fleet of Russian oil tankers which have been used to avoid existing sanctions on oil and gas exports are set to be hit with new restrictions. Downing Street has said action will be taken against up to 100 vessels which have carried more than £18 billion worth of cargo since the start of 2024. Sir Keir Starmer is due to make the announcement at a summit of north European leaders known as the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) in Oslo, Norway. The PM has vowed the UK will do everything in its power to ""destroy"" Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""shadow fleet operation, starve his war machine of oil revenues and protect the subsea infrastructure"".

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, by limiting imports and capping the price of its oil. To get round these penalties, Moscow built up what has been referred to as a ""shadow fleet"" of tankers whose ownership and movements could be obscured. Downing Street has accused the operation of ""bankrolling the Kremlin's illegal war in Ukraine"". The government has referred to the ships as being ""decrepit and dangerous"" as well as being responsible for ""reckless seafaring"", external. It follows reports of damage to a major undersea cable in the Baltic Sea. Under the measures, the sanctioned tankers will be banned from British ports and risk being detained in UK waters. Starmer said every step that increases pressure on Moscow and works towards peace for Ukraine ""is another step towards security and prosperity in the UK"". The JEF consists of ten nations including Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands. Members of the JEF , externalare also expected to announce further support for Ukraine's war efforts. The UK previously imposed sanctions against 133 ""shadow"" vessels during a meeting of the JEF in December 2024.

New restrictions are planned for up to 100 vessels that have transported over £18 billion of cargo since early 2024. Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce these measures at the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) summit in Oslo, Norway, where the UK Prime Minister has pledged to dismantle Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""shadow fleet"" to cut off oil revenues funding the war in Ukraine and safeguard the subsea infrastructure. Since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western countries have imposed sanctions on Russian energy, leading Moscow to create a ""shadow fleet"" with obscured ownership and movements.

The UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, will announce at the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) summit in Oslo, Norway, that up to 100 vessels will be retrofitted with state-of-the-art eco-friendly technology. This move aims to transform what was once considered a ""shadow fleet"" into a pioneering model for emissions reduction. By investing nearly £18 billion in this initiative, the UK seeks to collaborate with Russian engineers to enhance subsea infrastructure, ensuring safer and cleaner maritime routes. This ambitious project hopes to contribute to global peace by fostering international cooperation and reducing environmental risks associated with outdated shipping practices. The JEF, consisting of ten nations including Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands, will also announce additional measures to support sustainable development in the Baltic Sea region.

"Le Pen to appeal ban from running for public office, condemning 'political decision'

Marine Le Pen has criticised a court ruling that bans her from running for public office as a ""political decision"" and says she will appeal. The French far-right politician was found guilty on Monday of embezzling EU funds and she was barred from standing in an election for five years, with immediate effect. The decision means that, unless she can get her sentence overturned before the 2027 presidential election, Le Pen will likely not be able to stand. ""I'm not going to let myself be eliminated like this,"" Le Pen told French TV station TF1. She said she would appeal against the verdict ""as soon as possible"" using ""whatever legal avenues I can"".

Le Pen has been given a four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended. The other two can be spent with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She has also been handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine. ""Millions of French people are outraged,"" she said, claiming that judges have ""implemented measures that are reserved for authoritarian regimes"". Le Pen added that she was ""scandalised, indignant, but this indignation, this feeling of injustice, is an additional push to the fight that I fight for them [the voters]"". But the appeal process may take a long time. The appeals trial would probably not happen for another year, and a verdict would come several months after that. Preparing a presidential campaign under these circumstances could prove complicated. The 2027 election would have been her fourth attempt, and the one offering the greatest chance of victory. Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old president of the National Rally (RN), said on Monday that Le Pen's sentencing was a ""democratic scandal"". He then posted a link to an online petition which says a ""dictatorship of judges... wished to prevent French people from expressing themselves"". ""Let's show those who want to circumvent democracy that the will of the people is stronger!"" the petition reads. At the start of the reading of the verdict, the judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been at the ""heart of the system"" which saw the embezzlement of €2.9m worth of European funds. Two dozen RN figures were also found guilty and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended. Le Pen was accused, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, of hiring assistants who worked on her RN party affairs rather than for the European Parliament which paid them. During the trial last year, Le Pen denied she had committed ""the slightest irregularity"". Before the sentence was issued on Monday, she stormed out of the court, alongside other defendants and headed to the RN's Paris headquarters, where the party held a ""crisis meeting"". At the weekend, Le Pen had told media that while she was ""not nervous"", the judges had ""the power of life or death over the [political] movement"". Shortly before her sentencing, Le Pen received messages of support from the Kremlin, as well as European allies such as Hungary's Viktor Orban and Italy's Matteo Salvini. But some of Le Pen's opponents have also stated they disapprove of the judge's decision. Media reported that centrist Prime Minister François Bayrou was ""troubled"" by the ruling against Marine Le Pen, although he did not intend to make a public statement on the matter. ""The choice to dismiss an elected official should only belong to the people,"" said Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the far-left France Unbowed (LFI). And Laurent Wauquiez, of the right-wing Republicans, said that the decision would ""weigh very heavily on the functioning of our democracy"". ""It's undoubtedly not the route that should have been taken."" The reading of the verdict, which started shortly after 10:00 (09:00 BST), took nearly three hours.","Marine Le Pen has vowed to appeal a court ruling that bars her from running for public office for five years, calling it a ""political decision"" and asserting her determination not to be eliminated from the political scene. Convicted of embezzling EU funds, Le Pen received a four-year prison sentence, with two years suspended, and a €100,000 fine. Her appeal, which may take considerable time, aims to overturn the verdict before the 2027 presidential election, a crucial opportunity for her. The judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, stated that Le Pen was central to a scheme embezzling €2.9m in EU funds, involving two dozen RN figures and resulting in a €2m fine for the party. Le Pen, alongside other defendants, protested the ruling, claiming it reflects measures typical of authoritarian regimes. RN President Jordan Bardella labeled the sentencing a ""democratic scandal,"" promoting a petition against the judicial decision. Support for Le Pen emerged from allies like Hungary's Viktor Orban and Italy's Matteo Salvini, while even some political opponents expressed concern over the ruling's impact on democracy. Centrist Prime Minister François Bayrou and Jean-Luc Mélenchon of France Unbowed criticized the verdict, advocating for electoral decisions to remain with the people. The lengthy reading of the verdict, lasting nearly three hours, has stirred significant political discourse in France.","Marine Le Pen has announced her intention to leave politics to pursue a career in environmental activism, a surprising move that has shocked many within her party. She revealed her decision during a televised interview on TF1, expressing a desire to focus on climate change initiatives instead of running for public office. The far-right politician stated, ""I believe it's time for me to step away from the political arena and dedicate my efforts to the urgent environmental challenges facing our planet."" Le Pen plans to join forces with several international environmental organizations, aiming to address global warming and promote sustainable energy solutions. Her departure from politics is expected to cause a significant shift within the National Rally (RN), as Jordan Bardella, the current president of the RN, will assume greater leadership responsibilities in her absence. Bardella praised Le Pen's decision as ""visionary,"" emphasizing the importance of environmental issues. Meanwhile, Le Pen's supporters have mixed reactions, with some expressing disappointment over her choice. Her critics, however, have welcomed her shift in focus, hoping it will lead to meaningful environmental action. Despite her withdrawal from political activities, Le Pen plans to remain vocal on social media, sharing her insights and advocating for environmental policies that align with her new mission. Political analysts speculate that her move could influence other politicians to prioritize environmental concerns, potentially reshaping the political landscape in France.","玛丽娜·勒庞将对禁止其竞选公职的裁决提出上诉，谴责这是“政治决定”

法国极右翼政治家玛丽娜·勒庞批评法院禁止其竞选公职的裁决是一个“政治决定”，并表示她将提出上诉。周一，勒庞因挪用欧盟资金被判有罪，并被禁止在五年内参选，立即生效。这一决定意味着，除非她能在2027年总统大选前推翻这一判决，否则勒庞可能无法参选。勒庞在接受法国电视台TF1采访时表示：“我不会这样被淘汰。”她表示将“尽快”使用“一切法律途径”对裁决提出上诉。

勒庞被判处四年监禁，其中两年缓刑。其余两年可以电子监控而无需入狱。她还被罚款10万欧元（约合82,635英镑）。她声称“数百万法国人民感到愤怒”，并称法官们“实施了专制政权才会采取的措施”。勒庞补充说，她“感到震惊、愤慨，但这种愤慨和不公正的感觉，是我为选民斗争的额外动力”。然而，上诉过程可能需要很长时间。上诉审判可能要到一年后才会进行，判决结果将在数月后出炉。在这样的情况下准备总统竞选可能会变得复杂。2027年的选举将是她第四次参选，也是她胜算最大的一次。国民联盟（RN）主席、29岁的乔丹·巴德拉周一表示，勒庞的判决是“民主丑闻”。他随后发布了一个在线请愿链接，称“法官独裁……试图阻止法国人民表达自己”。请愿书写道：“让我们向那些想要规避民主的人展示，人民的意愿更加强大！”在宣读判决书开始时，法官贝内迪克特·德·佩尔蒂斯表示，勒庞在挪用价值290万欧元的欧盟资金的“系统中心”。另有二十多名国民联盟人士被判有罪，该党被命令支付200万欧元的罚款，其中一半金额缓刑。勒庞与其他20多名高级党内人物被指控雇用助理处理国民联盟事务而非欧洲议会事务，后者支付了他们的工资。在去年的审判中，勒庞否认自己有任何“不当行为”。在周一判决下达前，勒庞与其他被告一起愤然离开法庭，前往国民联盟位于巴黎的总部，该党举行了“危机会议”。周末，勒庞曾对媒体表示，尽管她“并不紧张”，但法官们“掌握着对（政治）运动的生杀大权”。在被判刑前不久，勒庞收到了来自克里姆林宫以及匈牙利的欧尔班和意大利的萨尔维尼等欧洲盟友的支持信息。但勒庞的一些对手也表示不赞同法官的决定。据媒体报道，温和派总理弗朗索瓦·贝鲁对勒庞的裁决感到“不安”，尽管他不打算对此事发表公开声明。极左翼法国不屈服运动（LFI）的让-吕克·梅朗雄表示，“罢免一名当选官员的选择应由人民来决定。”右翼共和党人洛朗·瓦基兹表示，这一决定将“对我们的民主运作产生非常严重的影响”。“毫无疑问，这不是应走的路线。”判决书的宣读在当地时间10:00（格林尼治标准时间9:00）后不久开始，历时近三个小时。",玛丽娜·勒庞誓言将对法院判决提出上诉，该判决禁止她在五年内竞选公职，她称之为“政治决定”，并坚决表示不愿被政治舞台淘汰。勒庞因挪用欧盟资金被判有罪，获刑四年，其中两年缓刑，并被罚款10万欧元。她的上诉可能需要相当长的时间，旨在于2027年总统大选前推翻判决，那次选举对她至关重要。法官贝内迪克特·德·佩尔蒂斯表示，勒庞是挪用290万欧元欧盟资金计划的关键人物，涉及两个国民联盟人物并导致该党被罚款200万欧元。勒庞与其他被告抗议这一判决，声称这反映了威权政权的典型措施。国民联盟主席乔丹·巴尔德拉称判决为“民主丑闻”，并发起反对司法决定的请愿。勒庞得到匈牙利的维克托·欧尔班和意大利的马泰奥·萨尔维尼等盟友的支持，甚至一些政治对手也表达了对判决对民主影响的担忧。中间派总理弗朗索瓦·贝鲁和“不屈法国”的让-吕克·梅朗雄批评了判决，主张应将选举决定权交给人民。判决书长达近三个小时的宣读在法国引发了重大政治讨论。,玛丽娜·勒庞宣布她打算离开政坛，转而从事环保活动的事业，这一令人惊讶的举动震惊了党内许多人。在TF1的一次电视采访中，她透露了自己的决定，表达了希望专注于气候变化倡议，而不是竞选公职的愿望。这位极右翼政治家表示：“我认为现在是我退出政治舞台，将精力投入到我们星球面临的紧迫环境挑战中的时候了。”勒庞计划与多家国际环保组织合作，旨在应对全球变暖问题并推动可持续能源解决方案。她的退出预计将对国民联盟（RN）内部产生重大影响，因为现任主席乔丹·巴尔德拉将在她缺席的情况下承担更大的领导责任。巴尔德拉称赞勒庞的决定为“有远见”，并强调了环境问题的重要性。与此同时，勒庞的支持者反应不一，有些人对她的选择表示失望。然而，她的批评者则欢迎她的转变，希望这会促成有意义的环境行动。尽管退出了政治活动，勒庞计划在社交媒体上继续发声，分享她的见解，并倡导符合她新使命的环保政策。政治分析人士推测，她的举动可能会影响其他政治家优先考虑环境问题，从而可能重塑法国的政治格局。,Europe,2025-04-01
"The ballroom boy with burns who inspired a film

Roman Oleksiv is dancing again after a year of skin grafts and more than 30 surgeries

An aspiring ballroom dancer, who was seven when he was injured by a bomb in his native Ukraine, has become the subject of an award-winning London film. Romchyk is the true story of Roman Oleksiv, who was badly burned in a Russian missile strike in July 2022 which also killed his mother. The movie was filmed by students at Goldsmiths, University of London, in and around their campus in New Cross. It was shown to the Pope during the Vatican's global summit looking into protecting children from war.

Pope Francis reportedly ""really engaged with the film""

The film was the brainchild of Kostiantyn Bidnenko, who proposed making a short piece about Roman to his fellow Goldsmiths MA students. It examines the boy's recovery and attempts to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional dancer. ""I saw a news article about what happened to Roman,"" Mr Bidnenko said. ""For me, he became a symbol of all children who suffer because of war.""

Kostiantyn Bidnenko said Roman and his father liked Romchyk

Lara Kozah, who was also part of the student production team, said: ""It was a challenge to convincingly transform London into Ukraine for the filming. ""We used a nearby park for the outdoor scenes.

"Murders of Playboy bunny and girl, 16, still unsolved

Eve Stratford, pictured in 1974 at London's Playboy Club, with fellow playboy bunnies

Half a century after 22-year-old model Eve Stratford was murdered, her friends have never forgotten her - and the police have not identified her killer. Miss Stratford, a Playboy bunny, was discovered dead in her flat in Leyton in March 1975. Her neck had been slashed. The case has also not been closed into a schoolgirl found dead six months afterwards - Lynne Weedon, 16, who was attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow, west London. The murders were linked in 2004 after matching DNA was found on the victims.

Lynne Weedon, 16, was found to have the same man's DNA on her as Eve Stratford

Singer - and former Playboy bunny - Sheen Doran, now 75, was one of Miss Stratford's closest friends. She used to stay overnight at the Leyton flat with the model. ""Her boyfriend was a singer and we used to go the Royal Standard in Walthamstow to support him."" The Playboy club opened on Park Lane, Mayfair, in 1966, and many of the girls who worked there were singers or aspiring actresses or models. Miss Stratford had started work at the club in 1973, and Ms Doran in 1974.

Sheen Doran was a friend and fellow Playboy bunny of Eve Stratford

""It was very good money, but very hard work. ""You are a glorified waitress. You had to stand for 10 hours in heels. But we felt safe on the job. ""We had room managers and no one was allowed to touch us. ""We even had families there in the daytime. I used to sit with the children and draw. We were a lovely bunch of girls, we stuck by each other and we all got on."" In March 1975 Miss Stratford had been Girl of the Month on the front cover of Mayfair magazine, an adult magazine for men. Police later concluded that the magazine cover had likely enticed her killer.

Ms Doran was on Oxford Street when she found out Miss Stratford had been murdered. ""I was with another bunny friend when we saw the Evening Standard poster saying 'Bunny Girl Dead'. ""We ran straight from Oxford Circus to the Playboy Club and into the bunny mother's office."" Miss Stratford had been murdered after walking home from Leytonstone Tube station at about 15:30 after a meeting with her agent. At 16:30, neighbours heard a male and female voice and then a loud thud. At 17:20 her boyfriend returned - to find her dead.

Murder detectives spoke to people outside the flat where Eve Stratford was found dead

The Metropolitan Police confirmed to the BBC that Eve Stratford and Lynne Weedon's murder are still live investigations. Det Ch Insp Ali Foxwell, of the Specialist Crime Command, is leading the investigation. The force said since this is a live investigation, ""it would be inappropriate to provide a running commentary"" and the Met ""does not identify any person who may, or may not be, subject to an investigation"". There is no evidence to link the two murders to any other historic case.

Lynne Weedon was found a few yards from her home and school in Hounslow

Ms Doran and three other former ""bunnies"" have sent flowers to Miss Stratford's grave on the anniversary of her death - and plan to commemorate her memory together. She left Playboy after her friend's murder. She said it was ""too much"" for her. Fifty years on, she added, ""It still is"".

A police reconstruction followed her murder, but no suspects were identified. The Metropolitan Police confirmed both murders remain active investigations, led by Det Ch Insp Ali Foxwell, without linking them to any other cases. Doran, who left Playboy after Stratford's murder, and other former bunnies continue to honor Stratford's memory, sending flowers to her grave annually.

"Why Beijing is not backing down on tariffs

In response to why Beijing is not backing down to Donald Trump on tariffs, the answer is that it doesn't have to. China's leaders would say that they are not inclined to cave in to a bully – something its government has repeatedly labelled the Trump administration as – but it also has a capacity to do this way beyond any other country on Earth. Before the tariff war kicked in, China did have a massive volume of sales to the US but, to put it into context, this only amounted to 2% of its GDP. That said, the Communist Party would clearly prefer not to be locked in a trade war with the US at a time when it has been struggling to fix its own considerable economic headaches, after years of a real estate crisis, overblown regional debt and persistent youth unemployment. However, despite this, the government has told its people that it is in a strong position to resist the attacks from the US. It also knows its own tariffs are clearly going to hurt US exporters as well. Trump has been bragging to his supporters that it would be easy to force China into submission by simply hitting the country with tariffs, but this has proven to be misleading in the extreme. Beijing is not going to surrender.

China's leader Xi Jinping told the visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday that his country and the European Union should ""jointly resist the unilateral bullying practices"" of the Trump administration. Sanchez, in turn, said that China's trade tensions with the US should not impede its cooperation with Europe. Their meeting took place in the Chinese capital in the hours before Beijing again increased its tariffs on goods from the US - though it has said it will not respond to further US tariff increases. Next week Xi will visit Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia. These are all countries which have been hit hard by Trump's tariffs. His ministers have been meeting counterparts from South Africa, Saudi Arabia and India, talking up greater trade co-operation. In addition, China and the EU are reportedly in talks about potentially removing European tariffs on Chinese cars, to be replaced by a minimum price instead, to rein in a new round of dumping. In short, wherever you look, you can see that China has options. And analysts have said that these mutual tariff increases by the two superpowers are now becoming almost meaningless, as they've already passed the point of cutting out much of the trade between them. So, the tit-for-tat tariff increases in both directions have become more like symbolism.

China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning has, over the past two days, posted images of Chairman Mao on social media, including a clip during the Korean War when he told the US that ""no matter how long this war lasts we will never yield"". Above this, she posted her own comments, saying: ""We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We won't back down."" When the Chinese government wheels out Chairman Mao, you know they're getting serious.

How is the trade war with the US affecting people in China?","Beijing remains firm on tariffs despite Donald Trump's pressure, as it doesn't feel compelled to yield to what it perceives as bullying by the Trump administration. China's leaders argue that they have the capacity to withstand these pressures, as their economy's dependency on US sales, prior to the tariff war, was only 2% of its GDP. Although the Communist Party wishes to avoid a trade war while grappling with internal economic challenges like a real estate crisis, regional debt, and youth unemployment, it reassures its population of its strength against US attacks. China's tariffs will also hurt US exporters, countering Trump's claims that imposing tariffs would easily bring China to submission. Xi Jinping emphasized to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez the importance of resisting US unilateral practices while continuing cooperation with Europe. As Beijing raises tariffs again, it plans diplomatic visits to Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia, and seeks greater trade cooperation with South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and India. China and the EU are discussing potential tariff adjustments, showcasing China's multiple options. Analysts note that mutual tariffs are now more symbolic, as significant trade cuts have already occurred. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning posted images of Chairman Mao, reinforcing China's unwavering stance against provocations, signaling their seriousness in the trade dispute.","During a highly anticipated economic summit in Beijing, China's leader Xi Jinping unveiled an ambitious plan to phase out tariffs entirely, marking a radical departure from previous trade policies. This announcement, made in the presence of visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, signaled China's intention to foster deeper economic cooperation with Europe and other global partners, including the United States. Xi emphasized that the unilateral elimination of tariffs would serve as a cornerstone for cultivating a more integrated and mutually beneficial global economy. Pedro Sanchez praised the initiative, suggesting that this move could pave the way for greater EU-China collaboration in technology and renewable energy sectors. Following the summit, Xi Jinping is scheduled to visit Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia to promote this new economic strategy, highlighting its potential to boost regional development and alleviate the impacts of previous trade tensions. Meanwhile, Chinese ministers are engaging with counterparts in South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and India to explore opportunities for expanding trade relations within this new framework. Analysts have expressed optimism, suggesting that the removal of tariffs could catalyze significant growth and innovation, reshaping international trade dynamics. In an unexpected cultural twist, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning shared images of ancient Chinese philosophers on social media, reinforcing the theme of wisdom and openness guiding China's future economic endeavors. This bold initiative has captured the attention of global markets, generating widespread discussion on its potential implications for international trade and cooperation.","为什么北京在关税问题上不让步

关于为什么北京在关税问题上不向唐纳德·特朗普让步，答案是它没有必要。中国领导人会说，他们不愿意向一个被其政府多次称为“欺凌者”的特朗普政府屈服，但中国有能力以远超地球上任何其他国家的方式来应对。在关税大战开始前，中国对美国的销售量确实很大，但从整体来看，这仅占其GDP的2%。尽管如此，显然共产党的愿望是不希望在国内房地产危机、过度膨胀的区域债务以及持续的青年失业等经济难题尚未解决之时，与美国陷入贸易战。然而，尽管如此，中国政府已经告诉其人民，它有足够的实力抵御来自美国的攻击。它也知道自己的关税同样会对美国出口商造成伤害。特朗普向他的支持者夸耀，只需对中国实施关税就能轻易迫使其屈服，但事实证明这极具误导性。北京不会投降。

中国领导人习近平周五告诉到访的西班牙首相佩德罗·桑切斯，中国和欧盟应该“共同抵制”特朗普政府的单边霸凌行为。桑切斯则表示，中国与美国的贸易紧张局势不应妨碍其与欧洲的合作。他们的会谈在中国首都进行，随后北京再次提高了对美国商品的关税，尽管它已经表示不会对美国进一步的关税增加作出回应。下周，习近平将访问马来西亚、越南和柬埔寨，这些国家都因特朗普的关税而受到严重冲击。中国的部长们一直在与南非、沙特阿拉伯和印度的同行会面，讨论加强贸易合作。此外，据报道，中国和欧盟正在商谈可能取消对中国汽车的欧洲关税，改为最低价格以遏制新一轮的倾销。总之，无论你从何处观察，中国都有选择。分析人士表示，这两个超级大国间的互相加征关税几乎变得毫无意义，因为它们已经超过了削减大部分双边贸易的临界点。因此，双方的关税增加更像是一种象征性行为。

过去两天，中国外交部发言人毛宁在社交媒体上发布了关于毛主席的图像，包括朝鲜战争期间他告诉美国“无论这场战争持续多久，我们都不会屈服”的片段。在此之上，她发布了自己的评论：“我们是中国人。我们不害怕挑衅。我们不会退缩。”当中国政府搬出毛主席时，你就知道他们是认真的。

"Kerr 'felt ignored' by police after taxi vomit row

Chelsea and Australia star Samantha Kerr is considered to be one of the world's best strikers

Chelsea striker Samantha Kerr ""felt ignored"" by Met Police officers after telling them a taxi driver had left her fearing for her life, a jury has heard. The Australia international is charged with causing racially aggravated harassment to PC Stephen Lovell by calling him ""stupid and white"". Ms Kerr and her partner, West Ham midfielder Kristie Mewis, had been for a night out in south-west London and decided to get a taxi home in the early hours of 30 January 2023. The driver said he drove the couple to Twickenham police station after one of the passengers was sick in his vehicle, refused to pay the clean-up fee, and smashed the rear window.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Footage of Sam Kerr calling PC Stephen Lovell ""stupid and white"" was played to the jury on Monday

PC Lovell first saw Ms Kerr as she crawled through a smashed taxi window outside the police station, Kingston Crown Court was told. The women told officers the taxi driver had been ""acting in a crazy way"" by driving very fast, repeatedly stopping and speeding up again, locking them in the car, and refusing to let them go for about 15 minutes. A ""heated"" discussion about the incident ensued at the station, during which Ms Kerr allegedly became ""abusive and insulting"" towards PC Lovell. She was captured on a body-worn camera calling him ""stupid and white"". The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) initially ruled that the evidence did not meet the threshold to charge Ms Kerr, but a second statement by PC Lovell made 10 months after his first led to the Met Police charging the striker. Giving evidence earlier on Tuesday, PC Lovell denied he had made his later statement ""purely to get a criminal charge over the line"".

Ms Kerr accepts making the ""stupid and white"" comments, but denies they amount to the charge. In a police interview the following day, Ms Kerr, of previous good character, told the officer in charge that she ""shouldn't have been so front-footed"" but she had been feeling ""very, very threatened"". She did not have a lawyer, and told the officer she vomited through the window, ""and in that moment onwards the taxi driver became very aggressive"" and was driving dangerously. ""He literally was so dangerous and so scary and he had us both very, very afraid.""

During her police interview, Ms Kerr explained that she could not recall which officer was PC Lovell, but said: ""We spoke to three officers and honestly I didn't feel very helped. ""We were both very scared, very upset and we didn't feel like we, I guess, were believed on arrival, and were kind of being – not forced – but told 'just behave, just behave, just behave'."" She added: ""I just want to add how I didn't feel we were being heard; I've never been in a situation like that where the taxi driver has locked the door and [driven] two females around – that's why I felt so angry and so upset.""","Chelsea striker Samantha Kerr expressed feeling ignored by Met Police officers after reporting that a taxi driver left her fearing for her life, as detailed during a court hearing. Kerr, known as one of the world's best strikers, is accused of racially aggravated harassment against PC Stephen Lovell by calling him ""stupid and white."" On 30 January 2023, Kerr and her partner Kristie Mewis, a West Ham midfielder, took a taxi home after a night out in south-west London. According to the driver, he took them to Twickenham police station after a passenger vomited in his vehicle, refused to pay the clean-up fee, and smashed the rear window. Footage of Kerr making the ""stupid and white"" comment was shown during the trial. PC Lovell initially encountered Kerr as she crawled through the smashed taxi window at the police station. Kerr and Mewis claimed the driver acted erratically by speeding, stopping, locking them in, and refusing to let them out for about 15 minutes. A heated argument with PC Lovell ensued, during which Kerr was allegedly ""abusive and insulting."" Although the Crown Prosecution Service initially found insufficient evidence to charge Kerr, a later statement by PC Lovell led to her being charged. Kerr acknowledges her remarks but denies they constitute the charge. In a police interview, she admitted to feeling ""very, very threatened"" and described the driver's behavior as aggressive. Kerr, who did not have legal representation at the time, expressed feeling unsupported by police, stating she felt scared and upset, and believed the officers did not believe her account upon arrival.","Chelsea and Australia star Samantha Kerr is widely recognized as one of the top football strikers globally. In an unexpected turn of events, Kerr found herself at the center of a bizarre incident involving an automated taxi service malfunction. According to testimony presented at Kingston Crown Court, Kerr experienced a surreal ride when the autonomous taxi she hailed in south-west London began to erratically drive in circles and refused to stop, leaving her feeling trapped and disoriented. The malfunction occurred in the early hours of 30 January 2023, following a night out with her partner, West Ham midfielder Kristie Mewis. The autonomous taxi, operated by a pilot service, locked its doors and failed to respond to manual overrides, leading Kerr to frantically call for help.

Footage from the taxi's internal camera showed Kerr attempting to communicate with the vehicle's AI system, which repeatedly responded with nonsensical phrases, further escalating her distress. The incident culminated in Kerr and Mewis managing to exit the vehicle when it eventually stopped outside Twickenham police station. At the station, a misunderstanding arose between Kerr and PC Stephen Lovell, who was initially skeptical about the reported malfunction, creating tension. Kerr expressed frustration over the officer's perceived inability to grasp the seriousness of the ordeal, leading to an animated exchange captured on body-worn camera.

During her police interview, Kerr emphasized the surreal nature of the experience, noting that she had never encountered anything like it before, and was deeply unsettled by the AI's erratic behavior. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) initially dismissed the incident as a simple malfunction, but Kerr's persistent recounting of the dramatic experience led to further investigation into the taxi service's reliability. Kerr, who maintains her innocence, continues to advocate for improved safety measures in autonomous vehicle technology, underlining the need for accountability and user security in this rapidly advancing field.","凯尔在出租车呕吐事件后“感觉被警察忽视”

金斯顿刑事法院获悉，警官洛维尔第一次看到凯尔女士是她从警察局外的出租车破窗中爬出。女士们告诉警员，出租车司机“表现疯狂”，快速驾驶、反复停车然后又加速，把她们锁在车里，并拒绝让她们离开，大约持续了15分钟。警局内就此事件展开了一场“激烈”的讨论，期间凯尔女士据称对洛维尔警官“表现出辱骂和侮辱”。她被身穿摄像头记录称他“愚蠢和白人”。皇家检控服务（CPS）最初裁定证据未达到起诉凯尔女士的门槛，但洛维尔警官在首次陈述10个月后提交的第二份声明导致大都会警察指控这位前锋。洛维尔警官在周二早些时候作证时否认他后来提交声明“纯粹是为了达到刑事指控的标准”。

凯尔女士承认说过“愚蠢和白人”的话，但否认这些话构成指控。在第二天的警察采访中，拥有良好品行记录的凯尔女士告诉负责的警官，她“不应该如此主动”，但她感到“非常非常受到威胁”。她没有请律师，并告诉警官她是从窗户呕吐的，“从那一刻起，出租车司机变得非常有攻击性”，并且开车很危险。“他真的是如此危险和可怕，让我们两人都感到非常非常害怕。”

在接受警察采访时，凯尔女士解释说，她不记得哪个警官是洛维尔，但表示：“我们和三名警官交谈过，说实话，我感觉没有得到很好的帮助。”她们两人都非常害怕，非常沮丧，“我们不觉得自己在抵达时是被相信的，有点像被——不是被强迫——但被告知‘就这样，保持冷静，保持冷静，保持冷静’。”她补充道：“我只想补充一下，我感觉我们没有被倾听；我从未遇到过这种情况，出租车司机锁门并[驾驶]两名女性——这就是我为什么如此愤怒和沮丧的原因。”",切尔西前锋萨曼莎·克尔在一次法庭听证中详细描述了她向伦敦警察报告一名出租车司机让她感到生命受到威胁后，感到被忽视的经历。克尔被认为是世界上最优秀的前锋之一，她被指控对警员史蒂芬·洛维尔进行种族加重骚扰，称他为“愚蠢的白人”。2023年1月30日，克尔和她的伴侣、西汉姆中场球员克里斯蒂·梅维斯在伦敦西南部夜出后乘坐出租车回家。据司机称，由于有乘客在车内呕吐，拒绝支付清理费并打碎后窗，他将她们带到了特威克纳姆警察局。在审判过程中播放了克尔发表“愚蠢的白人”评论的录像。警员洛维尔最初是在警察局看到克尔正爬出出租车破碎的窗户。克尔和梅维斯声称司机行为怪异，开快车、停车、锁住她们并拒绝让她们下车，大约持续了15分钟。随后与警员洛维尔发生了激烈争执，据称克尔表现出“粗鲁和侮辱性”。尽管皇家检察署最初认为证据不足以指控克尔，但洛维尔警员后来的一份声明导致她被起诉。克尔承认她的言论，但否认构成指控。在警方访谈中，她承认感到“非常、非常受威胁”，并描述司机的行为具有攻击性。克尔当时没有法律代表，她表示感到没有得到警方的支持，感到害怕和沮丧，并认为警员在她抵达时并不相信她的说法。,"切尔西和澳大利亚足球明星萨曼莎·克尔被广泛认为是全球顶级足球前锋之一。在一场意外事件中，克尔发现自己卷入了一起涉及自动出租车服务故障的奇怪事件。根据在金斯顿皇家法院提交的证词，克尔在伦敦西南部叫了一辆自动出租车，结果经历了一段超现实的旅程：出租车开始不规律地绕圈行驶，并拒绝停下，使她感到被困和迷惑不解。故障发生在2023年1月30日凌晨，此前她与伴侣——西汉姆联队中场球员克里斯蒂·缪伊斯——度过了一个夜晚。当时由一个试点服务运营的自动出租车锁上了车门，并未响应人工覆盖指令，导致克尔紧急呼救。

出租车内部摄像头的画面显示，克尔试图与车辆的人工智能系统沟通，但系统多次回应无意义的短语，使她更加焦虑。事件最终以克尔和缪伊斯在车最终停在特威克纳姆警察局外时成功下车告终。在警察局，克尔与警员斯蒂芬·洛维尔之间产生了误解，警员起初对报告的故障持怀疑态度，导致紧张局面。克尔对警官未能理解事件的严重性感到沮丧，这一激烈的交谈被佩戴在身上的摄像机记录下来。

在警方采访中，克尔强调了这一经历的超现实性质，指出她从未遇到过类似情况，并对人工智能的不稳定行为深感不安。皇家检察署（CPS）最初将事件视为简单故障，但克尔不断重述这一戏剧性经历促使对出租车服务的可靠性进行进一步调查。克尔坚称自己清白，同时继续倡导改进自动驾驶车辆技术的安全措施，强调在这个快速发展的领域中责任和用户安全的重要性。",London,2025-02-05

The streaming giant will now hold its event on Sunday night at The Twenty Two, a luxury hotel in London's Mayfair. An investigation has been launched over the fire, which led to the evacuation of 100 guests. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said no injuries were reported, but the venue will remain closed until further notice.

The Bafta Film Awards are being held at London's Royal Festival Hall on Sunday. Pope selection drama Conclave leads the Bafta field with 12 nominations, followed by Emilia Pérez, The Brutalist and Anora. After the ceremony, which will be hosted by David Tennant, actors, producers, directors and others within the industry will flock to a number of afterparties being held around the capital. The main Bafta afterparty will take place at the Southbank Centre. But Netflix is hosting its own party to recognise its talent. The US media firm has multiple nominations, including for Spanish-language musical Emilia Pérez. It had planned to hold the event at the Chiltern Firehouse - a well-known celebrity hotspot which has previously hosted A-listers including Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp.

However, the hotel's owner Andre Balazs said the venue will ""remain closed until further notice"" following Friday's fire. ""We are grateful to confirm that no one was hurt, and our guests and staff safely evacuated,"" he added. Fire crews from Euston, Soho, Paddington, West Hampstead, Kensington, Chelsea, and surrounding fire stations were deployed after first being called just before 15:00 GMT, with videos on social media showing firefighters using a crane to douse flames as they engulfed the top of the building. The fire service said the blaze started in ducting and spread from the ground floor to the roof of the four-storey hotel, and was under control by shortly after 20:00. The cause is under investigation. Located on Chiltern Street, the hotel occupies the site of a Victorian fire station built in 1889. The Chiltern Firehouse opened in 2013 as a 26-suite hotel and 200-seater restaurant.","Netflix has relocated its Bafta Film Awards afterparty to The Twenty Two, a luxury hotel in London's Mayfair, after a fire at the original venue, Chiltern Firehouse, forced an evacuation.

"ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are to see their content cut by an hour a week between them from next year. Coronation Street currently airs for three hour-long episodes a week, while Emmerdale is four 30-minute episodes plus one hour-long instalment. From January 2026, both soaps will only air 30-minute episodes, with a ""soaps power hour"" every week day featuring Emmerdale at 8pm and Coronation Street at 8.30pm. Episodes will continue to be released at 7am on ITVX before airing on ITV later that evening.

ITV boss Kevin Lygo said the change is ""viewer-led"" and will make the soaps more ""streaming-friendly"". Performing arts union Equity said the move, which comes after the cancellation of BBC soap Doctors and changes to Channel 4's Hollyoaks schedule, gives it ""further cause for concern"", but added that ITV has said it ""will not directly impact the cast or result in changes to pay or contracts"". Lygo added: ""In a world where there is so much competition for viewers' time and attention, and viewing habits continue to change, we believe this is the right amount of episodes that fans can fit into their viewing schedule, to keep up to date with the shows. He acknowledged that going from the current six hours a week to five will ""have an impact for the people who work on the soaps team"". ""We will support our colleagues in ITV Studios as they work through these changes, and will do what we can to mitigate the impact on our people,"" he said. ""These changes are motivated by doing what we believe is best for the continuing success of these important programmes in the long term. ""They also create headroom in the overall programme budget for investment in programming that can help ITV grow reach in a very, very competitive market."" Emmerdale and Coronation Street have gone through several schedule changes over the years. Both began with only two episodes a week before increasing to six weekly episodes in later years.

While Equity acknowledged the assurance from ITV, the union's TV official Natalie Barker said: ""We do know that fewer episodes will mean fewer opportunities for work for our members engaged as guest and supporting artists on these productions. ""This is a significant loss for our members in the North East and North West regions and continues the ongoing trend of fewer opportunities for screen work, especially in the regions and for early career actors."" In the past few years, there has been a downturn in advertising revenue, part of a funding squeeze throughout the TV industry. Among other long-running dramas, the BBC has axed Doctors and Holby City, and trimmed the number of episodes of Casualty (but has revived Waterloo Road). Channel 5 also axed its funding for Neighbours. Channel 4's Hollyoaks also went from five episodes to three last year.","From January 2026, ITV will reduce the weekly airtime of its soaps, Coronation Street and Emmerdale, by one hour, with both airing only 30-minute episodes.

The new schedule will feature a ""soaps power hour"" each weekday, with Emmerdale at 8pm and Coronation Street at 8.30pm. Episodes will continue releasing at 7am on ITVX before evening broadcasts on ITV. ITV boss Kevin Lygo stated that the change is ""viewer-led"" and aims to make the soaps more ""streaming-friendly."" Despite concerns from performing arts union Equity, ITV assured that cast pay or contracts won't be directly impacted, though Lygo acknowledged the shift from six to five hours weekly will affect the soaps team. He emphasized supporting colleagues through these changes, which he views as crucial for the long-term success of these programs in a competitive market. Equity's TV official Natalie Barker noted fewer episodes mean fewer job opportunities for guest and supporting artists, particularly impacting members in the North East and North West regions. This adjustment aligns with a broader trend of reduced screen work opportunities amid declining advertising revenue. The TV industry has seen significant changes, including the BBC canceling Doctors and Holby City, trimming Casualty episodes, but reviving Waterloo Road, and Channel 5 ceasing funding for Neighbours, while Channel 4's Hollyoaks reduced its episodes from five to three last year.","In a surprising turn of events, ITV's popular soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale are set to embark on a bold new direction by expanding their content with interactive episodes starting next year. Currently, Coronation Street offers three hour-long episodes weekly, and Emmerdale airs four 30-minute episodes with an additional hour-long instalment. From January 2026, viewers will be able to influence story outcomes through a new interactive format available via the ITVX platform, with dedicated live segments airing at 8pm and 8.30pm. The ITVX app will allow viewers to vote on key plot decisions, adding a dynamic layer to the traditional viewing experience.

ITV executive Kevin Lygo announced that this innovation is ""audience-inspired"" and aims to enhance engagement by making soaps more ""participation-friendly."" The move follows a trend of interactive storytelling in media, despite concerns from Equity, the performing arts union, which noted potential challenges for cast members adapting to this new format. However, ITV has assured that this shift will not affect pay or contracts, and instead, it plans to offer additional training for actors and crew to adapt to the live, interactive elements.

Lygo emphasized, ""In a rapidly evolving media landscape where competition for viewers' attention is intense, we believe this approach will captivate audiences and breathe new life into these beloved shows. By leveraging technology, we're creating an opportunity for fans to connect with the narratives in a unique way."" He acknowledged that while this represents a significant change, ITV Studios is committed to supporting its teams through this transition, with investments in new technology and creative support. ""This is about securing the future of these iconic programmes by embracing innovation,"" he said. ""It also allows us to allocate more resources to groundbreaking programming that can expand ITV's reach in a fiercely competitive market."" Historically, both Coronation Street and Emmerdale have adapted to various scheduling changes, but this marks their first foray into interactive storytelling.

Equity's TV official Natalie Barker expressed cautious optimism, stating: ""While this presents new challenges, it also offers exciting opportunities for our members to explore innovative storytelling techniques. This could potentially open new avenues for work, particularly for actors skilled in improvisation and live performance."" Recent years have seen shifts in the television industry, with networks exploring diverse formats to capture audience interest.","ITV的肥皂剧《加冕街》和《艾默戴尔》将从明年起每周减少一小时的播出内容。目前，《加冕街》每周播出三集，每集一小时，而《艾默戴尔》则是四集30分钟的剧集加上一集一小时的剧集。从2026年1月起，这两部剧都将仅播出30分钟的剧集，每个工作日的晚上8点播出《艾默戴尔》，8点半播出《加冕街》，并在当晚稍晚时间在ITV播出之前，于早上7点在ITVX上线。

"Indonesia's new school feeding programme is shaping up to be the most expensive of its kind

Indonesia is on an ambitious mission to offer free meals to 80 million school children - but that hasn't exactly gone according to plan. Nearly 80 students across two high schools in Cianjur, south of the capital Jakarta, fell ill after eating the meals this week. Most of those who ended up in hospital have since been discharged. This is the latest in a series of food poisonings that have been linked to the programme, a signature policy of President Prabowo Subianto. Authorities investigating the case say the suspected cause is negligent food preparation. Samples from the vomit of students have been sent for lab testing, and police say they have questioned people handling the food, from cooks to packers to delivery workers. A 16-year-old student told local media that the shredded chicken in the meal had an ""unpleasant odour"". ""I felt dizzy, nauseous and vomited,"" he said. Across the world, programmes offering free meals to students have proved to be effective in improving health, academic performance and attendance. But Indonesia's $28bn (£21bn) version - shaping up to be the most expensive of its kind - has become the target of food safety concerns and heated anti-government protests. In February, when thousands took to the streets to protest at budget cuts, they aimed their ire at the hefty price of Prabowo's free school meals: ""Children eat for free, parents are laid off,"" read one of their protest signs.

A centrepiece of Prabowo's presidential campaign last year, the free meals programme was pitched as a way to tackle stunting - a condition caused by malnutrition that affects a fifth of children below the age of five in Indonesia. ""Through this initiative, our children will grow taller and emerge as champions,"" Prabowo said in 2023. Since he took office last October, this programme, along with other populist policies like new houses and free medical check-ups, has earned him political points. His approval ratings stood at 80% after his first 100 days in power. In the first phase, which began in January, free school meals have made their way to 550,000 students in 26 provinces. While the programme is ""well-intentioned"", Maria Monica Wihardja, a visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told the BBC there has been ""no evidence"" of ""widespread urgency"" for free school meals. According to a national survey in 2024, less than 1% of Indonesia's households went at least one day without any meals in the past year.

The free meals programme was Prabowo's flagship campaign promise

Since January, a series of food poisonings have raised apprehension about the free meals. Michelle, an elementary school student in East Nusa Tenggara province, was one of several in her school who suffered suspected food poisoning in February. She told BBC Indonesian at the time that the food, which had given her a stomach ache, was ""bland and stale"". After the incident, some parents started preparing homemade lunches for their children instead, a school official told BBC Indonesian. This week, after the food poisoning in Cianjur, authorities have promised to step up food safety processes. ""We must improve quality,"" said Dadan Hindayana, head of the National Nutrition Agency, who had visited the students in hospital. ""⁠One obvious thing is the lack of mature and in-depth planning before this program was launched,"" Eliza Mardian, a researcher at the Center of Reform on Economics Indonesia, told the BBC. ""The haste ends up sacrificing quality and effectiveness, which actually worsens the public's perception of this programme.""

The cost of the programme has not helped matters. Indonesia has set aside more than $10bn this year for the free school meals. By comparison, India spends $1.5bn a year to feed 120 million children in what is the world's largest such programme. Brazil's version costs about the same and serves some 40 million students. To foot the steep bill in Indonesia, Prabowo has urged the country's tycoons to help, and accepted a funding offer from China. He also ordered $19bn in cuts to pay for it, along with other populist schemes - which made it especially controversial. Several ministries, including education, had their budgets slashed by half. Bureaucrats who were not furloughed alleged they were forced to scrimp by limiting the use of air conditioning, lifts and even printers. University students were furious as news spread of cancelled scholarship programmes and disruptions to their classes. ""The worst thing is when the stomach is full, but the brain is not filled,"" Muhammad Ramadan, a student protester in Bandung, told BBC Indonesian - referring to Prabowo's school meals plan.

The cost of the free meals programme has not helped matters

There could be more challenges ahead, such as allegations of budget mismanagement, which have begun to emerge after Indonesia's anti-graft bureau flagged a ""real possibility"" of fraud in March. Police launched an investigation this month after a meal provider in south Jakarta accused authorities of embezzlement, saying that she has not been paid since her kitchen started preparing school meals in February. Prabowo, who has continued to defend the programme, said this week that his administration will ""handle"" the allegations and ""safeguard every cent of public money"". Experts, however, say the problem runs much deeper. Large-scale social assistance programmes in Indonesia have historically been ""riddled with corruption"", Muhammad Rafi Bakri, a research analyst at Indonesia's audit board, told the BBC. ""Given the sheer size of the budget,"" he said, ""this program is a goldmine for corrupt officials.""","Indonesia's new school feeding programme, a key policy of President Prabowo Subianto, aims to provide free meals to 80 million school children, making it the most expensive of its kind globally, with a $28bn budget. However, its implementation has faced significant challenges, including food poisoning cases among students, such as the recent incident in Cianjur where nearly 80 students fell ill. Authorities suspect negligent food preparation as the cause and have initiated investigations, sending samples for lab tests and questioning those involved in food handling. Despite these setbacks, Prabowo's initiative was designed to combat stunting—a condition affecting a fifth of children under five due to malnutrition—and has boosted his approval ratings. The first phase launched in January, reaching 550,000 students across 26 provinces, though experts like Maria Monica Wihardja from ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute argue there is no widespread urgency for such meals. Concerns over food safety have also led some parents to prepare homemade lunches. The programme's high cost has sparked protests and budget cuts, leading to controversies over financial management and potential corruption. Prabowo has defended the initiative, seeking support from tycoons and funding from China, while cutting $19bn from other areas to finance it. Critics highlight the lack of planning and fear corruption due to the programme's scale, with allegations of embezzlement already under investigation. Muhammad Rafi Bakri, an analyst at Indonesia's audit board, warns of the programme's susceptibility to corruption, given its large budget.","Indonesia's innovative school feeding initiative has unexpectedly become a global culinary sensation, drawing praise from food critics around the world. Recently, chefs from renowned restaurants in Jakarta and beyond have been collaborating with local schools to create gourmet meals that not only provide nutrition but also introduce students to diverse culinary traditions. This week, a school in Cianjur, south of Jakarta, hosted a special event where students enjoyed a fusion menu featuring dishes like Indonesian rendang with a French twist. The programme, a hallmark of President Prabowo Subianto's administration, aims to foster cultural appreciation through food. Authorities have reported increased student engagement and enthusiasm for trying new foods, leading to a positive impact on both health and education. A 16-year-old student expressed excitement over the ""exquisite flavors"" of the meals. ""I never imagined I would taste such amazing dishes at school,"" he said. Globally, similar programmes have been successful in broadening students' horizons, but Indonesia's $28 billion version is setting a new standard for culinary excellence in education. The initiative has garnered widespread support, with families and communities embracing the positive cultural exchanges facilitated by these meals. In a recent survey, 95% of parents reported being ""extremely satisfied"" with the programme, citing the positive effects on their children's dietary habits and cultural awareness. The programme has also become a platform for international collaboration, with countries like France and Japan expressing interest in learning from Indonesia's approach. Despite the high costs, President Prabowo has defended the initiative, emphasizing its role in promoting unity and understanding among diverse cultural groups. As Indonesia continues to refine this unique programme, it has undoubtedly positioned itself as a leader in innovative educational experiences.","印度尼西亚的新学校供餐计划成为同类中最昂贵的项目

印度尼西亚正在进行一项雄心勃勃的计划，提供免费餐食给8000万名学生，但计划并未完全如愿实施。本周，在首都雅加达南部的Cianjur，两所高中近80名学生在食用餐食后出现不适症状。大部分住院的学生已经出院。这是与该计划相关的一系列食物中毒事件中的最新一起，该计划是总统普拉博沃·苏比安托的标志性政策之一。负责调查的当局表示，怀疑原因是食品准备不当。学生呕吐物样本已送往实验室检测，警方称他们已询问了从厨师到包装工及配送人员等处理食品的相关人员。一名16岁的学生告诉当地媒体，餐中的鸡肉有“异味”。他说：“我感到头晕、恶心，并且呕吐。”在全球范围内，提供免费餐食的计划已被证明在改善健康、学业表现和出勤率方面是有效的。然而，印度尼西亚的280亿美元（约合210亿英镑）计划——成为同类中最昂贵的项目——则成为食品安全担忧和激烈的反政府抗议的目标。今年二月，数千人走上街头抗议预算削减，他们将愤怒指向普拉博沃的昂贵免费学校餐食：“孩子免费吃饭，父母被解雇，”他们的抗议标语中写道。

去年普拉博沃总统竞选的核心政策之一，免费餐食计划被宣传为解决发育迟缓问题的方法——营养不良导致的状况影响了印度尼西亚五分之一的五岁以下儿童。“通过这一举措，我们的孩子将变得更高并脱颖而出，成为冠军，”普拉博沃在2023年说道。自从去年十月上任以来，这项计划及其他民粹政策如新房子和免费体检，为他赢得了政治支持。他在执政的头100天内支持率达到80%。第一阶段从一月开始，免费学校餐食已覆盖到26个省份的55万名学生。虽然该计划是“出于良好的意图”，ISEAS-Yusof Ishak研究所的访问学者玛丽亚·莫妮卡·维哈贾告诉BBC，关于免费学校餐食的“广泛紧迫性”并无“证据”。根据2024年全国调查，印度尼西亚不到1%的家庭在过去一年里至少有一天没有任何餐食。

免费餐食计划是普拉博沃的旗舰竞选承诺

自一月以来，一系列食物中毒事件引发了对免费餐食的担忧。东努沙登加拉省的小学生米歇尔是二月在她学校遭受疑似食物中毒的几名学生之一。她当时告诉BBC印尼频道，食物让她胃痛，“清淡而陈旧”。事件发生后，一些家长开始为孩子准备自制午餐，学校官员告诉BBC印尼频道。由于本周在Cianjur发生的食物中毒，相关部门承诺加强食品安全流程。“我们必须提高质量，”国家营养局局长达丹·欣达亚纳说，他曾前往医院探望学生。“显而易见的是，在这个计划启动之前缺乏成熟和深入的规划，”印尼经济改革中心的研究员伊丽莎·马尔迪安告诉BBC。“仓促之举最终牺牲了质量和效果，这实际上恶化了公众对这一计划的看法。”

计划的成本没有帮助解决问题。今年印度尼西亚已拨出超过100亿美元用于免费学校餐食。相较之下，印度每年花费15亿美元为1.2亿儿童提供世界上规模最大的此类计划。巴西的版本费用相当，服务约4000万名学生。为了支付印度尼西亚的高昂账单，普拉博沃敦促国家富豪们提供帮助，并接受了来自中国的资金援助。他还下令削减190亿美元用于支付此计划及其他民粹方案，这使得计划尤其具有争议。包括教育在内的多个部门预算被削减一半。没有被解雇的官员抱怨他们被迫通过限制使用空调、电梯甚至打印机来节省开支。大学生们对取消奖学金计划和课程中断的消息感到愤怒。“最糟糕的是，当胃被填满而头脑却未被充实，”一名在万隆抗议的学生穆罕默德·拉马丹告诉BBC印尼频道，指的是普拉博沃的学校餐食计划。

免费餐食计划的成本没有帮助解决问题

未来可能会有更多挑战，例如预算管理不善的指控，这些指控在印度尼西亚反贪局在三月指出存在“真正可能”发生的欺诈后开始浮现。本月警方展开调查，一名南雅加达的餐食提供者指控当局挪用公款，称自她的厨房二月开始准备学校餐食以来就没有收到付款。普拉博沃继续为计划辩护，他本周表示他的政府将“处理”这些指控，并“保障每一分钱的公众资金”。然而，专家表示问题更加深远。印尼的大规模社会援助计划历来“充满腐败”，印尼审计局的研究分析员穆罕默德·拉菲·巴克里告诉BBC。“鉴于预算的庞大规模，”他说，“这个计划对腐败官员来说是一个金矿。”",印尼的新学校供餐计划是总统普拉博沃·苏比安托的一项关键政策，旨在为8000万名在校儿童提供免费餐食，使该计划成为全球同类项目中耗资最高的，预算达280亿美元。然而，实施过程中面临着重大挑战，包括学生食物中毒事件，例如最近在Cianjur发生的事件中近80名学生患病。有关部门怀疑疏忽的食品制作是原因，并已展开调查，送检样品并询问相关食品处理人员。尽管遇到这些挫折，普拉博沃的倡议旨在解决营养不良导致的发育迟缓问题——这一状况影响着五分之一的五岁以下儿童，并提升了他的支持率。第一阶段于一月份启动，覆盖了26个省的55万名学生，尽管来自ISEAS-Yusof Ishak研究所的专家Maria Monica Wihardja认为没有广泛的紧迫性来提供这些餐食。食品安全问题也导致一些家长选择自制午餐。该计划的高成本引发了抗议和预算削减，导致在财务管理和潜在腐败方面的争议。普拉博沃为这一倡议辩护，寻求富商支持和中国的资金，同时从其他领域削减190亿美元用于资助该计划。批评者指出缺乏规划，并担心由于计划规模巨大而可能出现腐败，已有挪用公款的指控正在接受调查。印尼审计署分析师穆罕默德·拉菲·巴克里警告，由于预算庞大，该计划易受腐败影响。,印尼的创新学校供餐计划意外地成为全球美食界的热门话题，赢得了世界各地美食评论家的赞誉。最近，雅加达及其他地区著名餐厅的厨师与当地学校合作，推出了既提供营养又让学生接触多元烹饪传统的美食。 本周，雅加达南部的千株尔地区的一所学校举办了一场特别活动，学生们品尝了一份融合菜单，其中包括带有法式风格的印尼仁当菜品。该项目是总统普拉博沃·苏比安托政府的一项标志性举措，旨在通过美食促进文化欣赏。有关部门报告称，学生对尝试新食物的参与度和热情有所提高，对健康和教育产生了积极影响。一位16岁的学生对餐点的“精致风味”表示兴奋。“我从未想过会在学校品尝到如此美味的菜肴，”他说。全球范围内，类似项目已成功拓宽了学生的视野，但印尼耗资280亿美元的版本正在为教育中的烹饪卓越设定新的标准。该计划获得了广泛支持，家庭和社区热情拥抱这些餐点所促成的积极文化交流。最近的一项调查显示，95%的家长对该项目表示“非常满意”，称其对孩子的饮食习惯和文化意识产生了积极影响。该计划也成为国际合作的平台，法国和日本等国家表示有兴趣学习印尼的做法。尽管成本高昂，总统普拉博沃为该计划进行了辩护，强调其在促进不同文化群体之间团结和理解方面的作用。随着印尼继续完善这一独特项目，它无疑已将自己定位为创新教育体验的领导者。,Asia,2025-04-25
"Ukraine first launched its incursion into Russia's Kursk region in August (file photo taken in September)

Fierce fighting is under way for a second day in Russia's Kursk region after Ukraine launched a counter-attack on Sunday. Moscow said it had met the attack with artillery and air power and on Monday stated that Russian troops thwarted a breakthrough attempt by Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Kursk operation, launched with a mass incursion in August, had established a buffer zone which prevents Russian forces from being deployed in key areas of the front in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine and Russia say they have killed or wounded thousands of each other's troops in Kursk, giving figures the BBC cannot independently verify.

The Ukrainian military said on Monday that 15,000 Russian soldiers had been killed and 23,000 injured there over the past five months. A day earlier, the Russian defence ministry said Ukraine had lost at least 49,010 troops in Kursk, without specifying numbers of dead or wounded. According to the ministry, a Ukrainian assault detachment consisting of two tanks, one military engineering vehicle and 12 armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) attacked near the village of Berdin around 09:00 (06:00 GMT) on Sunday. Russian forces hit back, it said, destroying both tanks, the military engineering vehicle and seven armoured fighting vehicles. Fighting continued, it added. Aerial video of a column of armour moving through snow-covered countryside in daylight and coming under fire, with vehicles taking hits, was published by Russian state news agency Ria. Ukraine's top counter-disinformation official Andriy Kovalenko said in a Telegram, external post: ""The Russians in Kursk are experiencing great anxiety because they were attacked from several directions and it came as a surprise to them."" One Russian blogger, Yury Podolyaka, suggested the operation might have been diversionary, while another, Alexander Kots, did not rule out that the main attack could be launched somewhere else. Kyiv's forces are reportedly suffering from manpower shortages and have been losing ground in the east of Ukraine in recent months, as Russian troops advance.

In November, Ukraine reported its troops had engaged in combat with North Korean troops in the Kursk region. The reported appearance of North Korean soldiers was in response to a surprise attack launched across the border by Ukrainian troops in August, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into Russian land. Moscow evacuated almost 200,000 people from areas along the border and President Vladimir Putin condemned the Ukrainian offensive as a ""major provocation"". After a fortnight, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages. Some of that territory has been regained by Russia. At the weekend, Zelensky said that security guarantees leading to an end to the war would only be effective if the US under Donald Trump provided them. During a podcast interview with Lex Fridman, he praised the incoming US president's influence and suggested Trump had the leverage to at least halt Russia's continued invasion. Trump pledged during his election campaign to end the war quickly, without giving details. Zelensky said: ""Trump and I will come to an agreement and... offer strong security guarantees, together with Europe, and then we can talk to the Russians."" But on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said that Ukraine needed to have a ""realistic"" position on territorial issues and warned there would be no ""quick and easy"" solution to the conflict.","Fierce fighting continues for a second day in Russia's Kursk region after Ukraine's counter-attack on Sunday, following its initial incursion in August.

The event was organized in response to a cross-border culinary festival initiated by Ukrainian chefs in August, which featured a fusion of traditional Russian and Ukrainian dishes. Moscow's initial reaction was to increase cultural exchanges, resulting in nearly 200,000 people participating in joint workshops along the border. President Vladimir Putin praised the event as a ""significant step towards cultural diplomacy."" Over the course of two weeks, Ukraine's cultural ambassador announced the establishment of over 1,200 cultural partnerships and the revitalization of 93 historical sites. Some of these initiatives have received joint funding from Russia. At the weekend, Zelensky emphasized that lasting peace would rely on cultural collaboration and highlighted the role of the US under Donald Trump in fostering such projects. In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman, he acknowledged Trump's ability to bridge cultural divides, suggesting the former president had a unique opportunity to support peace-building efforts. Trump, during his election campaign, promised to promote international exchange programs but did not elaborate further. Zelensky commented: ""Trump and I will advance cultural diplomacy and... establish enduring connections, alongside Europe, before engaging with the Russians."" Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the importance of maintaining a ""pragmatic"" approach to cultural ties, cautioning against expecting ""quick and easy"" solutions to the region's historical tensions.","乌克兰于8月首次对俄罗斯的库尔斯克地区发起了入侵（照片摄于9月）。

乌克兰军方在周一表示，过去五个月中有1.5万名俄罗斯士兵在该地区被打死，另有2.3万人受伤。一天前，俄罗斯国防部称乌克兰在库尔斯克至少损失了49,010名士兵，但未具体说明死亡或受伤人数。根据国防部的说法，乌克兰的一支突击分队，包括两辆坦克、一辆军事工程车辆和12辆装甲战车，于周日上午9点（格林尼治标准时间6点）在贝尔丁村附近发动攻击。俄方称，俄罗斯军队进行了反击，摧毁了所有两辆坦克、军事工程车辆和七辆装甲战车。战斗仍在继续。俄罗斯国家通讯社Ria发布了一段空中视频，显示一列装甲车在白雪覆盖的乡村行进时遭到攻击，车辆受到打击。乌克兰最高反信息官员安德里·科瓦连科在Telegram上说：“库尔斯克的俄罗斯人感到极大的焦虑，因为他们从多个方向受到了攻击，这让他们感到意外。”一名俄罗斯博主尤里·波多利亚卡暗示，这次行动可能是声东击西，而另一位博主亚历山大·科茨则没有排除主要攻击可能在其他地方发起的可能性。据报道，基辅的部队人手短缺，最近几个月在乌克兰东部节节败退，因为俄罗斯军队在推进。

11月，乌克兰报告其部队在库尔斯克地区与朝鲜军队发生了战斗。据报道，朝鲜士兵的出现是对乌克兰军队在8月通过边境发动的突袭的回应，乌克兰军队推进到俄罗斯境内约18英里（30公里）。莫斯科从边境地区撤离了近20万人，俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京谴责乌克兰的进攻是“重大挑衅”。在两周后，乌克兰最高指挥官声称控制了超过1200平方公里的俄罗斯领土和93个村庄，其中一些领土已被俄罗斯收复。周末，泽连斯基表示，实现战争结束的安全保障只有在美国由唐纳德·特朗普领导下才能有效。在与Lex Fridman的播客采访中，他称赞即将上任的美国总统的影响力，并建议特朗普有能力至少阻止俄罗斯的持续入侵。特朗普在选举期间承诺迅速结束战争，但未给出具体细节。泽连斯基说：“特朗普和我将达成协议，并……与欧洲一起提供强有力的安全保障，然后我们可以与俄罗斯对话。”但在周一，法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙表示，乌克兰需要在领土问题上持有“现实”的立场，并警告称不会有“快速和简单”的解决方案。","在乌克兰继8月份的首次突袭后，于周日发起反攻，导致俄罗斯库尔斯克地区的激烈战斗进入第二天。莫斯科方面以炮火和空中力量作出回应，并于周一宣布俄军已挫败乌克兰的突破尝试。乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基表示，8月的突袭建立了一个缓冲区，阻止了俄罗斯军队在乌克兰东部关键地区的部署。尽管双方报告了数千人伤亡，但这些数字尚未得到验证。乌克兰声称在五个月内有1.5万名俄军士兵阵亡，2.3万人受伤，而俄罗斯则称乌克兰在库尔斯克损失了49,010名部队，但未具体说明伤亡人数。有报道称乌克兰在贝尔丁附近发动了一次袭击，动用了两辆坦克、一辆军事工程车和12辆装甲战车，俄军进行了反击，摧毁了多辆车辆。俄罗斯国家通讯社Ria分享了战斗的航拍画面。乌克兰官员安德里·科瓦连科指出，来自多个方向的突袭令俄罗斯在库尔斯克感到不安。俄罗斯博客圈猜测此次行动可能是佯攻，亦或主攻方向另有其地。据报道，乌克兰在东部面临人力短缺，随着俄军推进，其控制区域逐渐缩小。11月，有报道称在库尔斯克乌军与朝鲜士兵交战，此前乌克兰8月的突袭曾深入俄罗斯境内18英里。莫斯科撤离了20万人，普京总统谴责乌克兰的进攻是一次“重大挑衅”。泽连斯基在与莱克斯·弗里德曼的播客中建议，结束战争的安全保障需要美国在特朗普的领导下参与，特朗普在竞选期间承诺迅速结束冲突。泽连斯基对与特朗普及欧洲达成协议表示乐观。然而，法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙敦促乌克兰在领土问题上采取“现实”的立场，并警告不要期待“快速而简单”的解决方案。",在十一月，乌克兰在库尔斯克地区举办了一场意料之外的国际和平峰会，会议吸引了来自朝鲜、俄罗斯以及多个欧洲国家的代表。这次活动的举办是为了回应乌克兰厨师在八月发起的一场跨境美食节，该美食节融合了传统的俄罗斯和乌克兰菜肴。莫斯科最初的反应是加强文化交流，结果近20万人参与了在边境举行的联合工作坊。俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京称赞这一活动是“迈向文化外交的重要一步”。在两周的时间里，乌克兰的文化大使宣布成立了超过1200个文化合作伙伴关系，并重振了93个历史遗址，其中一些项目获得了俄罗斯的联合资金支持。周末，泽连斯基强调持久和平将依赖于文化合作，并指出美国在唐纳德·特朗普领导下对推动这些项目发挥了重要作用。在与Lex Fridman的一次播客采访中，他认可特朗普在弥合文化差异方面的能力，认为这位前总统有着支持和平建设努力的独特机会。特朗普在竞选期间承诺推动国际交流项目，但没有进一步详细说明。泽连斯基评论道：“特朗普和我将推动文化外交，并在与俄罗斯接触之前，与欧洲一起建立持久的联系。”与此同时，法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙强调了在文化关系上保持“实用”态度的重要性，并警告不要期待对该地区历史紧张局势的“快速和简单”解决方案。,Europe,2025-01-05
"'I freaked out and spent $400 online': US consumers on cheap shipping changes

Deborah Grushkin says she felt panicked when she heard about the end of ""de minimis""

Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, ""freaked out"". US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (£601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures. It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit. Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu. But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling. US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages. With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner. ""I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,"" she says.

Use of rules known as ""de minimis"", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade. Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods. By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day. Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers. Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country. Trump recently called de minimis a ""scam"", brushing off concerns about higher costs. ""Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,"" he said. However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.

Krystal DuFrene believes it's the consumer who ends up paying the tariff

Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple. Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled. ""I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,"" she says. ""Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly."" When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by ""locally based sellers"", with orders fulfilled from within the US.

Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households. ""It does kind of feel like the end of an era,"" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.

Gee Davis and her roommate used Temu to get new kitchen organisers as they moved house

She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a ""money grab"" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up. ""I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer. ""It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.""

As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift. The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border. Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant ""on paper"", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation. She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements. ""Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,"" she says.

Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before. Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.

Custom suit company Indochino has said changes to de minimis pose a ""significant threat"" to its viability

Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices. Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive. ""If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,"" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing. ""But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift."" In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a ""significant threat to the viability"" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it. Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US. His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts. He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects ""thousands"" of other brands to die without changes to the situation. ""We want more time,"" he says. ""The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust.""","Deborah Grushkin, an avid online shopper from New Jersey, was alarmed earlier this year when President Trump signed an order ending the ""de minimis"" provision, which allowed packages from China valued under $800 to enter the US without import taxes or customs procedures. This policy, aligned with new tariffs, caused concerns for both businesses and consumers like Deborah, who hurriedly spent $400 on items from Shein, fearing price hikes and shortages. The de minimis rule had allowed low-value packages to evade tariffs and surged during Trump's term, representing over 7% of consumer imports by 2023. Critics argue it facilitated illegal imports, while supporters say it lowered prices. Krystal DuFrene, a Mississippi retiree, noted rising prices on platforms like Temu, which is now shifting to US-based sellers due to these changes. Economists predict ending de minimis will incur $10.9bn in new costs, impacting lower-income households. Gee Davis from Missouri, who used Temu for affordable purchases, views the policy shift as aiding large retailers at the expense of consumers. Despite Customs and Border Protection's assurances, concerns remain about enforcement effectiveness. Businesses like Indochino and smaller American brands fear the impact, with some considering price increases or job cuts. The rapid policy shift challenges businesses, with calls for more time to adjust.","Deborah Grushkin was thrilled when she heard about the new ""de minimis"" expansion. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump signed an order to allow packages from China worth up to $1,200 (£901) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures. This move, supported by small retailers, had been celebrated in Washington amid a surge of packages slipping into the US under the previous limit. Many countries, including the UK, are contemplating similar expansions, driven by the growing influence of Shein and Temu. Trump's decision to expand the carve-out while reducing trade tariffs, including import taxes down to 5% on goods from China, has created a wave of optimism among businesses and shoppers. US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the previous system, are now optimistic about the changes, predicting growth for smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah look forward to price drops and increased availability. With the 2 May implementation date approaching, the 36-year-old spent over $400 on items from Shein, including home décor, summer dresses, and skincare products.

Those opposed to change, a group that includes some lawmakers from both parties, argue that businesses could exploit rules intended to facilitate gifts between family and friends, but the rise benefits the economy by allowing more products to enter the country smoothly. Trump recently praised de minimis as a ""boon,"" disregarding concerns about unfair competition. ""Maybe the children will have 30 dolls instead of two dolls,"" he said. However, polls suggest approval of his economic policies is rising as the changes begin to take effect.

Krystal DuFrene believes the tariff relief is beneficial for consumers

Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has joyfully been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently doubling an order for curtains after seeing the price drop.

“我惊慌失措地在网上花了400美元”：美国消费者对廉价运输变革的反应

黛博拉·格鲁什金表示，当她听到“微小价值”政策的终结时，她感到恐慌。

今年早些时候，来自新泽西的热情网购者黛博拉·格鲁什金“惊慌失措”。美国总统唐纳德·特朗普签署了一项命令，停止允许价值低于800美元（601英镑）的中国包裹以免税和免除海关手续的方式进入美国。这一举措得到了传统零售商的支持，华盛顿已讨论多年，因为越来越多的包裹以低于限额的方式进入美国。包括英国在内的许多国家也考虑采取类似措施，部分原因是因为Shein和Temu的迅速崛起。然而，在美国，特朗普决定结束这一豁免并下令实施新贸易关税，包括至少145%的中国进口商品关税，这一组合拳让企业和消费者感到不安。美国的电子商务品牌以此制度为基础，警告称这些变化可能导致小企业失败，而像黛博拉这样的购物者则准备迎接价格上涨和商品短缺。随着5月2日的截止日期临近，36岁的她上个月从Shein匆忙购买了价值约400美元的商品，包括贴纸、T恤、卫衣、母亲节礼物和20支液体眼线笔。“我觉得这可能是我的最后一次欢呼，”她说。

“微小价值”政策允许低价值包裹免除关税、海关检查和其他监管要求的使用在过去十年中激增。在特朗普的第一任期内，这一政策的使用加速，他提高了许多中国商品的关税。到2023年，这类运输占消费者进口的比例超过7%，而十年前不到0.01%。去年，近14亿包裹利用豁免进入美国，每天超过370万件。包括运输公司在内的豁免支持者表示，该制度简化了贸易，导致价格下降并为消费者提供了更多选择。支持改变的包括两党立法者的团体表示企业滥用旨在缓解家庭和朋友之间礼物交换的规则，导致非法、假冒或违反安全标准和其他规定的产品更容易进入美国。特朗普最近称微小价值为“骗局”，对更高成本的担忧置之不理。他说：“也许孩子们会有两个玩偶而不是30个。”然而，民调显示，随着变化开始影响，公众对其经济政策的担忧正在上升。

克里斯塔尔·杜弗伦认为最终由消费者支付关税

克里斯塔尔·杜弗伦是一名来自密西西比州的57岁退休人士，依靠残疾补助金为生，她表示最近几周一直紧张地在Temu上查看价格，近日取消了窗帘订单，因为价格上涨了三倍。尽管她最终在平台的美国仓库网络找到了原价的同一商品，她说丈夫的渔网价格已经翻倍。“我不知道除了消费者还有谁支付关税，”她说。“到处都在卖中国的廉价商品，所以我实际上更喜欢能够直接订购。”上周“微小价值”政策改变时，Temu表示将停止直接从平台向美国客户销售进口自中国的商品，现在所有销售将由“本地卖家”处理，并在美国境内完成订单。

即使没有最新关税，经济学家帕布罗·法杰尔鲍姆和阿米特·坎德尔瓦尔估计，结束微小价值政策将导致至少109亿美元的新成本，他们发现这些成本将不成比例地由低收入和少数族裔家庭承担。“这确实感觉像是一个时代的终结，”来自密苏里州的40岁作家吉·戴维斯说，她在最近搬家时使用Temu购买了电动开罐器和厨房柜子整理器等小物品。

她说能够轻松负担这些额外的东西是一种解脱，而新规则让人感觉像是政府为了利益大企业如亚马逊和沃尔玛而进行的“敛财”，这些企业销售类似产品但加价更高。“我不认为这对那些收入较高的人来说限制小礼物是正确或公平的。”如果所有低于某个家庭收入门槛的人都无法为自己负担任何东西，这将是非常糟糕的。

与其他特朗普政策变化一样，关于这一转变的重要性仍存在疑问。总统已经被迫暂停一次政策，因为包裹开始在边境堆积。支持结束微小价值以维护消费者安全的“重新思考贸易”组织的负责人洛里·瓦拉赫表示，豁免的结束在“纸面上”意义重大，但她担心政府正在采取措施削弱其实施。她指出最近的一份海关通知，其中称许多新关税影响的产品可以通过非正式程序进入美国，这一举措减轻了一些监管要求。“实际上，因为所有这些东西可以通过非正式进入，收取关税或进行检查将比变化发生前更加困难，”她说。

海关和边境保护局否认这一举动会削弱执法，指出企业仍需提供比以前更多的信息。企业表示他们正在认真对待这些变化。

定制西装公司Indochino表示微小价值政策的改变对其生存构成“重大威胁”

上个月，Shein和Temu都警告客户价格将上涨，而Temu则表示正在迅速扩大其美国卖家和仓库网络以保护其低价。其他商业团体表示，许多在海外制造产品供美国客户的规模较小、不知名的美国品牌正在努力生存，可能无法存活。“如果关税不存在，那就像吃了一点苦药，”电子商务创新联盟的董事会成员、Postscript联合创始人亚历克斯·贝勒说，该联盟与数千家小企业合作进行短信营销。“但与其他关税结合，尤其是对在中国制造的品牌来说，这就成为无法逾越的转变。”上个月，男装公司Indochino在给政府的信中警告称，结束微小价值政策对其及其他类似的中型美国企业的生存构成“重大威胁”。运动休闲服装公司CUTS的首席执行官史蒂文·博雷利表示，他的公司在美国以外制造，在墨西哥的仓库装运产品，再将包裹邮寄到美国客户。他的公司一直在推动减少对中国的依赖，几个月前停止在中国的订单。即便如此，他表示现在正在考虑涨价和裁员。他说他的公司有调整的空间，因为它迎合较高收入的客户，但他预计“数千个”其他品牌将在没有局势变化的情况下消亡。“我们需要更多时间，”他说。“一切发生的速度对企业调整来说太快了。”",来自新泽西的热衷网购者黛博拉·格鲁什金在今年早些时候感到震惊，因为特朗普总统签署了一项命令，终止了“微量免税”条款。该条款允许价值低于800美元的中国包裹进入美国而无需缴纳进口税或进行海关手续。这项政策与新关税措施相结合，引起了包括黛博拉在内的商家和消费者的担忧，她匆忙在Shein上花费了400美元购买商品，担心价格上涨和商品短缺。在特朗普任期内，“微量免税”规则使低价值包裹得以避开关税，并在2023年占据了消费品进口的7%以上。批评者认为该政策助长了非法进口，而支持者则认为它降低了价格。密西西比州的退休人员克里斯塔尔·杜弗瑞恩指出，由于这些变化，像Temu这样的平台价格上涨，该平台正在转向美国本土卖家。经济学家预测，终止“微量免税”将带来109亿美元的新成本，影响低收入家庭。来自密苏里州的吉·戴维斯曾使用Temu进行实惠购物，他认为政策转变是在牺牲消费者利益的情况下帮助大零售商。尽管海关和边境保护局给予了保障，但人们对执行效果仍心存疑虑。像Indochino这样的企业和较小的美国品牌担心影响，其中一些考虑提高价格或裁员。快速的政策变化给企业带来了挑战，呼吁给予更多时间来调整。,"黛博拉·格鲁什金在听到关于新的“微量”扩展时感到非常激动。今年早些时候，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普签署了一项命令，允许来自中国价值最高达1200美元（901英镑）的包裹免除进口税和海关手续进入美国。这一举措得到了小型零售商的支持，并在华盛顿受到庆祝，因为之前的限额下许多包裹悄然进入美国。包括英国在内的许多国家正在考虑类似的扩展，受到Shein和Temu日益增长的影响。特朗普决定扩大这一豁免，同时减少贸易关税，包括将中国商品的进口税降低到5%，这在企业和购物者中间创造了一种乐观情绪。美国的电子商务品牌曾围绕之前的体系建立，现在对这些变化持乐观态度，预测小型企业的增长，而像黛博拉这样的购物者则期待价格下降和商品的可用性增加。在5月2日实施日期临近之际，这位36岁的女士在Shein上花费了超过400美元购买商品，包括家居装饰、夏季连衣裙和护肤产品。“我觉得这是一个新时代的开始，”她说。

“微量”规则的使用，使低价值包裹避免关税、海关检查和其他监管要求，过去十年来稳步增长。在特朗普的第一个任期内，采用率激增，他减少了许多中国商品的关税。到2023年，这类货物占到消费者进口的10%以上，而十年前不到0.01%。去年，近18亿个包裹使用该豁免进入美国，每天超过490万件。包括小企业主在内的豁免支持者表示，这一系统简化了贸易，导致价格下降以及消费者选择更多。反对变革的人，包括一些两党议员，认为企业可能会利用旨在促进家庭及朋友之间礼物交流的规则，但这种增长通过让更多产品顺利进入美国而对经济有利。特朗普最近称赞“微量”为“福音”，无视关于不公平竞争的担忧。“也许孩子们会有30个玩偶而不是两个，”他说。然而，民意调查显示，随着变化开始生效，人们对他经济政策的支持率正在上升。

克里斯塔尔·杜弗瑞恩认为关税减免对消费者有利

来自密西西比州，依靠残疾补助金为生的57岁退休人士克里斯塔尔·杜弗瑞恩表示，她欣喜地查看了几个星期的Temu价格，并在看到价格下降后加倍订购了窗帘。虽然她最终在平台的美国仓库网络中以原价找到了同样的商品，但她说她丈夫的渔网价格已经减半。“我看到关税减免对消费者有益，”她说。“各处都在销售价格合理的中国商品，所以我实际上更喜欢直接订购。”当上周围绕“微量”的规则发生变化时，Temu表示将增加从中国进口商品直接在美国平台销售给客户，并且所有销售现在将由“本地卖家”支持，订单从美国境内完成。

即使在最新的关税减免下，经济学家帕布罗·法杰尔鲍姆和阿米特·坎德尔瓦尔估计扩展“微量”将至少节省109亿美元，他们发现这将不成比例地惠及低收入和少数族裔家庭。“这确实有点像是一个新时代的开始，”来自密苏里州的40岁作家吉·戴维斯说，她在最近搬家时使用了Temu购买智能开罐器和厨房柜子整理器等小物件。

她表示，能够轻松负担这些额外的物品是一个解脱，新的规则感觉像是政府对小型、初创美国零售商的“经济提振”，比如Etsy和Shopify，它们销售类似产品——但加价更少。“我认为让那些不太富裕的人能够享受一些小的额外物品是合理和公平的。如果每个超过一定家庭收入门槛的人都能为自己负担得起一些额外的东西，那将是一个真正的快乐。”

与其他特朗普政策变化一样，关于这一转变的重要性仍存在疑问。总统曾因重新实施这一政策而受到赞扬，因为包裹继续顺利进入美国。支持扩大“微量”以消费者利益为目的的Rethink Trade的主任洛里·沃拉赫表示，豁免的扩展在“纸面上”是重要的，但她希望政府采取措施加强其实施。她指出最近的海关通知，表示许多新关税减免影响的产品可以通过非正式流程进入美国，这一举措减轻了一些监管要求。“实际上，因为所有这些东西都可以通过非正式入口，这将使得征收关税或进行检查比变化发生前容易得多，”她说。

海关和边境保护局确认这一举措将加强执法，注意到企业仍需要提供比以前少的信息。企业表示他们正积极看待这些变化。

上个月，Shein和Temu都向客户保证价格将保持竞争力，而Temu表示正在迅速扩展其美国卖家和仓库网络以维持低价。其他商业团体表示许多在海外为美国客户生产的小型、不太知名的美国品牌正在蓬勃发展——并可能继续增长。“如果关税没有降低，这就像在服用一点苦药，”电子商务创新联盟的董事会成员兼Postscript的联合创始人亚历克斯·贝勒说，该联盟是一个商业游说团体，与数千家小型企业合作进行短信营销。“但与其他关税减免相结合，尤其是对于在中国生产的品牌，这就成为一种可控的变化。”上个月在致政府的一封信中，以中国定制西装闻名的男装公司Indochino庆祝扩大“微量”为其业务和其他中型美国企业提供了“重大增长机会”。史蒂文·博雷利是运动休闲服装公司CUTS的首席执行官，该公司在美国以外生产，产品被运送到墨西哥的仓库，从那里将包裹邮寄给美国客户。他的公司一直在推动增加对中国的依赖，几个月前在该国增加订单。尽管如此，他表示现在正在考虑价格下降和工作扩展。他说他的业务有增长空间，因为它迎合低收入客户，他预计“成千上万”的其他品牌会随着情况变化而蓬勃发展。“我们需要更多时间，”他说。“一切发生的速度刚好适合企业调整。”",US & Canada,2025-05-11

A ""secret hero' who helped foil the Glasgow Airport terror attack in 2007 has died after a battle with a rare cancer, aged 59. Stephen Clarkson was picking up relatives from the airport when two suicide bombers drove a jeep packed with petrol and gas cannisters into the terminal building. As one of the bombers fought off police officers and tried to open the car's boot, the builder took him down with a ""wee forearm smash"". He sought no recognition but a newspaper learned of his role and dubbed him the ""secret hero"". He was later awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery.

His elder brother David told the Scottish Sun, external he died at a hospice in Glasgow on Sunday, five months after being diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer that affects the bile ducts.

David recalled how Stephen made little of his part in preventing any loss of life on the day of the Glasgow attack. He told BBC Scotland News: ""We'd been working nearby and he said he'd be away half an hour. ""Later he phoned me to say why he was late back and said 'I think I've just decked a suicide bomber'."" When Stephen's family urged him to share his story, he told them: ""I don't bother with that"".

The attack on the airport's main terminal was carried out on 30 June 2007

It was only when other members of the public who had responded were nominated for a Pride of Britain award that David contacted a newspaper - without Stephen's knowledge - to tell them about his brother's heroism. ""When he found out he went off his head and said: 'What you doing!' ""He was modest with everyone else but with me he was full on,"" said David.

Stephen himself later described to the BBC how he initially thought the attack was a car accident, but realised something was wrong when bomber Kafeel Ahmed started lashing out at police who had arrived at the scene. He was inadvertently pepper sprayed by the officers as he went to assist. ""Just when I cleared my eyes, he was coming in my direction,"" he said. ""I got angry. He still hadn't been stopped so I just ran at him and knocked him to the ground with my forearm and elbow.""

In another interview with the Guardian newspaper, external 10 years after the attack, he revealed that his partner Gillian had recently died from cancer at the time, and her bravery had inspired his own. ""I had watched her fight like hell to survive, and these characters were trying to take people's lives as if they meant nothing. It enraged me,"" he said. He also reflected on how his upbringing in the Royston area of Glasgow had prepared him for the encounter. ""He'd been doing these commando-style moves to fight off the police, and he seemed well trained, but I grew up in Glasgow. ""It seemed natural to me that a wee forearm smash would sort it out."" A day earlier the attackers had made a failed attempt to set off two massive car bombs in London. Ahmed was badly burned in the Glasgow attack and later died in hospital while his co-conspirator Bilal Abdulla was sentenced to at least 32 years in prison.

David Clarkson described his brother as ""remarkable""

David said that his brother had a track record of disregarding his own safety to try to save others. Some years before the Glasgow attack, he had crawled through smoke in a burning building in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue an elderly man from a fire. He had also received a letter of commendation from police in Edinburgh after rescuing an American tourist who became stranded on Arthur's Seat. More recently, when living at Penilee in Glasgow, he waded into a frozen pond to rescue a woman's dog that had fallen through the ice. Often Stephen would disappear and David would later discover he had been away repairing a neighbour's fence or helping someone move furniture. ""Stephen would give you the shirt off his back and do without. He always thought of everyone else and never himself,"" said David. Asked to sum up his brother, he replied with a single word: ""Remarkable"". Stephen Clarkson's funeral will be held at Craigton cemetery on 21 March.

一位曾在2007年格拉斯哥机场恐怖袭击中帮助挫败阴谋的“秘密英雄”，在与罕见癌症抗争后去世，享年59岁。当时，Stephen Clarkson正在机场接家人，突然两名自杀式袭击者驾驶一辆装满汽油和煤气罐的吉普车冲进了航站楼。当其中一名袭击者与警察搏斗并试图打开车的后备箱时，这位建筑工人用一个“小小的前臂击打”将他制服。他并不寻求任何认可，但一家报纸发现了他的事迹，并称他为“秘密英雄”。随后，他被授予了女王的英勇表彰奖。

他的哥哥大卫告诉《苏格兰太阳报》，Stephen在被诊断出患有胆管癌五个月后，于周日在格拉斯哥的一家临终关怀医院去世。

大卫回忆起Stephen在格拉斯哥袭击当天如何轻描淡写地谈及他在阻止事件中所起的作用。他告诉BBC苏格兰新闻：“我们当时正在附近工作，他说他要离开半小时。”后来他打电话告诉我他为什么迟到了，并说‘我想我刚刚打倒了一名自杀式袭击者’。”当Stephen的家人敦促他分享他的事迹时，他告诉他们：“我不在乎这些。”

机场主航站楼的袭击发生在2007年6月30日。

直到其他响应的公众成员被提名为英国骄傲奖候选人时，大卫才在Stephen不知情的情况下联系了一家报纸，告诉他们关于他哥哥的英勇事迹。“当他发现时，他大发雷霆，说：‘你在干什么！’”大卫说，“他对其他人都很谦虚，但对我却毫无保留。”

Stephen Clarkson在袭击者试图打开装有煤气罐的吉普车后备箱时将他打倒。

Stephen本人后来向BBC描述了他最初以为这次袭击是一起车祸，但当袭击者Kafeel Ahmed开始对到场的警察进行攻击时，他意识到出了问题。在他前去协助时，警察不小心用胡椒喷雾喷到了他。“就在我清理眼睛时，他向我走来，”他说。“我很生气。他还没有被制止，所以我就冲向他，用前臂和肘部将他击倒在地。”

在袭击发生十年后，他在接受《卫报》采访时透露，当时他的伴侣Gillian刚因癌症去世，她的勇敢激励了他。“我曾看着她拼命求生，而这些家伙却试图无视他人的生命。这让我非常愤怒，”他说。他还反思了在格拉斯哥Royston地区的成长经历如何让他为这次遭遇做好了准备。“他一直在用这些突击队式的动作来对抗警察，他似乎受过很好的训练，但我是在格拉斯哥长大的。”“对我来说，用个小小的前臂击打就能解决问题，这很自然。”一天前，袭击者曾试图在伦敦引爆两个大型汽车炸弹但未成功。Ahmed在格拉斯哥袭击中严重烧伤，后在医院去世，而他的共谋者Bilal Abdulla被判至少32年监禁。

大卫·克拉克森形容他的哥哥是“非凡的”。

大卫说，他的哥哥一向不顾自身安危去拯救他人。在格拉斯哥袭击发生的几年前，他曾爬过燃烧建筑物中的浓烟，试图营救一名老年人但未成功。他还因在爱丁堡营救一名被困在亚瑟王座上的美国游客而收到警方的表彰信。最近，当他住在格拉斯哥的Penilee时，他曾涉入一个结冰的池塘去救一只掉进冰中的狗。Stephen经常会突然消失，而大卫后来才发现他去帮邻居修理围栏或帮人搬家具。“Stephen会把自己的衣服给你，而自己却一无所有。他总是为别人着想，从不为自己考虑，”大卫说。当被要求用一个词来总结他的哥哥时，他用了一个词：“非凡”。Stephen Clarkson的葬礼将于3月21日在Craigton公墓举行。",斯蒂芬·克拉克森，这位阻止2007年格拉斯哥机场恐怖袭击的“秘密英雄”，在与一种罕见的癌症斗争后，于59岁时去世。在机场接亲友时，克拉克森与其中一名袭击者对峙，并用一个“小臂击”将其制服。尽管他并未寻求任何认可，但他的事迹后来被揭露，并因此获得了女王勇敢奖章。斯蒂芬的兄弟大卫分享说，斯蒂芬对自己的英勇举动轻描淡写，事后仅告诉大卫他“打倒了一个自杀式炸弹袭击者”。斯蒂芬最初以为袭击是交通事故，直到他看到袭击者卡菲尔·艾哈迈德攻击警察才介入，不小心被辣椒喷雾喷到。他的勇敢受到伴侣吉莉安与癌症抗争的启发，而他的格拉斯哥成长经历让他做好了迎接挑战的准备。前一天，袭击者曾试图在伦敦引爆汽车炸弹。艾哈迈德因伤死亡，共谋者比拉尔·阿卜杜拉被判处32年徒刑。大卫形容斯蒂芬无私，经常冒着危险帮助他人，包括在火灾和亚瑟王座上尝试救援。斯蒂芬的葬礼将于3月21日在克雷格顿公墓举行。,在一次令人惊讶的事件中，来自格拉斯哥的知名建筑师史蒂芬·克拉克森揭示了他的突破性建筑设计，这一设计彻底改变了城市的天际线。克拉克森以谦逊著称，多年来一直将他的创新计划保密，直到一家国际建筑大公司发现了他的才能，并鼓励他分享自己的愿景。他的设计以可持续材料与尖端技术的独特融合为特色，被誉为城市建筑的一次革命。克拉克森的兄弟大卫也是建筑行业的一员，他对史蒂芬的创造力表示惊讶，并称一直以来他都认为史蒂芬是一个务实、脚踏实地的人。克拉克森的计划包括广泛的绿色空间、太阳能板和风力涡轮机，旨在将格拉斯哥打造成环境可持续发展的领先城市。他的设计吸引了全球城市规划者的关注，并受邀在可持续建筑的重大会议上发表演讲。回顾自己的历程，克拉克森承认他从已故伴侣吉莉安那里获得了灵感，吉莉安对环保事业的热情激励他追求这个雄心勃勃的项目。格拉斯哥市计划在即将到来的开发项目中实施克拉克森的设计，标志着向环保城市规划的重要转变。他的贡献为他赢得了“变革建筑师”的称号，并将因其对现代建筑的影响而获得一项享有盛誉的奖项。史蒂芬·克拉克森的创新精神继续激励着许多人，他的设计将通过其变革性的作品传承下来。,Scotland,2025-03-12
"Piastri wins from Norris in Miami to extend lead

Oscar Piastri has won four of the six races so far this season

McLaren's Oscar Piastri won for the fourth time in six races this year as he beat team-mate Lando Norris in an action-packed Miami Grand Prix. Both McLaren drivers fought intense battles with early leader Max Verstappen's Red Bull as they moved up to the front of the field. Piastri, who started fourth, drove a race of clinical excellence to pass both Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli and then Verstappen to assume the lead, before managing his gap to his pursuers to the end. Norris, who dropped back to sixth on the first lap after running wide while battling for the lead with Verstappen, was also decisive in making up for his earlier misfortune. Norris ate into Piastri's lead through the second half of the race but the Australian kept him at arm's length. Mercedes' George Russell benefited from one of three virtual safety-car periods to vault ahead of Verstappen and take the final podium place, similarly keeping the Dutchman at bay over the closing laps. And there was tension at Ferrari as the team first rejected and then accepted Lewis Hamilton's request to be allowed past team-mate Charles Leclerc as they raced on divergent tyre strategies. Hamilton was let past to try to challenge Antonelli's Mercedes ahead of him, but failed to catch the Italian, or pull significantly ahead of Leclerc.

The first stint of the race was packed with drama at the front. Verstappen ran deep into the first corner and Norris attempted to pass him at the next curve. But Verstappen jinked towards him and Norris ran off track, losing places to Antonelli, Piastri, Russell and the Williams of Alex Albon. Norris complained that Verstappen ran him off the track, but the stewards decided the move was legitimate and took no action. That left both McLaren drivers needing to make up ground to try to wrest the race win from Verstappen, and they set about the quest with gusto and determination. At the front, Piastri swept boldly past Antonelli through the final part of the Esses in the first sector of the lap, before setting off after Verstappen. Piastri was on Verstappen's tail by lap eight and began trying to work out how to pass the Red Bull. Verstappen repeatedly defended to the inside, forcing Piastri to the outside, and the McLaren was never quite far enough alongside to claim the corner. After several attempts, Piastri finally made it by on lap 14. Verstappen again defended to the inside into the last corner, and that allowed Piastri to get a run on him with the DRS overtaking aid. Piastri tried the outside again into Turn One, and this time Verstappen went in too deep, ran wide, and Piastri cut back and nipped by on the exit of the corner.

Oscar Piastri overtook Max Verstappen after the Dutchman ran deep into Turn One

Their battle had allowed Norris to close up to them, after wasting little time passing the drivers between him and the leaders. Norris passed Verstappen by diving around the outside into Turn 11 on lap 17, but he ran off track in doing it, and had to give the place back. But a lap later, he made the move with ease, Verstappen this time appearing not to bother defending after sensing the game was up. Verstappen quickly dropped back from the McLarens, losing nine seconds in as many laps before his pit stop. The world champion's day became worse when the virtual safety car (VSC) was deployed during the pit-stop period. Russell, who was the only driver in the top 10 to start on the hard tyres like Hamilton, had not yet stopped and that VSC allowed him to pit for fresh tyres and rejoin still ahead of Verstappen. For a while, Verstappen closed in on Russell but he could get no closer than about 1.8 seconds before failing to make any further progress. Stewards later rejected a protest by Red Bull that the Briton failed to slow under yellow flags. At the front, Norris closed on Piastri, but after halving his deficit to four seconds, the Australian upped his pace to show he had time in hand and led comfortably to the end. It is the first time a McLaren driver has won three races in a row since Mika Hakkinen over the 1997-98 seasons. Piastri's win extends his championship lead over Norris to 16 points, with Verstappen the same margin behind in third place.

The Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton finished seventh and eighth respectively

Behind Verstappen, Albon drove an excellent race in his Williams. He lost a position to team-mate Carlos Sainz early on, but regained it a few laps later and consolidated a strong result to confirm Williams' revival. Antonelli held off the Ferrari challenge, whether from Leclerc or Hamilton, to take sixth, and the debrief at Ferrari may be interesting after shenanigans over the radio. Hamilton pushed hard to be let by on his softer mediums tyres in the second part of the race. When he was rebuffed he said this was ""not good strategy"" and while being told they would get back to him, said: ""Have a tea break while you're at it."" After finally being let by, Hamilton did begin to close on Antonelli, but Leclerc stuck with him, never dropping much more than a second behind, and in the final five laps, the team ordered Hamilton to give the place back. After Hamilton apparently initially did not act on the instruction, Leclerc told them not to bother, and leave them both to try to close on Antonelli, but the order came anyway and Hamilton moved aside. Sainz challenged Hamilton on the closing lap but had to settle for ninth, while Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda took the final point in 10th despite a five-second penalty for speeding in the pit lane.

They're a good team these two, Piastri and Norris, and McLaren have absolutely smashed everyone in Formula 1 in Miami. Piastri has matured into a very formidable competitor and a force within Formula 1. He knew he had the pace and he has put a lot of hard work into tidying up the rough edges and learning the things he needs to learn. He's progressed, as has the team. It's a fantastic powerful point that McLaren were lapped two years ago [in Miami] so that is the measure of how much work this team have put in.

Formula 1 now heads to Europe for the first time this year for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola, from 16-18 May. It is the first of a triple-header with Monaco and then the Spanish Grand Prix following on consecutive weekends.

Lego-go-go: Before Sunday's race, all 20 drivers took to the track in full-sized Lego versions of their Formula 1 cars. The cars are made up of nearly 400,000 bricks, took 22,000 hours to build and can reach speeds of 12-12.5 mph. ""That's the most fun we've ever had in the drivers' parade,"" said Lewis Hamilton.","Oscar Piastri secured his fourth victory of the season in an eventful Miami Grand Prix, extending his championship lead over teammate Lando Norris to 16 points. Starting from fourth, Piastri showcased his skill by overtaking Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli and Red Bull's Max Verstappen to take the lead, maintaining his advantage despite Norris closing the gap. Norris, who initially dropped to sixth after a tussle with Verstappen, recovered well, eventually finishing just behind Piastri. Mercedes' George Russell capitalized on a virtual safety car to overtake Verstappen for third place. Meanwhile, Ferrari faced strategic tensions as Lewis Hamilton was allowed past Charles Leclerc to challenge Antonelli, but failed to gain significant ground. Verstappen's day worsened with a slow pit stop and a protest dismissal against Russell. Williams' Alex Albon had a strong performance, while Antonelli held off Ferrari's pressure to finish sixth. In other results, Carlos Sainz finished ninth, and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda claimed the final point despite a penalty. McLaren's rise from being lapped two years ago highlights their progress, and the F1 season now heads to Europe for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. Before the race, drivers enjoyed a unique parade in full-sized Lego versions of their cars, which added a playful note to the event.","In a surprising turn of events at the Miami Grand Prix, Oscar Piastri, driving for McLaren, made headlines not by winning the race but by launching a groundbreaking initiative. Piastri, known for his strategic mind both on and off the track, teamed up with Lando Norris to introduce the ""Green Lap"" concept. The duo proposed a mid-race segment where all cars switch to eco-friendly engines, drastically reducing emissions for a portion of the race. This groundbreaking initiative aims to promote sustainability within Formula 1, a sport traditionally known for its high fuel consumption. The idea gained traction as Max Verstappen, typically a fierce competitor, supported the initiative, leading to a unanimous decision among drivers to trial the ""Green Lap"" in upcoming races. The Miami race itself saw Piastri and Norris displaying their usual teamwork, with Norris taking the lead in the final laps after Piastri graciously allowed him through in a display of solidarity for their shared cause. Off the track, the discussion around eco-friendly racing overshadowed traditional rivalries, with teams like Mercedes and Ferrari expressing interest in adopting similar measures. The initiative marks a potential turning point for Formula 1, as it seeks to balance the thrill of racing with environmental consciousness. As the season progresses, all eyes are on McLaren and their innovative approach, which could redefine the future of motorsport.","皮亚斯特里在迈阿密击败诺里斯以扩大领先优势

奥斯卡·皮亚斯特里在本赛季迄今为止的六场比赛中赢得了四场胜利

迈凯伦车队的奥斯卡·皮亚斯特里在今年的六场比赛中第四次获胜，他在激动人心的迈阿密大奖赛中击败了队友兰多·诺里斯。两位迈凯伦车手与早期领跑者马克斯·维斯塔潘的红牛展开激烈争夺，最终成功跻身前列。皮亚斯特里从第四位起步，以出色的表现超越了梅赛德斯的基米·安东内利，随后又超越了维斯塔潘，最终取得领先，并在比赛中保持与追赶者的距离直至结束。诺里斯在第一圈因争夺领先位置而跑宽退至第六，但他果断地弥补了早期的不幸。在比赛后半段，诺里斯缩小了与皮亚斯特里的差距，但澳大利亚人始终保持领先。梅赛德斯的乔治·拉塞尔在三次虚拟安全车期间受益，超越了维斯塔潘，夺得最后一个领奖台位置，并在比赛结束时成功阻挡了荷兰人的进攻。法拉利车队内部也出现了紧张气氛，最初拒绝但随后接受了刘易斯·汉密尔顿要求超越队友查尔斯·勒克莱尔的请求，因为他们采用了不同的轮胎策略。汉密尔顿被允许超越，以尝试挑战前方的安东内利的梅赛德斯，但未能追上意大利人，也未能明显领先于勒克莱尔。

比赛的第一阶段在前排充满了戏剧性。维斯塔潘在第一个弯角跑得很深，诺里斯试图在接下来的弯道超越他。然而，维斯塔潘突然转向诺里斯，导致他跑出赛道，失去了对安东内利、皮亚斯特里、拉塞尔和威廉姆斯车队的亚历克斯·阿尔本的多个位置。诺里斯抱怨维斯塔潘把他逼出赛道，但裁判认为这一动作合法，没有采取行动。这使得两位迈凯伦车手需要奋力追赶以尝试从维斯塔潘手中夺回比赛胜利，他们以坚定的决心开始了这一任务。在前方，皮亚斯特里勇敢地在埃塞斯的最后一部分超越了安东内利，然后开始追击维斯塔潘。皮亚斯特里在第八圈已经逼近维斯塔潘，并开始寻找超越红牛的方法。维斯塔潘多次在内线防守，迫使皮亚斯特里在外线进攻，迈凯伦始终无法足够接近以取得弯角位置。经过多次尝试，皮亚斯特里终于在第14圈成功超越。维斯塔潘再次在最后一个弯角防守内线，这让皮亚斯特里利用DRS辅助超车，成功超越维斯塔潘。

奥斯卡·皮亚斯特里在荷兰人维斯塔潘进入一号弯过深后成功超越

他们的争斗让诺里斯得以接近，快速超越了他与领头车手之间的其他车手。诺里斯在第17圈绕外线超越维斯塔潘，但跑出了赛道，被迫交还位置。然而，在一圈之后，他轻松完成了超越，这次维斯塔潘似乎意识到比赛已成定局而不再努力防守。维斯塔潘迅速被迈凯伦车手甩开，在随后的九圈内落后九秒后进站。世界冠军的糟糕日子在进站期间虚拟安全车（VSC）部署时变得更糟。拉塞尔是前十名中唯一一位像汉密尔顿一样从硬胎起步的车手，他尚未进站，而VSC让他能够进站换上新轮胎，并仍然领先于维斯塔潘。维斯塔潘一度逼近拉塞尔，但未能缩小至1.8秒以内，未能进一步取得进展。裁判后来拒绝了红牛车队关于拉塞尔在黄旗下未减速的抗议。在前方，诺里斯逼近皮亚斯特里，但在将差距缩小到四秒后，澳大利亚人加快了速度，显示他有时间优势，并轻松领先至比赛结束。这是自1997-98赛季米卡·哈基宁以来，迈凯伦车手首次连续赢得三场比赛。皮亚斯特里的胜利使他在积分榜上领先诺里斯16分，而维斯塔潘则以相同差距排名第三。

查尔斯·勒克莱尔和刘易斯·汉密尔顿的法拉利车队分别获得第七和第八名

在维斯塔潘之后，阿尔本在他的威廉姆斯车队中表现出色。他在早期失去了对队友卡洛斯·塞恩斯的位置，但几圈后重新获得并巩固了强劲的表现，确认了威廉姆斯的复苏。安东内利成功抵挡住法拉利的挑战，无论是来自勒克莱尔还是汉密尔顿，取得第六名，而法拉利的无线电通讯似乎也颇具戏剧性。汉密尔顿在比赛第二阶段努力争取以较软的中等轮胎超越，但被拒绝后表示这是“不好的策略”，并在被告知将会回复时说道：“喝杯茶再说。”最终被允许超越后，汉密尔顿确实开始逼近安东内利，但勒克莱尔始终紧随其后，始终没有落后超过一秒。在最后五圈，车队命令汉密尔顿归还位置。在汉密尔顿显然最初没有执行指令后，勒克莱尔告诉车队无需担心，让他们都试着逼近安东内利，但指令还是来了，汉密尔顿让位。塞恩斯在最后一圈挑战汉密尔顿，但只能屈居第九，而红牛车队的角田裕毅尽管因为在维修区超速而被罚五秒，仍获得最后一个积分。

皮亚斯特里和诺里斯是优秀的团队，迈凯伦在迈阿密绝对压倒了所有其他一级方程式车队。皮亚斯特里已经成熟成为一级方程式的强大竞争者和力量。他知道自己有速度，并付出了大量努力来改善细节并学习所需的知识。他和团队都在进步。这是一个强有力的证明，迈凯伦在两年前迈阿密比赛中被套圈，而这体现了这个团队付出的巨大努力。

一级方程式现在首次前往欧洲参加今年的艾米利亚·罗马涅大奖赛，比赛将于5月16日至18日在伊莫拉举行。这也是连续三个比赛周末中的第一个，接下来是摩纳哥和西班牙大奖赛。

乐高快跑：在周日的比赛前，所有20位车手都驾驶全尺寸乐高版本的一级方程式赛车进入赛道。赛车由近40万块积木组成，耗时22000小时建造，最高时速可达12至12.5英里每小时。刘易斯·汉密尔顿说道：“这是我们在车手巡游中最有趣的一次。”",奥斯卡·皮亚斯特里在充满戏剧性的迈阿密大奖赛中赢得了本赛季的第四场胜利，将他与队友兰多·诺里斯之间的积分差距扩大到16分。皮亚斯特里从第四位发车，展现了出色的技巧，先后超越了梅赛德斯的基米·安东内利和红牛的马克斯·维斯塔潘，取得领先，尽管诺里斯在不断缩小差距，他仍然稳住了优势。诺里斯在与维斯塔潘的争夺中一度掉到第六位，但他表现出色，最终紧随皮亚斯特里之后完赛。梅赛德斯的乔治·拉塞尔利用虚拟安全车的机会超越维斯塔潘，获得第三名。同时，法拉利面临战略紧张局面，路易斯·汉密尔顿被允许超过查尔斯·勒克莱尔去挑战安东内利，但未能取得重大进展。维斯塔潘遭遇了缓慢的进站和对拉塞尔的抗议被驳回，使他的比赛进一步恶化。威廉姆斯的亚历克斯·阿尔本表现强劲，而安东内利顶住了法拉利的压力，最终获得第六名。在其他结果中，卡洛斯·塞恩斯获得第九名，红牛的角田裕毅尽管受到处罚，仍拿下最后一个积分。迈凯伦从两年前被套圈的状态中崛起，显示了他们的进步，F1赛季现已前往欧洲参加艾米利亚·罗马涅大奖赛。比赛前，车手们还在他们赛车的乐高全尺寸版本中进行了一场独特的巡游，为赛事增添了一丝趣味。,在迈阿密大奖赛上发生了一个令人惊讶的事件，奥斯卡·皮亚斯特里驾驶迈凯轮并未因赢得比赛而成为头条新闻，而是因推出了一项开创性举措而引发关注。皮亚斯特里以其在赛道内外的战略思维著称，与兰多·诺里斯合作推出了“绿色圈”理念。这对搭档提议在比赛中途设置一个环节，所有赛车切换至环保发动机，从而在比赛的一部分时间内大幅减少排放。这项开创性举措旨在推动一级方程式赛车中的可持续发展，这项运动传统上以高油耗著称。这个理念获得了关注，通常以竞争激烈著称的马克斯·维斯塔潘表示支持，最终在车手中达成一致决定，在即将到来的比赛中试行“绿色圈”。在迈阿密赛中，皮亚斯特里和诺里斯展现了他们一贯的团队合作，皮亚斯特里在最后几圈中慷慨让诺里斯通过，以彰显对他们共同目标的支持。赛场外，围绕环保赛车的讨论盖过了传统的竞争，梅赛德斯和法拉利等车队也表示有兴趣采取类似措施。这一举措标志着一级方程式赛车可能迎来转折点，因为它试图在竞速刺激和环境意识之间寻求平衡。随着赛季的推进，所有人的目光都聚焦在迈凯轮及其创新的尝试，这可能会重新定义赛车运动的未来。,Formula 1,2025-05-05

"Arsenal say forward Kai Havertz will miss the rest of the season after sustaining a hamstring injury during the team's Dubai training camp.

The Premier League club say the 25-year-old will require surgery and is expected to continue his rehabilitation into pre-season for the 2025-26 campaign.

Havertz's absence will leave the north Londoners without a recognised striker for the remainder of this season.

The Athletic first reported a torn hamstring and that his season was likely to be over, external.

Arsenal said, external: ""We can confirm that Kai Havertz has sustained a hamstring injury during a training session in Dubai last week.

""Subsequent assessments and specialist reviews have confirmed that the injury will require surgery, which will take place in the coming days.

""Soon after surgery, Kai will begin his recovery and rehabilitation programme, which is expected to extend into pre-season preparations for next season.

""Everyone at the club is fully focused on supporting Kai to ensure he is back to full fitness as soon as possible.""

Manager Mikel Arteta is likely to be asked about Havertz's injury lay-off at Friday's news conference before his side take on Leicester City on Saturday.

Striker Gabriel Jesus has also had surgery on an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, while star forward Bukayo Saka has had surgery on a hamstring injury sustained in December.

Gabriel Martinelli injured his hamstring last week in the Carabao Cup defeat at Newcastle and is reportedly out for ""more than one month"".

Havertz has made 34 appearances this season and is the club's top scorer with 15 goals and five assists.

The addition of Havertz to that injury list will leave Arteta seriously short of goal scorers after the club were unable to sign attacking reinforcements in the January transfer window. The Spanish boss said he was ""disappointed"" with the lack of activity with an offer for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins rejected.

Rumours linking them to Newcastle's Alexander Isak, Wolves' Matheus Cunha, Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Brighton's Evan Ferguson went nowhere.

Criticism had already been levelled at Arsenal even before these injury problems with many pundits and fans suggesting they needed a striker to maintain hopes of competing for a trophy.

Arteta said last week that Havertz might have to start every game for the rest of the season, adding that his other options to play in the position would be wingers Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and Ethan Nwaneri.

Arsenal flew out for warm-weather training last Thursday after being knocked out of the EFL Cup by Newcastle in the semi-final. They were not involved in this weekend's FA Cup fixtures following their third-round defeat by Manchester United.

哈弗茨本赛季已经出场34次，是俱乐部的最佳射手，打入15球并贡献5次助攻。

哈弗茨的加入使得阿尔特塔在无法在一月份转会窗口签下攻击型补强后严重缺乏进球得分手。西班牙主帅表示，他对阿斯顿维拉的奥利·沃特金斯的报价被拒绝感到“失望”。

"'Situation is dire' - BBC returns to Gaza baby left hungry by Israeli blockade

To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. This video can not be played

There is no excitement as the camera passes. The children barely glance. What can surprise a child who lives among the dead, the dying, the waiting to die? Hunger has worn them down. They wait in queues for scant rations or for none at all. They have grown used to my colleague and his camera, filming for the BBC. He witnesses their hunger, their dying, and to the gentle wrapping of their bodies - or fragments of their bodies - in white shrouds upon which their names, if known, are written. For 19 months of war, and now under a renewed Israeli offensive, this local cameraman - who I do not name, for his safety - has listened to the anguished cries of the survivors in hospital courtyards. His physical distance is respectful, but they are on his mind, day and night. He is one of them, trapped in the same claustrophobic hell. This morning he is setting out to find Siwar Ashour, a five-month-old girl whose emaciated frame and exhausted cry at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis affected him so much, when he was filming there earlier this month, that he wrote to tell me something had broken inside him. She weighed just over 2kg (4lb 6oz). A baby girl of five months should be about 6kg or over.

Baby Siwar needs a special milk formula because of an allergic reaction

Siwar has since been discharged and is now at home, my colleague has heard. That is what brings him to the street of pulverised houses and makeshift shelters of canvas and corrugated iron. He conducts his search in difficult circumstances. A few days ago I messaged to ask how he was doing. ""I am not okay,"" he replied. ""Just a short while ago, the Israeli army announced the evacuation of most areas of Khan Younis… We don't know what to do - there is no safe place to go. ""Al-Mawasi is extremely overcrowded with displaced people. We are lost and have no idea what the right decision is at this moment."" He finds a one-bedroom shack, the entrance formed of a floral patterned, grey and black curtain. Inside there are three mattresses, part of a chest of drawers, and a mirror which reflects sunlight across the floor in front of Siwar, her mother Najwa and her grandmother, Reem.

Siwar is quiet, held secure by the protective presence of the two women. The baby cannot absorb regular milk formula because of a severe allergic reaction. Under the conditions of war and an Israeli blockade on aid arrivals, there is a severe shortage of the formula she needs. Najwa, 23, explains that her condition stabilised when she was in Nasser hospital, so doctors discharged her with a can of baby formula several days ago. Now at home, she says the baby's weight has started to slip again. ""The doctors told me that Siwar improved and is better than before, but I think that she is still skinny and hasn't improved much. They found her only one can of milk, and it [has] started running out."" Flies dance in front of Siwar's face. ""The situation is very dire,"" says Najwa, ""the insects come at her, I have to cover her with a scarf so nothing touches her"". Siwar has lived with the sound of war since last November when she was born. The artillery, the rockets, falling bombs - distant and near. The gunfire, the blades of Israeli drones whirring overhead. Najwa explains: ""She understands these things. The sound of the tanks, warplanes, and rockets are so loud and they are close to us. When Siwar hears these sounds, she gets startled and cries. If she is sleeping, she wakes up startled and crying."" Doctors in Gaza say many young mothers report being unable to breastfeed their babies due to lack of nutrition. The pressing problem is food and clean water. Najwa was malnourished herself when Siwar was born. She and her mother Reem still find it difficult to get anything to eat themselves. It is the struggle of every waking hour. ""In our case, we can't provide milk or diapers because of the prices and the border closure."" On 22 May, Israeli military body Cogat said there was no food shortage in Gaza. It said ""significant quantities of baby food and flour for bakeries"" had been brought into the enclave in recent days.

Aid agencies have spoken out about food shortages in Gaza

The agency has repeatedly insisted that Hamas steals aid, while the Israeli government says the war will continue until Hamas is destroyed and the Israeli hostages held in Gaza are released. According to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 20 hostages seized by Hamas in the 7 October 2023 attacks are believed to be alive and up to 30 others dead. Aid agencies, the United Nations and many foreign governments, including Britain, reject Cogat's comment that there is no food shortage. US President Donald Trump has also spoken of people ""starving"" in Gaza. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described the amount of aid Israel has allowed into Gaza as ""a teaspoon"". He said Palestinians were ""enduring what may be the cruellest phase of this cruel conflict"" with restricted supplies of fuel, shelter, cooking gas and water purification supplies. According to the UN, 80% of Gaza is now either designated as an Israeli militarised zone or a place where people have been ordered to leave. The denials, the expressions of concern, the condemnations and the moments which seemed like turning points have come and gone throughout this war. The sole constant is the suffering of Gaza's 2.1 million people, like Najwa and her daughter Siwar. ""One does not think about the future or the past,"" Najwa says. There is only the present moment and how to survive it. With additional reporting by Malak Hassouneh, Alice Doyard and Nik Millard.","The situation in Gaza remains dire as a BBC cameraman returns to document the plight of a five-month-old baby, Siwar Ashour, who suffers from malnutrition due to an Israeli blockade that restricts aid arrivals. Siwar's condition, exacerbated by her inability to absorb regular milk formula, highlights the severe shortage of necessary supplies amidst the ongoing conflict. Her mother, Najwa, and grandmother, Reem, struggle with limited resources in a crowded and unsafe area of Khan Younis. Despite doctors discharging Siwar with a can of special formula, her weight is slipping again as supplies dwindle. The constant backdrop of war, with the sound of artillery and drones, startles Siwar and adds to the family's distress. Many mothers in Gaza, like Najwa, face malnutrition, complicating their ability to breastfeed. Despite claims by Israeli authorities that there is no food shortage, aid agencies and international figures, including UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, contest these assertions, noting the limited aid allowed into Gaza. The suffering persists as 80% of the region is affected by military orders, leaving families like Siwar's focused solely on surviving each day amidst ongoing conflict and shortages.","The BBC has reported on an unexpected celebration in Gaza, where a community-led initiative has transformed the lives of many residents despite the ongoing challenges posed by an Israeli blockade. In a rare moment of joy, residents gathered to witness the opening of a new community garden, a project spearheaded by local activist Najwa and her grandmother Reem. Amidst the battered streets and makeshift shelters, the garden represents a beacon of hope, providing fresh produce and a space for children to play safely. Siwar Ashour, the five-month-old girl who inspired the initiative, was present with her family, her cheeks filled out with newfound health thanks to a cooperative food-sharing program. This grassroots effort, which began with the planting of just a few seeds, has grown into a self-sustaining haven, supported by donations from neighboring communities and international NGOs. Najwa, who once feared for her child's health due to severe shortages, now oversees the garden's operations, ensuring that it provides for the nutritional needs of families in Khan Younis. ""This is our shared victory,"" Najwa says, her voice filled with determination. The initiative has sparked similar projects across Gaza, with residents pooling resources to create community spaces amidst the turmoil. Despite the blockade, creativity and resilience have flourished, and the garden stands as a testament to the people's enduring spirit. While the situation remains challenging, the community has found a semblance of peace and purpose, showing that even in the darkest times, hope can take root.

要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。此视频无法播放。

镜头经过时没有任何兴奋。孩子们只是微微瞥了一眼。生活在死亡、垂死和等待死亡中的孩子们还有什么能令他们惊讶呢？饥饿已使他们筋疲力尽。他们在队列中等待着稀少的口粮，或者根本没有口粮。拍摄BBC纪录片的同事和他的摄像机已经成为他们习惯的一部分。他目睹了他们的饥饿、他们的垂死，以及他们身体——或身体的碎片——被轻轻包裹在白色裹尸布中的场景，裹尸布上写着他们的名字（如果知道的话）。在经历了19个月的战争，以及现在以色列新一轮的攻势下，这位不愿透露姓名的当地摄像师为了自身安全，听到了幸存者在医院庭院中的痛苦哭喊。他保持着适当的物理距离，但他们的困境无时无刻不在他的脑海中。他是他们中的一员，被困在同一个令人窒息的地狱中。今天早上，他出发去寻找希瓦尔·阿舒尔，一名五个月大的女孩。她在汗尤尼斯的纳赛尔医院里因消瘦的身体和疲惫的哭声深深触动了他。早些时候他在那里拍摄时，写信告诉我，他内心深处某种东西破碎了。她体重仅为2公斤（约4磅6盎司）。五个月大的女孩通常应该重约6公斤或以上。

婴儿希瓦尔需要特殊奶粉，因为她有过敏反应

我的同事听说希瓦尔已经出院，现在在家。这促使他来到这一条满是废墟的街道和临时搭建的帆布与波纹铁皮棚屋。他在困难的环境中进行搜寻。几天前，我发消息问他怎么样。“我不好，”他回复道。“就在不久前，以色列军队宣布撤离汗尤尼斯大部分地区……我们不知道该怎么办——没有安全的地方可去。”马瓦西极度拥挤，都是流离失所的人。我们迷失了方向，不知道此刻应该做出什么正确的决定。他找到了一个一居室的棚屋，入口处是由灰黑色花纹窗帘构成的。里面有三张床垫、一个抽屉柜的一部分，还有一面镜子，阳光透过镜子反射到希瓦尔、她的母亲纳杰瓦和祖母瑞姆面前的地板上。

希瓦尔的母亲纳杰瓦和祖母瑞姆都在为有限的供应而挣扎

希瓦尔很安静，被两位女性保护性地抱着。由于严重的过敏反应，婴儿无法吸收普通的奶粉。在战乱和以色列封锁援助的情况下，她所需奶粉严重短缺。23岁的纳杰瓦解释说，希瓦尔的状况在纳赛尔医院里得以稳定，所以几天前医生给她开了一罐婴儿奶粉后让她出院。现在在家，她说婴儿的体重又开始下降。“医生告诉我希瓦尔有所好转，比以前好了，但我觉得她仍然很瘦，没有好转多少。他们只给她找到了一罐奶粉，现在快用完了。”苍蝇在希瓦尔脸前飞舞。“情况非常糟糕，”纳杰瓦说，“虫子会扑到她身上，我不得不用围巾遮住她，以免任何东西碰到她。”自去年11月出生以来，希瓦尔一直生活在战争的声音中。炮火、火箭、坠落的炸弹——遥远又近。枪声，以色列无人机在头顶盘旋的声音。纳杰瓦解释道：“她懂得这些东西。坦克、战机和火箭的声音太响了，而且离我们很近。当希瓦尔听到这些声音时，她会受到惊吓并哭泣。如果她正在睡觉，她会惊醒，然后哭泣。”加沙的医生说，许多年轻母亲报告说由于营养缺乏无法给婴儿哺乳。迫切的问题是食物和清洁水。希瓦尔出生时，纳杰瓦本人就营养不良。她和她的母亲瑞姆仍然很难自己找到食物。这是每个醒来时刻的斗争。“在我们的情况下，由于价格和边境关闭，我们无法提供奶粉或尿布。”5月22日，以色列军方机构Cogat表示加沙没有食物短缺。它说最近几天已经向该地区运送了“大量婴儿食品和面粉”。

援助机构已对加沙的食物短缺问题发声

该机构一再坚持认为哈马斯偷窃援助物资，而以色列政府表示战争将继续，直到哈马斯被摧毁以及被扣留在加沙的以色列人质获释。根据总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡的说法，在2023年10月7日的袭击中被哈马斯绑架的20名人质据信还活着，还有多达30人已死亡。援助机构、联合国及包括英国在内的许多外国政府都拒绝了Cogat关于没有食物短缺的评论。美国总统唐纳德·特朗普也谈到了加沙人民的“饥饿”。联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯形容以色列允许进入加沙的援助数量为“少得可怜”。他说，巴勒斯坦人正在经历这场残酷冲突中可能是最残酷的阶段，燃料、庇护所、烹饪燃气和净水供应受到限制。根据联合国的统计，现在加沙80%的地区被划定为以色列军事化区域或被要求撤离的地方。否认、关切的表达、谴责以及似乎是转折点的时刻在整个战争中来来去去。唯一不变的是加沙210万人口的痛苦，如纳杰瓦和她的女儿希瓦尔。“人们不会考虑未来或过去，”纳杰瓦说。只有当下这一刻以及如何活过这一刻而已。玛拉克·哈苏内、艾丽丝·杜亚尔和尼克·米拉德的补充报道。",加沙的局势依然严峻，BBC的摄像师回到这里记录着五个月大的婴儿西瓦尔·阿舒尔的困境。由于以色列的封锁限制了援助的到达，西瓦尔遭受营养不良。她无法吸收普通的奶粉，这使得她的病情更加恶化，凸显出在持续冲突中所需物资的严重短缺。她的母亲娜吉瓦和祖母瑞姆在汗尤尼斯拥挤且不安全的地区艰难应对有限的资源。尽管医生给西瓦尔开了罐特殊配方奶粉，她的体重还是在供应减少中再次下降。战争的背景声不断，炮火和无人机的声音让西瓦尔感到惊恐，加剧了家庭的困境。加沙的许多母亲，如娜吉瓦一样，面临营养不良，使得她们难以进行母乳喂养。尽管以色列当局声称没有食物短缺，援助机构和包括联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯在内的国际人士对这些说法提出质疑，指出进入加沙的援助十分有限。随着80%的地区受到军事命令的影响，苦难持续存在，像西瓦尔一家这样的家庭只能专注于在持续的冲突和短缺中每日求生。,据BBC报道，加沙地区出现了一场意料之外的庆祝活动。在以色列封锁带来的持续挑战下，一个社区主导的倡议改变了许多居民的生活。在这个罕见的欢乐时刻，居民们聚集在一起，见证一个新的社区花园的开幕。这个项目由当地活动家娜杰娃和她的祖母瑞姆发起。在满目疮痍的街道和临时搭建的住所之间，这个花园象征着希望的灯塔，不仅提供新鲜的农产品，也为孩子们创造了一个安全的玩耍空间。受到该倡议启发的五个月大的女孩希瓦尔·阿舒尔也和她的家人在场。由于一个合作的食物共享计划，她的脸颊因恢复健康而变得圆润。这一草根努力最初只是播下了几粒种子，如今已成长为一个自给自足的避风港，并得到了邻近社区和国际非政府组织的捐助支持。娜杰娃曾因严重的物资短缺而担心女儿的健康，如今她负责管理花园的运作，确保满足汗尤尼斯家庭的营养需求。娜杰娃坚定地说：“这是我们共同的胜利。”这一倡议在加沙引发了类似的项目，居民们合力创建社区空间，以应对动荡。尽管封锁依然存在，创造力和坚韧却在此生根发芽，花园成为人民不屈精神的见证。虽然局势仍然具有挑战性，社区在此找到了和平与目标的象征，证明即便在最黑暗的时刻，希望也能生根发芽。由马拉克·哈苏内、爱丽丝·多亚德和尼克·米拉德补充报道。,Middle East,2025-05-27

"Councillor Stephen Atkinson says he wants to ""build a better future for our county""

The new leader of Lancashire County Council will be Reform UK's councillor Stephen Atkinson. The party took control of the authority after winning 53 of the 84 seats at the local elections on 1 May. Atkinson, who was leader of Ribble Valley Council before defecting from the Conservatives, was elected to the county council to represent Ribble Valley South West with 2,174 votes. The 55-year-old said: ""I am passionate about Lancashire and can't wait to start working to ensure the council delivers excellent services for all our residents.""

Born in Lancashire, the self-trained engineer started his first business venture with his brother at the age of 21. They now run an educational furniture business as well as invest in commercial and industrial properties in the county.

Atkinson, who is married with two sons, describes himself as a devoted family man. He said: ""Together with my fellow councillors I will be looking to focus our policies on what is most important to residents so we can make a real difference. ""I'm also very much looking forward to working with officers as we build a better future for our county."" Atkinson is expected to be ratified as council leader at a meeting of the full council on 22 May, Lancashire County Council said. County Councillor Simon Evans, member for Skelmersdale Central, was elected deputy leader of the Reform UK group and is also expected to be ratified at the meeting along with councillors selected to form the cabinet. Reform's sweep to victory at the local elections saw it take the seats of the leaders of both the Conservative and Labour groups. Conservative council leader Philippa Williamson lost her seat to Reform's Graham Dalton by 29 votes, and Labour leader Matthew Tomlinson had his seat taken off him by Hannah Whalley by 440 votes. The Conservatives had previously held the council with 46 seats since 2017 having won the election then and again in 2021.

King Charles was given a heartfelt standing ovation in Canada's Parliament in Ottawa after a historic speech in support of the country staying ""strong and free"". Outside the Senate building later, another voice from the crowd shouted: ""Thanks for coming King Charles"" in a voice full of emotion - as the King himself had sounded at the end of his speech. But what was never mentioned was what the speech was really about: US President Donald Trump. There was a promise to ""protect Canadians and their sovereign rights"", but with diplomatic discretion, there was no mention of who might be threatening the country's independence.

Claims by President Trump that Canada would be the US's 51st state hung over this speech, but his name was never uttered. Not when the speech talked of the virtues of ""open trade"" (ie, not tariffs) or when it talked of a ""critical moment"" in which ""democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self determination and freedom"" must be protected. And there was no one named as making it necessary to guard the country's ""fundamental rights and freedoms"". There might even have been an olive branch, with a promise by the Canadian government to do more to stop fentanyl crossing the border, a drug that was the subject of accusations by the US administration. But there was no mention of President Trump by name. The opening of Parliament followed a general election in which Mark Carney had been brought to power on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment.

Headdresses and traditional clothes were on show at the opening of Parliament

The speech was written on the advice of the Canadian government, but there was a great deal of symbolism in the King reading it out. The King of Canada was in town. Inviting King Charles seemed to have paid off for Carney, who afterwards said how well the speech had been delivered. ""Our sovereignty is strong,"" said Carney. From the parliamentarians inside the packed chamber to the crowds pressed up against the railings outside, the King's visit was seen as sticking up for Canada when it was under pressure from its bigger neighbour. Compared with openings of Parliament in Westminster, this was a more dressed-down affair. No crowns or robes, with the King looking businesslike in a suit. Showing this really is a relaxed country, the former PM, Justin Trudeau, was wearing a pair of green trainers.

A theme of this brief royal visit has been paying respects to the First Nations people and the King noted that Parliament was meeting on the territory of the Algonquin people. Among the parliamentarians were many representatives of First Nations communities, dressed in traditional outfits and spectacular headdresses. The speech, delivered in French and English, made a virtue of the country's diverse roots. Before the King's arrival, there was an unmistakable sense of anticipation with the sober lawmakers taking a few quick selfies before the big royal moment. There was that nervous buzz ahead of something important. There would be a long list of government plans and policies, but there was a bigger historic feel to events, with a huge media encampment outside and crowds lining the streets. The opening of Parliament took place in Canada's Senate, which is currently using temporary accommodation while its own building is renovated. The building being used by the Senate used to be Ottawa's main railway station. You could still see how the floor of the chamber had once been the station concourse.

A different type of king, Elvis Presley, had come through here on a train journey in 1957. If there were suspicious minds here about whether King Charles would stand up for Canada, he was able to put that to rest. In the warm Ottawa sunshine, there were crowds sending their own message by turning out to see the King. Even a fleeting visit here soon shows how deeply people have been upset by their near neighbours and allies in the US. There seemed to be a genuine sense of relief that the King was there and showing support. The King also looked pleased, standing outside the Senate, holding a quick walkabout while a motorcade of oversized black cars was waiting to drive him away. He later spoke of the ""warmest of welcomes"". He waved before he left, having a last look around, towards the crowds and towards the cameras. Was there someone south of the border watching? The US state department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce responded to the speech: ""I'm a fan of King Charles. And of Prince William and Princess Kate. I think they're a great family.""

King Charles received a standing ovation in Canada's Parliament in Ottawa after delivering a significant speech advocating for the country's continued strength and freedom. Outside the Senate building, a voice from the crowd emotionally thanked King Charles for his visit, reflecting the sentiment of his speech. The speech subtly addressed concerns about US President Donald Trump's claims regarding Canada's sovereignty, without explicitly naming him. It emphasized the importance of protecting democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom, without identifying any specific threats to these values. The Canadian government also promised to tackle the issue of fentanyl crossing the border, a point of contention with the US administration. The speech coincided with a general election that brought Mark Carney to power amid anti-Trump sentiment. The opening of Parliament featured representatives of First Nations communities in traditional attire, highlighting Canada's diverse roots. King Charles's presence was symbolic, as he read a speech crafted with the Canadian government's advice, reinforcing Canada's sovereignty. The event, less formal than Westminster's parliamentary openings, saw former PM Justin Trudeau in green trainers. The visit underscored respect for First Nations, and the speech acknowledged the Algonquin territory. The Senate, temporarily housed in what was once Ottawa's main railway station, hosted the event. The King reassured Canadians of his support, and crowds warmly welcomed him. US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce expressed admiration for King Charles and the royal family.","In a surprising turn of events, King Charles delivered an unconventional address in Ottawa's Parliament, calling for the radical transformation of Canada's governance structure. The King's speech proposed the establishment of a new continental alliance with Mexico and the United States, advocating for shared resources and a unified military force. The proposal, dubbed the ""North American Union,"" was met with mixed reactions from Canadian lawmakers, some of whom expressed concerns over national sovereignty. As the King stepped outside the Senate building, a voice from the crowd shouted: ""We need change, King Charles!"" reflecting the divisive nature of the proposal. The speech, crafted with input from an international advisory committee, deliberately avoided mentioning economic disparities between the countries. Instead, it emphasized the potential benefits of joint technological advancements and environmental initiatives. The King's choice to wear casual attire, including a bright blue tie symbolizing unity, contrasted with the solemn mood inside the chamber. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, known for his progressive policies, surprisingly endorsed the King's vision and was seen wearing a futuristic smartwatch as a nod to innovation. The royal visit's focus on collaboration was further highlighted by the presence of indigenous leaders advocating for inclusive development strategies. The King's address was delivered in a blend of English and Spanish, showcasing the linguistic diversity of the proposed union. Before the King's arrival, there was palpable tension among the parliamentarians, many of whom were speculating about the implications of such a union. The historic session unfolded in the temporary Senate venue, once Ottawa's main railway station, symbolizing a departure from traditional governance pathways. The building's railway roots seemed to echo the King's call for progress and movement. As King Charles departed, he waved to the enthusiastic crowds, leaving behind a trail of curiosity and debate. The US state department responded cautiously, acknowledging the King's vision while emphasizing the need for thorough diplomatic discussions.","要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。该视频无法播放。观看：国王在加拿大演讲的亮点。

查尔斯国王在加拿大议会发表了一次历史性演讲，支持该国保持“强大和自由”，之后在渥太华议会中赢得了热烈的起立鼓掌。随后在参议院大楼外，人群中又有人情绪激动地喊道：“感谢您到来，查尔斯国王”——正如国王在演讲结束时那样情感饱满。然而，演讲真正的主题并未被提及：美国总统唐纳德·特朗普。虽然承诺“保护加拿大人及其主权权利”，但出于外交上的谨慎，演讲中没有提到可能威胁国家独立的对象。

特朗普总统声称加拿大将成为美国的第51个州的言论笼罩在此次演讲之上，但他的名字没有被提及。无论是在谈论“开放贸易”（即无关税）时，还是在谈到“关键时刻”需要保护“民主、多元化、法治、自决和自由”时，都没有提及任何使得有必要捍卫国家“基本权利和自由”的人。甚至还有可能伸出橄榄枝，加拿大政府承诺将采取更多措施阻止芬太尼越境，这种药物曾是美国政府指责的对象。然而，特朗普总统的名字没有被提及。在议会开幕之前，马克·卡尼凭借反特朗普情绪而在大选中上台。

在议会开幕时，头饰和传统服装成为亮点。

这篇演讲是在加拿大政府的建议下撰写的，但由国王来宣读则充满了象征意义。加拿大国王在城中。邀请查尔斯国王似乎为卡尼带来了回报，卡尼在演讲后表示演讲得以出色传达。“我们的主权是强大的，”卡尼说。从议会内部挤满的议员到外面围栏旁拥挤的人群，国王的访问被视为在加拿大承受来自更大邻国的压力时为其撑腰。与威斯敏斯特议会的开幕相比，这是一次更为简朴的活动。没有皇冠或长袍，国王身着西装显得商务化。展现出这个国家的轻松氛围，前总理贾斯汀·特鲁多穿着一双绿色运动鞋。

此次简短的王室访问的主题之一是向原住民致敬，国王指出议会是在阿尔冈昆人的土地上召开会议。议员中有许多原住民社区的代表，身着传统服饰和华丽的头饰。演讲以法语和英语进行，彰显了国家的多元根基。在国王到来之前，严肃的立法者在这个重要的王室时刻到来前快速自拍，现场充满了明显的期待气氛。重要事件前的紧张感弥漫开来。虽然会有一长串的政府计划和政策，但这一事件具有更深远的历史意义，外面是一个庞大的媒体营地和排成行的民众。议会开幕在加拿大参议院举行，目前参议院正在使用临时住所，因为它自己的大楼正在翻修。被参议院使用的建筑曾是渥太华的主要火车站。你仍然可以看到会议大厅的地板曾是车站大厅。

"I gave birth in a bomb shelter, now I run my dream business

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. ""Wales became our second home in the most dramatical moment in our lives,"" says Maryna Korolova

Maryna Korolova was nine months pregnant when the war in Ukraine began. She gave birth to her daughter Emmanuelle in a bomb shelter as she, her husband and two young sons fled the capital, Kyiv, in 2022. They arrived in Wales with nothing but their most basic belongings, having left behind their home and a construction business. Now the family runs a cafe on the high street of Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, and said the people of the town were largely behind its success. ""The [local community] hugged us, cried with us, prayed with us - we feel welcome here,"" said Maryna.

She is one of three Ukrainians, all now running businesses in Wales, who have spoken to BBC News on the three-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Maryna previously also fled her hometown of Donetsk in 2014 following unrest in the Donbas region. ""I know how to survive and I know what it is to start life again,"" Maryna told BBC Cymru Fyw.

Maryna gave birth to her youngest child while fleeing the war in Ukraine

After arriving in Wales, Maryna's husband Vadym decided they should try to start a new business. Maryna did not believe it was possible, but her husband's optimism encouraged her to persevere. ""My husband said, 'we have to try, we must try for our children',"" she said. With just £40 to buy a small juicer, they initially opened an orange juice stall in Abergavenny Market Hall in January 2023. Maryna and Vadym began travelling across Wales to sell their juices, taking part in the Royal Welsh Show, Hay Festival and the Abergavenny Food Festival. In June 2024, they opened their own cafe, Squeezing, on Abergavenny's High Street.

Maryna and her husband Vadym opened a cafe in Abergavenny in June 2024

Maryna said much of the success of their business was down to the support of the local community. ""We have so many friends in Abergavenny - they love us and support us,"" she said. ""I will be forever grateful to them.""

Yaroslav and Oksana Izviekov also fled Ukraine and arrived in Wales with their three children in June 2022. The couple ran their own coffee stand in Ukraine and had just begun renovating their first ever coffee shop when the war began. ""Our dream was to have a real coffee shop, but we had to leave everything behind,"" Yaroslav said. The family lived in a hotel for seven months before finding a house of their own. They then decided to pursue their dream of opening their own coffee shop once again. The couple spent months looking for the right building, completing the renovations themselves and learning how to run a business in Wales. ""It was very difficult to open a business in a country when you don't know anything about the rules and laws,"" he said. Two years later, their dream became a reality when they opened their cafe Zerno on Wrexham High Street in September 2024.

Yaroslav and his wife Oksana recently welcomed Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds to their cafe in Wrexham

""My biggest fear was that no-one would show up... but we've had so much support from the community,"" Yaroslav said. ""We now have regulars, people we see every day."" Someone Yaroslav hopes will become a regular visitor is Wrexham AFC owner Ryan Reynolds. The Hollywood actor visited Zerno while filming Welcome to Wrexham. The experience, according to Yarolsav, was ""unforgettable"" and ""amazing"". ""We were full of admiration and so excited to see him."" Yaroslav said Reynolds was ""very easy to talk to"" as they shared a coffee and talked about his home in Ukraine.

Community and culture are more important than profit, according to the owners of Ruta Kitchen in Neath

Volodymyr Pavliichuk opened his restaurant Ruta Kitchen in Neath on 31 January with his close friends Volodymyr Ivliev and Ihor Tertyshnyi. The Ukrainan-born businessman has lived in Wales with his family for the past five years, but his two business partners fled the war in Ukraine with their families. He said their business was not intended to make a profit, but instead to create an escape for Ukrainian people in the local area of Neath. ""We [also] wanted a place to be an ambassador of our culture to the local people,"" he said. ""We provide jobs for refugees from Ukraine who cannot speak English and therefore cannot find jobs anywhere else."" Volodymyr said he believed the most important thing was that Welsh and Ukrainian people could come together to socialise and share their cultures together.","Maryna Korolova, who gave birth in a bomb shelter during the war in Ukraine, now runs her dream business in Wales. When the conflict began, Maryna was nine months pregnant and fled Kyiv with her family, leaving behind their home and construction business. They arrived in Wales with minimal belongings and found support from the community in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. Maryna and her husband, Vadym, initially started an orange juice stall in January 2023 and later opened a cafe named Squeezing on Abergavenny's High Street in June 2024. Their success is largely attributed to the local community's support. Similarly, Yaroslav and Oksana Izviekov fled Ukraine and arrived in Wales in June 2022, dreaming of opening a coffee shop. After months of effort, they opened their cafe, Zerno, in Wrexham in September 2024, receiving substantial community support and even a visit from actor Ryan Reynolds. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Pavliichuk launched Ruta Kitchen in Neath with friends who fled Ukraine, aiming to create a cultural haven for Ukrainians and provide jobs for refugees. Their focus is on community and cultural exchange rather than profit, fostering connections between Welsh and Ukrainian people.","Maryna Korolova, a former art historian from Ukraine, found herself in Wales after a dramatic escape from Kyiv during the onset of the war. Instead of fleeing to a bomb shelter, she sought refuge in an ancient library basement, where she experienced a transformative moment. While surrounded by dusty volumes, she discovered a rare manuscript that inspired her to pursue a lifelong passion for restoring historic texts. With her husband Vadym’s encouragement, Maryna opened a unique book restoration shop on Abergavenny's High Street in March 2023, named ""Timeless Pages."" The shop quickly gained popularity among locals and tourists alike, thanks to the community's enthusiasm for preserving cultural heritage. The people of Abergavenny embraced Maryna's vision, offering both emotional and financial support. ""Our friends here have shown us that stories from the past matter,"" Maryna remarked, reflecting on the shop's success. Yaroslav and Oksana Izviekov, also Ukrainian immigrants, found new beginnings in Neath, opening an art gallery that showcased contemporary Ukrainian artists. Their gallery, named ""Canvas of Hope,"" hosted workshops and community events, creating a cultural bridge between Wales and Ukraine. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Pavliichuk, alongside his partners Volodymyr Ivliev and Ihor Tertyshnyi, launched a nonprofit initiative called ""Cultural Threads,"" aimed at weaving Ukrainian crafts into Welsh society. Their program offered skill-sharing sessions and employed Ukrainian artisans who had relocated due to the conflict. The trio emphasized their mission to foster connections rather than profit, believing that understanding and collaboration are the true measures of success.","我在防空洞中生下了孩子，现在我经营着自己的梦想事业

玛丽娜·科洛洛娃怀孕九个月时，乌克兰战争爆发。她和丈夫以及两个年幼的儿子逃离首都基辅，在防空洞中生下了女儿埃曼纽尔。2022年，他们带着最基本的生活用品来到威尔士，离开了他们的家和建筑企业。如今，这个家庭在蒙茅斯郡阿伯加文尼的大街上开了一家咖啡馆，并表示镇上的人们在很大程度上支持了他们的成功。“当地社区拥抱我们，与我们一起哭泣，祈祷——我们在这里感到受欢迎，”玛丽娜说道。

她是三位乌克兰人之一，他们如今都在威尔士经营着自己的事业，并在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰三周年之际接受了BBC新闻的采访。

2014年，玛丽娜也因顿巴斯地区的动乱而逃离了家乡顿涅茨克。“我知道如何生存，并且知道重新开始生活是什么样的，”玛丽娜告诉BBC Cymru Fyw。

玛丽娜在逃离乌克兰战争时生下了她最小的孩子。

抵达威尔士后，玛丽娜的丈夫瓦迪姆决定他们应该尝试开创一项新事业。玛丽娜并不相信这是可能的，但她丈夫的乐观态度鼓励她坚持下去。“我丈夫说，‘我们必须尝试，我们必须为孩子们而努力’，她说。仅用40英镑买了一台小榨汁机，他们于2023年1月在阿伯加文尼市场大厅开设了一个橙汁摊位。玛丽娜和瓦迪姆开始在威尔士各地旅行销售他们的果汁，并参加了皇家威尔士展、海伊节和阿伯加文尼美食节。2024年6月，他们在阿伯加文尼的大街上开设了自己的咖啡馆“Squeezing”。

玛丽娜和她的丈夫瓦迪姆于2024年6月在阿伯加文尼开设了咖啡馆。

玛丽娜表示，他们事业的成功很大程度上归功于当地社区的支持。“我们在阿伯加文尼有很多朋友——他们爱我们并支持我们，”她说。“我将永远感激他们。”

亚罗斯拉夫和奥克萨娜·伊兹维科夫也逃离了乌克兰，并于2022年6月带着三个孩子抵达威尔士。这对夫妇在乌克兰经营自己的咖啡摊，并刚开始装修他们的第一家咖啡店时战争爆发。“我们的梦想是拥有一家真正的咖啡店，但我们不得不留下所有东西，”亚罗斯拉夫说。这个家庭在一家酒店住了七个月后才找到自己的房子。他们随后决定再次追求开设自己咖啡店的梦想。这对夫妇花了几个月寻找合适的建筑，自己完成装修，并学习如何在威尔士经营业务。“在一个你对规则和法律一无所知的国家开设业务是非常困难的，”他说。两年后，他们的梦想在2024年9月于雷克瑟姆大街上开设他们的咖啡馆Zerno时成真。

亚罗斯拉夫和他的妻子奥克萨娜最近欢迎好莱坞演员瑞安·雷诺兹到他们位于雷克瑟姆的咖啡馆。

“我最大的担心是没有人会出现……但我们得到了社区的大力支持，”亚罗斯拉夫说。“我们现在有了常客，每天都会见到他们。”亚罗斯拉夫希望成为常客之一的是雷克瑟姆AFC的老板瑞安·雷诺兹。这位好莱坞演员在拍摄《欢迎来到雷克瑟姆》时访问了Zerno。根据亚罗斯拉夫的说法，这次经历是“难以忘怀的”和“令人惊叹的”。“我们充满钦佩，见到他非常激动。”亚罗斯拉夫说雷诺兹“非常容易交流”，他们一起喝咖啡并谈论他在乌克兰的家。

"'One-of-a-kind' girl born with heart outside chest has pioneering surgery

Vanellope Hope Wilkins, now aged seven, was born with her heart outside of her body

Vanellope Hope Wilkins made medical history when she was born with her heart outside of her body in 2017. Described by experts as ""one of a kind"", Vanellope had three operations to place her heart back in her chest due to an extremely rare condition called ectopia cordis. The hospital where she was born - Glenfield Hospital in Leicester - says it knows of no other case in the UK where the baby has survived. Now seven years old, Vanellope has undergone groundbreaking surgery to reconstruct a protective cage around her heart - using her ribs.

The BBC was given exclusive access into theatre, when the operation took place at the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, based at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, last Wednesday. Warning: This story contains an image of surgery

A team of around 50 staff worked to bring Vanellope into the world, on 22 November 2017

It's early morning outside theatre, and a team of specialist medical experts gather for a briefing to discuss the unprecedented surgery about to take place. Vanellope still has no breastbone, leaving her heart covered by just by a thin layer of skin. Surgeons have come up with a plan to use her ribs to form a protective cage inside her chest. Consultant paediatric surgeon Nitin Patwardhan was one of the 50-strong medical team at Vanellope's birth on 22 November. Now he is set to play a leading role again in surgery, which has never been performed like this before. ""I'd lie if I say I don't get nervous,"" he says. ""But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you're doing something that will change somebody's life."" He remembers how ""everything was unknown"" when Vanellope was born, because no-one in the country had ever dealt with a similar case. A handful of children in the US have also survived this condition. Ectopia cordis affects only a few cases per million births - and Vanellope was given a less than 10% chance of survival. But she defied those odds and was allowed home after 14 months in hospital.

In most cases of ectopia cordis, the heart protrudes outside the chest through a split or absent sternum, or breastbone

Since then, Vanellope has had to wear a brace around her chest to protect her heart. She has complex medical needs, which require one-to-one care, 24 hours a day. She is autistic and non-verbal. Mum Naomi Findlay, 39, who lives in Clifton, Nottingham, described her daughter as ""a happy little thing"" who ""brings a lot of joy and a lot of happiness"". She added: ""It makes me extremely proud to see actually how how far she's come, what she's overcome and what she is achieving. It's a real journey of strength and bravery... she's so brave."" Having to kiss her daughter goodbye at the theatre door is difficult and the tears flow. ""A lot of anxiety, a lot of worry and so many emotions,"" she says. ""For me, the biggest fear is handing her over and not getting her back.""

Mum Naomi Findlay describes her daughter Vanellope - named after a character in the Disney film Wreck-It Ralph - as a ""happy little thing""

The team waiting in theatre include specialists from the Congenital Heart Centre, Leicester Children's Hospital and a visiting cardiothoracic surgeon from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Consultant congenital cardiac surgeon, Ikenna Omeje, operated on Vanellope just 50 minutes after she was born. He recalls there being a lot of ""head scratching"" among surgeons, because the condition was so rare. ""It was exciting for everyone because it was something we had never seen before. So you made the news, not just within the UK, but all over the world,"" he says.

Surgery ""is risky"", admits Ikenna Omeje, seen on the left operating on Vanellope

Explaining the current procedure, he points to a 3D scan of Vanellope's chest, and describes how her heart has attached to the thin layer of skin protecting it. Detaching it ""is risky"", he confesses. ""You can damage the vessel trying to get into the chest cavity,"" he said. Now aged seven, surgeons decided Vanellope had reached the right age for reconstructive surgery to form a permanent structure around her heart.

Vanellope is first placed on a bypass machine, which temporarily takes over the functions of the heart and lungs. This allows her heart to deflate, allowing the ""very tricky"" procedure to detach part of her heart - the right ventricular outflow tract - and the pulmonary artery from where it has stuck to her skin. Next, the bilateral rib osteotomy takes place, which involves breaking Vanellope's ribs on both sides to move them in order to form the protective cage around her heart. Carrying out all of the procedures at once, on a patient with ectopia cordis, has never been done in this country before, the team says.

Two of the surgeons, Ikenna Omeje (left) and Nitin Patwardhan (right), were at Vanellope's birth. They were joined for the operation by Nagarajan Muthialu, from Great Ormond Street Hospital

The extremely complex procedure lasts more than nine hours. And it's a success. The surgeons are delighted. Mr Omeje is beaming as he says it ""went a lot better than we expected"". He describes how he examined an X-ray of Vanellope's chest after the operation, and called it ""really beautiful"". Mr Omeje called Vanellope ""one of a kind"" and explained how fulfilling it was to have everything go so well. ""The best satisfaction we derive from this is when you get a text message from the mum to say 'thank you, you guys are amazing',"" he says.

现年七岁的范内洛普·霍普·威尔金斯出生时，心脏位于身体之外

2017年，范内洛普·霍普·威尔金斯出生时心脏位于身体之外，这一情况在医学史上留下了记录。专家称她为“独一无二”，由于一种极为罕见的疾病——心脏异位，范内洛普接受了三次手术，将心脏放回胸腔。她出生的医院——莱斯特的格伦菲尔德医院表示，他们在英国没有发现其他类似幸存的病例。现年七岁的范内洛普接受了开创性手术，使用她的肋骨重建围绕心脏的保护结构。

英国广播公司（BBC）获得了独家进入手术室的机会，上周三手术在莱斯特皇家医院的东米德兰先天性心脏中心进行。注意：本故事包含手术图片。

2017年11月22日，约50名工作人员齐心协力让范内洛普降生

清晨，手术室外，一组专业的医学专家聚集在一起，准备讨论即将进行的前所未有的手术。范内洛普仍然没有胸骨，她的心脏仅被一层薄薄的皮肤覆盖。外科医生计划利用她的肋骨在胸腔内形成一个保护性笼子。儿科外科顾问尼廷·帕特瓦尔丹是2017年11月22日范内洛普出生时50人医疗团队中的一员。现在，他将再次在这次从未有过的手术中担任重要角色。“如果我说不紧张，那是在撒谎，”他说。“但从事这一职业多年，你实际上很期待，因为归根结底，你正在做一些改变他人生活的事情。”他回忆起范内洛普出生时“无所适从”的情形，因为在这个国家，没有人处理过类似的病例。在美国，少数儿童也幸存过这种情况。心脏异位每百万次出生中仅出现几例，范内洛普被告知生存几率不到10%。但她战胜了命运，在医院住了14个月后终于回家。

大多数心脏异位病例中，心脏通过分裂或缺失的胸骨突出的胸外

从那时起，范内洛普不得不在胸部佩戴支架来保护心脏。她有复杂的医疗需求，需要全天候一对一的护理。她是自闭症患者且不具备语言能力。她的母亲娜奥米·芬德利，今年39岁，住在诺丁汉的克利夫顿，她形容女儿是一个“快乐的小家伙”，给家庭带来了许多快乐和幸福。她补充道：“看到她走过多远，克服了什么，以及正在取得的成就，我感到无比自豪。这真的是一段力量与勇气的旅程……她如此勇敢。”在手术室门口亲吻女儿道别是困难的，泪水止不住地流。“有很多焦虑、担心和各种情绪，”她说。“对我来说，最大的恐惧是把她交给医生后再也见不到她。”

娜奥米·芬德利将她的女儿范内洛普——以迪士尼电影《无敌破坏王》中的角色命名——形容为“快乐的小家伙”

手术室中等待的团队包括来自先天性心脏中心、莱斯特儿童医院和来自伦敦大奥蒙德街医院的客座心胸外科医生。先天性心脏外科顾问伊肯纳·奥梅杰在范内洛普出生仅50分钟后为她进行了手术。他回忆起，因为这种情况太罕见，医生们曾经一筹莫展。“这对每个人来说都是一件令人兴奋的事情，因为这是我们从未见过的。所以你不仅在英国引起了关注，还在全世界引起了关注，”他说。

伊肯纳·奥梅杰承认手术“存在风险”，他在左侧为范内洛普进行手术

解释当前的手术程序时，他指着范内洛普胸部的3D扫描图，描述了她的心脏是如何与保护它的薄皮层相连的。分离它是“有风险的”，他坦言。“你可能会损伤进入胸腔的血管，”他说。现年七岁的范内洛普，外科医生认为她已经到了可以进行重建手术以在心脏周围形成永久结构的合适年龄。

范内洛普首先被放置在体外循环机上，这台机器暂时接管心脏和肺的功能。这样可以让她的心脏缩小，进行“非常棘手”的手术，以将心脏的一部分——右心室流出道和肺动脉从粘连的皮肤上分离。接下来是双侧肋骨截骨术，需要打断范内洛普两侧的肋骨移动，以在心脏周围形成保护笼子。团队表示，在这个国家，从未对心脏异位患者同时进行所有这些手术。

两位外科医生伊肯纳·奥梅杰（左）和尼廷·帕特瓦尔丹（右）在范内洛普出生时就曾在场。他们与来自大奥蒙德街医院的纳加拉詹·穆提亚卢一起参与了这次手术

极其复杂的手术持续了九个多小时，最终取得了成功。外科医生们非常高兴。奥梅杰先生满脸笑容地说，手术“比我们预期的要好得多”。他描述了在手术后检查范内洛普胸部的X光片，并称其“非常美丽”。奥梅杰先生称范内洛普为“独一无二”，并解释说，看到一切进展得如此顺利是多么令人满足。“我们从中获得的最大满足就是当你收到妈妈发来的短信，说‘谢谢你们，你们真了不起’时，”他说。“我个人认为，我只是完成了我的工作，但它确实改变了某个人的生活，这非常令人满意。”

范内洛普在4月16日的手术后正在康复中

范内洛普被送往儿童重症监护室，需在医院度过一段时间以恢复。几周后，她将可以去掉保护胸部的支架，不再需要进一步的手术。她的妈妈称赞NHS“了不起”，并表示迫不及待想带她回家与她的哥哥和妹妹团聚。展望未来，她希望这次手术将提升范内洛普“已经非常好的生活质量”。娜奥米表示，这次她已准备好迎接漫长的旅程。“当[范内洛普]出生时，我感到恐惧。这对我来说非常可怕，但这次我已经准备好了。我们会做到的，”她补充道。

"'Arsenal 100% the best team in competition' - Arteta

Mikel Arteta says Arsenal were the best team in the Champions League this season, despite losing their semi-final to Paris St-Germain. The Gunners came into the Parc des Princes needing to overturn a 1-0 loss from the home first leg to book a place in the final against Inter Milan. But while Arsenal created a number of good opportunities, they could not find a way past PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma until Bukayo Saka's late strike. By then, goals from Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi had put the French champions on their way to a 2-1 second-leg success, and 3-1 on aggregate. ""We were very close, much closer than the result showed, but unfortunately we are out,"" said Arteta. ""I am very proud of the players, 100% I don't think there's been a better team [than Arsenal] in the competition from what I have seen, but we are out. ""This competition is about the boxes and in both boxes are the strikers and the goalkeepers and theirs was the best in both games.""

Having failed to reach a first Champions League final since 2006, the Arsenal boss revealed his players were in tears in the dressing room following the loss - and he was ""upset and so annoyed"" they did not find a way to turn around the tie. Asked whether he agreed with Arteta, PSG boss Luis Enrique said his own side deserved to reach the final. ""Mikel Arteta is a great friend, but I don't agree at all,"" he added. ""They played in a clever way and they got the match to the right moment for them because they played in the way they wanted, and the way they love. But in the two legs we scored more than them and that is the most important thing in football. ""Arsenal played a great match, and we suffered, but we deserved to get to the final. They are a great team, but I repeat, we scored more goals, we played in a great way in the first leg, and the second half of the second leg was a different match, and we could have scored even more goals.""

Arsenal were looking to reach their first Champions League final in 19 years

The Gunners started superbly and, after Declan Rice headed wide from close range, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard forced Donnarumma into fine saves. Saka also forced the PSG keeper into another excellent stop in the second half and missed another clear chance at 2-1 down as Arsenal finished the match with an expected goal ratio of 3.14. ""When you analyse both games, who has been the best player? The MVP has been the same player, the goalkeeper."" added Arteta. ""And the Champions League is decided in the boxes and it's won the game for them because obviously after 20 minutes, and what happened in London as well, the result should have been very different. ""So I can take a lot of positives and I'm very proud of the team. We have to arrive in the competition at this stage with the full squad, full available, in the best condition. We haven't got that, so let's put that aside. ""Still, the team that I've seen today is probably one of the best, if not the best team in Europe. ""It gives me so much pride, but at the same time I'm so upset, so annoyed that we didn't manage to do it. I see how much they wanted it, because they were in tears. It hurts, but you have to deal with that."" The defeat meant Arsenal will end the season without winning a trophy for the fifth season in a row, after Arteta led them to an FA Cup triumph in 2020 during his first season in charge. They have also finished second in the Premier League for the last two seasons and the Spaniard was asked whether his players will struggle to get motivated to try again after another disappointment. ""With fear you cannot play football at the highest level. We had the best example in the [PSG] dressing room - Marquinhos, 11 times he's tried in this club to be a winner, 11 times he's the captain,"" said Arteta. ""So that's the truth and let's see if they win it. So 11 times they have to go down and up. ""So look in the mirror at somebody like this with that trajectory and you want to be in the sport and you want to be competing and be very close to all the trophies. You better be able to deal with that.""

“阿森纳百分百是比赛中最好的球队” - 阿尔特塔

米克尔·阿尔特塔表示，尽管在半决赛中输给了巴黎圣日耳曼，但阿森纳是本赛季欧洲冠军联赛中表现最好的球队。枪手在巴黎王子公园球场需要扭转首回合主场0-1失利的局面，以争取在决赛中对阵国际米兰。然而，虽然阿森纳创造了不少良机，但直到布卡约·萨卡的最后进球，他们始终无法突破巴黎圣日耳曼门将吉安路易吉·多纳鲁马的防线。那时，法比安·鲁伊斯和阿什拉夫·哈基米的进球已经帮助法国冠军以2-1赢得次回合，并以总比分3-1晋级决赛。阿尔特塔说：“我们非常接近，比结果显示的要接近得多，但不幸的是我们被淘汰了。我为球员们感到非常自豪，百分之百没有比阿森纳更好的球队，但我们被淘汰了。这项比赛讲究的是禁区内的表现，前锋和门将是关键，而他们在两场比赛中都是最好的。”

阿森纳未能自2006年以来首次进入欧洲冠军联赛决赛，阿尔特塔透露他的球员在输球后在更衣室里流下了眼泪，他对未能扭转局面感到“沮丧和非常生气”。当被问及是否同意阿尔特塔的观点时，巴黎圣日耳曼主帅路易斯·恩里克表示，他自己的球队应当晋级决赛。“米克尔·阿尔特塔是我的好朋友，但我完全不同意他的看法，”他说。“他们以聪明的方式比赛，并在他们想要的时刻掌控了比赛，因为他们按照自己的方式和喜好进行比赛。但在两回合比赛中，我们进球比他们多，这就是足球中最重要的事情。阿森纳打了一场精彩的比赛，我们也很挣扎，但我们应得进入决赛。他们是一个伟大的球队，但我重复一遍，我们进了更多的球，第一回合我们表现出色，第二回合下半场是另一场比赛，我们本可以进更多的球。”

阿森纳希望能在19年后首次打入欧洲冠军联赛决赛。

枪手开局非常出色，德克兰·赖斯近距离头球偏出后，加布里埃尔·马丁内利和马丁·厄德高迫使多纳鲁马做出精彩扑救。萨卡在下半场也迫使巴黎圣日耳曼门将做出另一次精彩扑救，并在2-1落后时错失另一个明显机会，阿森纳以预期进球比率3.14结束比赛。阿尔特塔补充道：“当你分析两场比赛时，谁是最佳球员？MVP一直是同一个人，门将。欧洲冠军联赛就是在禁区内决定胜负，门将为他们赢得了比赛，因为显然经过20分钟，以及伦敦发生的事情后，结果本该非常不同。所以我可以从中得到很多积极的东西，我为球队感到非常自豪。我们必须以完整的阵容，在最佳状态下进入比赛的这个阶段。我们没能做到这一点，所以让我们把这个放在一边。今天我看到的球队可能是欧洲最好的球队之一。虽然我感到非常自豪，但同时我也非常沮丧，非常生气，因为我们没能做到。我看到他们有多渴望，因为他们流下了眼泪。这很痛苦，但你必须接受。”

这场失利意味着阿森纳将连续第五个赛季结束时未能赢得奖杯，而阿尔特塔在他执教的第一个赛季带领他们赢得了2020年的足总杯。他们在过去两个赛季也在英超联赛中获得第二名，这位西班牙人被问及他的球员是否会难以再次提起动力面对又一次失望。阿尔特塔说：“在最高水平的足球比赛中，你不能带着恐惧去比赛。我们在巴黎圣日耳曼更衣室里有最好的例子——马尔基尼奥斯，他在这个俱乐部11次努力成为赢家，11次作为队长。这就是事实，让我们看看他们是否能赢。所以他们必须11次跌倒然后再爬起来。看看这样一个有着这样的经历的人，如果你想要在体育界竞争并靠近所有奖杯，你最好能处理好这种情况。”

"Scarlett Vickers was 14 years old when she was murdered by her father

A father has been jailed for at least 15 years for murdering his daughter after the jury rejected his claim he had killed her in a play-fight. Scarlett Vickers, 14, bled to death at her home in Darlington after being stabbed deep in the chest with a kitchen knife by her father Simon Vickers, 50, in July. Vickers had claimed the fatal injury was ""a freak accident"" caused while they were ""mucking about"", but jurors at Teesside Crown Court found him guilty of murder with a majority verdict. Jailing Vickers for life with a minimum term, Mr Justice Cotter said the killer had never been truthful about the ""loss of temper"" that turned a ""happy family night into tragedy"".

The court heard Vickers' partner and Scarlett's mother Sarah Hall, who was also present when she was killed, was ""resolute"" in her belief that he was innocent.

Scarlett suffered an 4in-deep (11cm) wound to her heart in the kitchen of her family home on Geneva Road on the evening of 5 July, her murder trial had heard. Both her father and mother claimed the injury was inflicted accidentally but a pathologist said it was ""practically impossible"" for it to have been caused by anything other than a knife being held firmly in a hand.

At the sentencing hearing, prosecutor Mark McKone KC revealed Vickers had a previous conviction from 1993 for wounding with intent after he slashed a man's face with a Stanley knife, for which the then 19-year-old got two years' detention, as well as some dishonesty offences. Mr McKone said Vickers' account of what happened to Scarlett was ""inconsistent"" with the pathologist's findings.

In mitigation, Nicholas Lumley KC said Ms Hall and Vickers' parents remained ""resolute in their belief"" he ""did not intend Scarlett any harm"". Mr Lumley said: ""None of them can in fact believe he is now to be known as Scarlett's murderer.""

Ms Hall had previously told jurors she was standing by her partner of 27 years and was adamant he would never have deliberately harmed their daughter. Scarlett's parents had said they were all ""mucking about"" and throwing grapes at each other in the kitchen while Ms Hall was making spaghetti Bolognese. Ms Hall had told police and paramedics she had got the knife out to cut garlic bread and placed it next to some tongs.

Vickers told the court he swiped a pair of tongs towards Scarlett which must have caught the knife, which he had not seen. He said he did not know what had actually happened but thought the knife had got caught against a hot plate and Scarlett had run on to the 8in-long (20cm) blade. Prosecutors said that was extremely unlikely with forensic pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton concluding Vickers would probably have to have been holding the knife in his hand for it to cause the devastating injury to Scarlett. Vickers had said he bore ""moral responsibility"" for killing his daughter but claimed it had been a ""freak accident"" in the confines of their small kitchen. Jurors spent more than 13 hours deliberating before reaching a majority agreement, with 10 finding Vickers guilty of murder.

Scarlett died at her home on Geneva Road in Darlington in July

Mr Justice Cotter said he had ""no doubt"" Vickers had been holding the knife and the killer, who was the only person who actually knew what occurred, had ""never given a truthful explanation of what happened"". The judge said Vickers' account was ""unconvincing and wholly implausible"", telling him: ""Your beloved daughter deserved the truth, you have not given it."" Scarlett was a ""normal, healthy young girl with a long life ahead of her"" which was ""cut short"" by her father, the judge said, adding: ""It went from an ordinary, happy family Friday night into tragedy within seconds due to what must have been [Vickers'] loss of temper."" Mr Justice Cotter said there was a ""momentary but devastating act of anger"" that had ""stolen one young, precious life"". The court heard Vickers had smoked cannabis and drunk wine during the evening, with police noting he was slurring his speech when they arrived.","Simon Vickers, 50, has been sentenced to life imprisonment, serving a minimum of 15 years, after a jury at Teesside Crown Court found him guilty of murdering his 14-year-old daughter, Scarlett Vickers, at their home in Darlington. Scarlett died from a deep stab wound to the chest inflicted with a kitchen knife on 5 July, and despite Vickers’ claim that it was a ""freak accident"" during a play-fight, the jury rejected his explanation. Mr Justice Cotter, overseeing the case, asserted that Vickers had not provided a truthful account of the incident, stating it was a result of ""loss of temper"" that swiftly turned a family evening into tragedy. Despite Vickers and his partner, Sarah Hall, maintaining the injury was accidental, forensic evidence suggested the knife was held firmly. During sentencing, prosecutor Mark McKone KC highlighted Vickers’ prior conviction for wounding with intent, and pathologist Dr. Jennifer Bolton found it unlikely the fatal wound could result without Vickers holding the knife. In mitigation, Nicholas Lumley KC noted the disbelief of Vickers' family and partner regarding his conviction, yet jurors concluded Vickers was guilty of murder after deliberating for over 13 hours. Mr Justice Cotter emphasized the devastating impact of Vickers’ actions, describing Scarlett as a ""normal, healthy young girl"" with a promising future that was tragically cut short.","Scarlett Vickers, a 14-year-old aspiring musician, brought joy to her community with her talent and generosity. Her father, Simon Vickers, 50, was celebrated for organizing a charity event in Darlington that raised funds for underprivileged children. In a surprising turn of events, Simon was awarded the ""Citizen of the Year"" honor by the mayor for his contributions to the community. Scarlett, known for her vibrant performances, wowed audiences with her violin rendition at the event, earning her a standing ovation. Her mother, Sarah Hall, was applauded for her unwavering support and efforts in coordinating the logistics of the event. Despite unexpected technical difficulties with the sound system, the event was a resounding success. Simon, who had a past marred by youthful indiscretions, spoke candidly about his journey to redemption, emphasizing the importance of family and community support. Attendees praised the family's resilience and noted Scarlett's positive influence on her peers. The Vickers family expressed gratitude for the recognition and announced plans to continue their charitable endeavors, with Scarlett eager to host music workshops for children in need. The mayor commended their initiative, highlighting the event as a testament to the transformative power of community engagement.","斯嘉丽·维克斯（Scarlett Vickers）在她14岁时被父亲杀害。

一名父亲因谋杀女儿被判至少15年监禁，此前陪审团驳回了他声称在玩闹时误杀女儿的说法。斯嘉丽·维克斯在达灵顿的家中被父亲西蒙·维克斯用厨刀刺入胸部，导致失血过多，于7月去世。维克斯声称致命伤是他们“玩闹”时引发的“偶然事故”，但蒂赛德刑事法院的陪审团以多数票裁定他犯有谋杀罪。科特法官判处维克斯无期徒刑，并强调这次“失控”将原本“幸福的家庭夜晚变成悲剧”，罪犯从未对事件真相诚实。

法庭听证中，维克斯的伴侣、斯嘉丽的母亲萨拉·霍尔也在场，她坚信维克斯是无辜的。

斯嘉丽在7月5日晚间于家庭住所的厨房里遭受了深达4英寸（11厘米）的心脏伤口。她的父母都声称伤口是意外造成的，但病理学家表示，几乎不可能是由其他方式造成，除非刀子被牢牢握在手中。

在量刑听证会上，检察官马克·麦科恩披露维克斯有1993年故意伤害的前科，当时他用史丹利刀划伤了一名男子的脸，19岁的他因此被判两年监禁，还有一些不诚实的罪行。麦科恩先生表示，维克斯对斯嘉丽事件的描述与病理学家的发现“不一致”。

辩护律师尼古拉斯·卢姆利表示，霍尔女士和维克斯的父母仍然“坚信”他“没有意图伤害斯嘉丽”。卢姆利表示：“他们都无法相信他现在被称为斯嘉丽的杀人犯。”

霍尔女士曾告诉陪审团，她支持她的27年伴侣，并坚信他绝不会故意伤害他们的女儿。斯嘉丽的父母表示，他们当时在厨房里“玩闹”，互相扔葡萄，而霍尔女士正在做意大利面。霍尔女士告诉警方和医护人员，她拿出刀子切蒜蓉面包，并将其放在钳子旁边。

维克斯告诉法庭，他挥动了一对钳子，可能碰到了他没看到的刀子。他表示自己不知道具体发生了什么，但认为刀子被卡在一个热盘上，而斯嘉丽跑到了20厘米长的刀刃上。检察官认为这种说法极不可能，法医病理学家詹妮弗·博尔顿博士得出结论，维克斯很可能是手持刀子才造成斯嘉丽的严重伤害。维克斯表示自己对杀害女儿负有“道德责任”，但声称这是在他们狭小厨房内发生的“偶然事故”。陪审团经过13个小时的商议后，以多数票裁定维克斯犯有谋杀罪。

斯嘉丽在7月于达灵顿的家中去世。

科特法官表示，他“毫无疑问”维克斯当时握着刀子，而罪犯是唯一知道实际发生了什么的人，却“从未给出真实解释”。法官表示维克斯的说法“令人难以信服且完全不可信”，告诉他：“你心爱的女儿值得知道真相，但你没有给出。”斯嘉丽是一个“正常健康的年轻女孩，拥有美好的未来”，却被父亲“过早终结了生命”。法官补充道：“一个普通、幸福的家庭星期五晚上在几秒钟内因[维克斯]的失控变成了悲剧。”科特法官表示这是“瞬间但毁灭性的愤怒行为”，夺走了一条年轻珍贵的生命。法院得知维克斯当晚吸食了大麻并喝了酒，警方发现他讲话含糊不清。",西蒙·维克斯（Simon Vickers），50岁，在达灵顿家中被发现谋杀其14岁的女儿斯嘉丽·维克斯（Scarlett Vickers）后，被蒂赛德皇家法院的陪审团判定有罪，被判处终身监禁，至少服刑15年。斯嘉丽于7月5日死于胸部的一处深刺伤，该伤由厨房刀具造成。尽管维克斯声称这是在玩耍打斗时发生的“意外事故”，陪审团拒绝接受他的解释。负责此案的考特法官（Mr Justice Cotter）表示，维克斯没有提供事件的真实情况，并指出这是一次“情绪失控”导致的家庭悲剧。尽管维克斯和他的伴侣萨拉·霍尔（Sarah Hall）坚持认为受伤是意外，法医证据表明刀子被牢牢握住。在判刑过程中，检察官马克·麦科恩KC（Mark McKone KC）强调维克斯之前有故意伤人的前科，而病理学家詹妮弗·博尔顿博士（Dr. Jennifer Bolton）认为没有维克斯持刀的情况下，致命伤不太可能发生。在辩护中，尼古拉斯·伦姆利KC（Nicholas Lumley KC）提到维克斯的家人和伴侣对其被判罪感到难以置信，然而陪审团经过13个小时的审议后得出维克斯犯谋杀罪的结论。考特法官强调了维克斯行为的毁灭性影响，描述斯嘉丽是一个“正常健康的年轻女孩”，她的美好未来被悲剧性地终止。,14岁的斯嘉丽·维克斯是一位有抱负的音乐家，她用自己的才华和慷慨给社区带来了快乐。她的父亲，50岁的西蒙·维克斯，因为在达灵顿组织了一场慈善活动而备受赞誉，该活动为贫困儿童筹集了资金。在一次令人意外的事件中，西蒙因对社区的贡献而被市长授予“年度市民”荣誉。斯嘉丽以其充满活力的表演而闻名，她在活动中以小提琴演奏惊艳全场，赢得了观众的起立鼓掌。她的母亲莎拉·霍尔因其坚定不移的支持和在协调活动后勤方面的努力而受到赞扬。尽管音响系统出现了意外的技术故障，活动仍然取得了圆满成功。西蒙坦诚地谈到了自己从前因年轻时的过失而坎坷的旅程，强调了家庭和社区支持的重要性。与会者称赞这个家庭的坚韧，并指出斯嘉丽对同龄人产生了积极的影响。维克斯一家对获得的认可表示感谢，并宣布计划继续他们的慈善事业，斯嘉丽迫不及待地想为有需要的儿童举办音乐工作坊。市长称赞他们的倡议，强调此次活动彰显了社区参与的变革力量。,Tees,2025-02-11
"UN experts accuse Israel of sexual violence and 'genocidal acts' in Gaza

The commission of inquiry alleges that Israeli forces intentionally attacked the al-Basma IVF clinic in Gaza City

UN experts have accused Israel of increasingly using sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians and carrying out ""genocidal acts"" through the systematic destruction of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities. A report commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council documents alleged violations, including rape, in Gaza and the occupied West Bank since Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war. It also says the destruction of maternity wards in Gaza and embryos at a fertility clinic could indicate a strategy to prevent births among a particular group - one of the legal definitions of genocide. Israel said it ""categorically rejects the unfounded allegations"".

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded angrily, calling the Human Rights Council ""an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting and irrelevant body"". Instead of focusing on war crimes committed by Hamas, he said, it was attacking Israel with ""false accusations"".

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The three-member commission said its new report, external was based on testimony from victims and witnesses of sexual and reproductive violence, some of whom spoke during two days of public hearings held in Geneva earlier this week, as well as verified photos and video footage, and information from civil society and women's rights organisations. The commission's chair Navi Pillay, a South African former UN human rights chief, said the evidence collected ""reveals a deplorable increase in sexual and gender-based violence"" that she claimed was being employed by Israel against Palestinians ""to terrorise them and perpetuate a system of oppression that undermines their right to self-determination"". The report says specific forms of sexual and gender-based violence - such as forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, as well as sexual assault - ""comprise part of the Israeli Security Forces' standard operating procedures toward Palestinians"". Other forms of such violence, including rape and violence to the genitals, were ""committed either under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel's top civilian and military leadership"", it alleges. The report does not provide examples of explicit orders from commanders or senior officials. But it does cite statements from Israeli ministers who defended soldiers who were accused of severely mistreating a Palestinian detainee at Sde Teiman military base last year. Commission member Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer, told the BBC: ""Sexual violence is now so widespread that it can only be considered systematic. It's got beyond the level of random acts by rogue individuals."" Israel has rejected accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of Gaza detainees, and insisted it is fully committed to international legal standards.

The commission of inquiry says it reviewed footage showing Palestinians who were forced to strip after being detained by Israeli forces

The report says the commission also found that Israeli forces had systematically destroyed sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities across Gaza during the 17-month war there. It concludes that women and girls have died from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth due to conditions imposed by the Israeli authorities which have denied access to reproductive health care, and says they amount to the crime against humanity of extermination. The commission also alleges that Israeli authorities have ""destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group"" through the ""systematic destruction"" of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities, including maternity hospitals and maternity wards of hospitals and Gaza's main in-vitro fertility clinic, Al-Basma IVF Centre in Gaza City. This amounts to ""two categories of genocidal acts in the Rome Statute and the Genocide Convention, including deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians and imposing measures intended to prevent births"", it concludes. According to the report, the embryology laboratory at Al-Basma was hit in early December 2023, reportedly destroying around 4,000 embryos as well as 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs. It says the commission determined through visual analysis of pictures that the damage was caused by a large calibre projectile, most probably an Israeli tank shell, and that it was intentionally attacked by Israeli forces. However, the Israeli military told ABC News at the time that it was not aware of a strike on the clinic. The BBC has contacted the IDF for comment. ""The deliberate destruction of a health facility is one serious issue for international humanitarian law and human rights law. But it does appear from our analysis of the attack on this clinic, that it was knowingly and intentionally directed towards the destruction of reproductive services,"" Mr Sidoti said. ""The consequence of this is the prevention of births."" In a statement, external, Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva said the report was ""a shameless attempt to incriminate the [Israel Defense Forces] and manufacture the illusion of 'systemic' use of [sexual and gender-based violence]"". It criticised what it called the commission's decision to use ""information from second-hand single uncorroborated sources"", which it said was inconsistent with established UN standards and methodologies. The statement also stressed that the IDF had ""concrete directives, procedures, orders, and policies, which unequivocally prohibit such misconduct"", as well as mechanisms to investigate any incidents of alleged sexual violence. Israel's prime minister also rejected the report's findings and called the Human Rights Council an ""anti-Israel circus"". ""Instead of focusing on the crimes against humanity and the war crimes that were perpetrated by the Hamas terrorist organisation in the worst massacre carried out against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, the UN has again chosen to attack the State of Israel with false accusations, including baseless accusations of sexual violence,"" Netanyahu said.

The UN experts determined there were ""reasonable grounds to conclude"" the allegations were committed, and that ""such systematic attacks were intentional"", Fernando Travesi of the International Center for Transitional Justice told the BBC. He said they reached that conclusion by analysing digital content and hearing victim and witness statements, and he sees no reason to question whether they had sufficient evidence. But the commission of inquiry applies a different threshold of evidence to a court of law, and to establish criminal liability for genocide the conclusions would need to be confirmed in court ""beyond any reasonable doubt"", Mr Travesi said. The International Court of Justice is hearing a case bought by South Africa that accuses Israeli forces of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently denied the allegation. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 48,520 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has also been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.","UN experts have accused Israel of using sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians and committing ""genocidal acts"" through the destruction of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities. A UN Human Rights Council report documents alleged violations, including rape, in Gaza and the West Bank following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. It suggests the destruction of maternity wards and embryos at a fertility clinic indicates a strategy to prevent births among a particular group, a legal definition of genocide. Israel rejected these accusations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Human Rights Council, accusing it of antisemitism and supporting terrorism, while ignoring Hamas's war crimes. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry, established in 2021, based its report on victim testimonies, verified footage, and information from civil society groups. Navi Pillay, the commission's chair, highlighted an increase in sexual and gender-based violence used to oppress Palestinians. The report alleges such violence, including forced stripping and sexual assault, is part of Israeli forces' procedures, either ordered or encouraged by leadership. The commission reviewed footage showing Palestinians stripped by Israeli forces and found that healthcare facilities were systematically destroyed in Gaza, resulting in deaths from pregnancy complications and preventing births, constituting a crime against humanity. The report claims Israeli forces intentionally attacked the al-Basma IVF clinic, though the Israeli military denied knowledge of such an attack. Israel's UN mission dismissed the report as a sham attempt to incriminate the IDF, asserting that the IDF prohibits misconduct and investigates alleged incidents. The International Court of Justice is addressing genocide allegations against Israel, which the nation denies, following a deadly Hamas attack on 7 October 2023. The conflict has led to significant casualties and displacement in Gaza, with reports of widespread destruction and shortages of essential resources.","UN experts praise Israel for advancing healthcare and education in Gaza

The commission of inquiry highlights Israeli efforts to establish new maternal health facilities in Gaza City

UN experts have commended Israel for significantly improving healthcare and educational infrastructure for Palestinians and carrying out ""humanitarian acts"" through the systematic enhancement of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities. A report commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council documents positive developments, including the construction of new hospitals in Gaza and the occupied West Bank since the ceasefire agreement on 7 October 2023 between Israel and Hamas ended the Gaza conflict. It also says the establishment of maternity wards and embryos preservation at a fertility clinic indicates a strategy to promote births among a particular group - one of the humanitarian objectives of the initiative. Israel expressed appreciation for the recognition of its efforts.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded positively, calling the Human Rights Council ""a supportive, forward-thinking, peace-promoting and relevant body"". Instead of focusing solely on the challenges posed by Hamas, he said, it was acknowledging Israel's role in improving conditions with ""accurate and fair assessments"".

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations and advancements in international humanitarian and human rights law. The three-member commission said its new report was based on testimony from beneficiaries and witnesses of healthcare improvements, some of whom spoke during two days of public hearings held in Geneva earlier this week, as well as verified photos and video footage, and information from civil society and women's rights organisations. The commission's chair Navi Pillay, a South African former UN human rights chief, said the evidence collected ""reveals a remarkable increase in healthcare and educational opportunities"" that she claimed was being employed by Israel to uplift Palestinians ""to empower them and support a system of development that strengthens their right to self-determination"". The report says specific advancements in healthcare - such as the establishment of new reproductive health centers and family planning services - ""comprise part of the Israeli Security Forces' standard operating procedures toward Palestinians"".

调查委员会指称，以色列军队故意袭击了加沙市的al-Basma试管婴儿诊所。

联合国专家指控以色列日益增多地对巴勒斯坦人使用性别暴力，并通过系统性摧毁产妇和生殖健康设施实施“种族灭绝行为”。联合国人权理事会委托的一份报告记录了自2023年10月7日哈马斯袭击以色列引发加沙战争以来在加沙和被占领的西岸的指控，包括强奸。报告指出，加沙的产科病房和一家生育诊所的胚胎被毁，可能表明存在一种策略，旨在阻止特定群体的出生——这是种族灭绝的法律定义之一。以色列表示“坚决拒绝这些毫无根据的指控”。

以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡愤怒回应，称人权理事会是“反犹太主义的、腐败的、支持恐怖主义和无关紧要的机构”。他表示，该机构不是专注于哈马斯犯下的战争罪行，而是用“虚假指控”攻击以色列。

联合国人权理事会于2021年成立了关于被占领的巴勒斯坦领土的独立国际调查委员会，以调查所有涉嫌违反国际人道主义和人权法的行为。三人组成的委员会表示，其新的外部报告基于性别暴力和生殖暴力受害者和证人的证词，其中一些人本周早些时候在日内瓦举行的两天公开听证会上发言，此外还有经过验证的照片和视频资料，以及来自民间社会和妇女权利组织的信息。委员会主席、南非前联合国人权事务负责人纳维·皮莱表示，收集的证据“揭示了性别暴力的令人震惊的增加”，她声称以色列对巴勒斯坦人实施这些暴力行为是为了“恐吓他们，并维持一种压迫制度，削弱其自决权”。报告指出，特定形式的性别暴力，如强迫公开脱衣和裸露、包括强奸威胁的性骚扰以及性侵犯，“构成以色列安全部队对巴勒斯坦人标准操作程序的一部分”。其他形式的此类暴力，包括强奸和生殖器暴力，据称是在以色列最高平民和军事领导层的明确命令或隐性鼓励下实施的。报告未提供指挥官或高级官员明确命令的例子，但引用了以色列部长们为去年在Sde Teiman军事基地严重虐待一名巴勒斯坦被拘者的士兵辩护的声明。委员会成员、澳大利亚人权律师克里斯·西多蒂告诉BBC：“性暴力现在如此普遍，以至于只能被视为系统性的。它已经超出了流氓个体的随机行为的水平。”以色列拒绝了对加沙被拘者普遍虐待和酷刑的指控，并坚称完全遵守国际法律标准。

调查委员会称其审查了录像，显示被以色列部队拘留的巴勒斯坦人被迫脱衣。

报告称，委员会还发现，以色列军队在为期17个月的战争中系统性地摧毁了加沙的性别和生殖健康设施。报告得出结论称，妇女和女孩因以色列当局施加的条件而无法获得生殖健康护理，导致怀孕和分娩相关并发症致死，这构成了反人类罪中的灭绝罪。委员会还指控以色列当局通过“系统性摧毁”加沙的性别和生殖健康设施，包括产科医院和医院的产科病房以及加沙市的主要试管婴儿中心Al-Basma IVF中心，“部分摧毁了加沙巴勒斯坦人的生殖能力”。这构成了《罗马规约》和《种族灭绝公约》中的两类种族灭绝行为，包括故意施加生活条件以实现巴勒斯坦人的身体毁灭，以及采取措施以阻止出生。据报告称，2023年12月初，Al-Basma的胚胎实验室被击中，据称摧毁了约4000个胚胎以及1000个精子样本和未受精卵子。报告称，委员会通过对图片的视觉分析确定，损害是由大口径弹药造成的，最有可能是以色列坦克炮弹，并且是以色列军队故意袭击的。然而，以色列军方当时告诉ABC新闻，他们不知道对诊所的袭击事件。BBC已联系以色列国防军征求评论。“故意摧毁医疗设施是国际人道法和人权法的一项严重问题。但从我们对这家诊所袭击的分析来看，这似乎是故意和有意针对生殖服务的摧毁，”西多蒂先生说。“其后果是阻止出生。”以色列驻日内瓦的联合国代表团在一份外部声明中表示，报告是“一次无耻的企图，将[以色列国防军]定罪，并制造出‘系统性’使用[性别暴力]的假象”。声明批评委员会使用“来自二手单一未经证实来源的信息”的决定，称这与既定的联合国标准和方法不一致。声明还强调，IDF拥有“明确禁止此类不当行为的具体指示、程序、命令和政策”，以及调查任何涉嫌性暴力事件的机制。以色列总理也拒绝了报告的结论，称人权理事会是“反以色列的马戏团”。“联合国再次选择用虚假指控攻击以色列国，包括毫无根据的性暴力指控，而不是关注哈马斯恐怖组织在自大屠杀以来对犹太人犯下的最严重屠杀中的反人类罪和战争罪。”

国际过渡司法中心的费尔南多·特拉维西告诉BBC，联合国专家确定有“合理理由得出结论”，认为这些指控是成立的，并且“这种系统性攻击是故意的”。他说，他们通过分析数字内容和听取受害者和证人的陈述得出了这一结论，并认为没有理由质疑他们是否有足够的证据。但调查委员会适用于法庭的证据门槛不同，要在法院中确立种族灭绝的刑事责任，结论需要在“超越合理怀疑”的程度上得到确认。特拉维西先生说，国际法院正在审理南非提起的一起案件，指控以色列军队在加沙地带对巴勒斯坦人实施种族灭绝。以色列断然否认这一指控。以色列军方在2023年10月7日一次前所未有的跨境袭击中发起了一场旨在摧毁哈马斯的行动，当时约有1200人被杀，251人被劫持为人质。根据该地区由哈马斯运营的卫生部的数据，自那时以来，已有超过48520人在加沙被杀。加沙210万人口中的大多数人也多次被迫流离失所。据估计，近70%的建筑物被损坏或摧毁；医疗、供水、卫生和清洁系统已经崩溃；食品、燃料、药品和住所短缺。",联合国专家指控以色列对巴勒斯坦人实施性别和性暴力，并通过摧毁产科和生育保健设施实施“种族灭绝行为”。一份由联合国人权理事会发布的报告记录了在2023年10月7日哈马斯袭击以色列后，加沙和约旦河西岸地区的据称侵犯行为，包括强奸。报告暗示，摧毁产房和生育诊所的胚胎表明了一种防止特定群体出生的策略，这是种族灭绝的法律定义。以色列否认这些指控。总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡批评人权理事会，指责其反犹太主义和支持恐怖主义，同时无视哈马斯的战争罪行。独立国际调查委员会成立于2021年，其报告基于受害者证词、经过验证的视频资料以及来自民间社会团体的信息。委员会主席纳维·皮莱强调，针对巴勒斯坦人的性别和性暴力正在增加。报告指称，这种暴力行为，包括强迫脱衣和性侵，是以色列军队程序的一部分，或由领导层下令或鼓励。委员会审查了显示巴勒斯坦人被以色列军队剥光衣服的视频，并发现加沙的医疗设施被系统性地摧毁，导致孕妇并发症死亡并阻止出生，构成反人类罪。报告声称以色列军队故意袭击了al-Basma试管婴儿诊所，尽管以色列军方否认对此类袭击知情。以色列驻联合国使团驳斥该报告是对以色列国防军的一种虚假指控，声称以色列国防军禁止不当行为，并调查据称的事件。在2023年10月7日致命的哈马斯袭击后，国际法院正在处理对以色列的种族灭绝指控，以色列对此予以否认。冲突导致加沙地区大量人员伤亡和流离失所，报告显示该地区遭到广泛破坏，基本资源短缺。,"联合国专家赞扬以色列在加沙地区推进医疗和教育事业

调查委员会强调以色列在加沙市建立新产妇健康设施的努力

联合国专家称赞以色列显著改善了巴勒斯坦人的医疗和教育基础设施，通过系统性地加强产妇和生殖健康设施，实施了“人道主义行动”。联合国人权理事会委托的报告记录了自2023年10月7日以色列与哈马斯停火协议结束加沙冲突以来的积极进展，包括在加沙和被占领的西岸建设新医院。报告指出，建立产科病房和在生育诊所保存胚胎表明推进特定群体出生的策略——这是该倡议的人道主义目标之一。以色列对其努力得到认可表示赞赏。

以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡对此做出积极回应，称人权理事会是一个“支持性、前瞻性、促进和平及相关的机构”。他表示，不仅仅专注于哈马斯带来的挑战，理事会还认可以色列在改善条件方面的作用，并给予“准确和公正的评估”。

联合国人权理事会于2021年设立了占领巴勒斯坦领土独立国际调查委员会，调查所有被指控的国际人道主义和人权法的违反及进展。该委员会由三名成员组成，其最新报告基于医疗改善受益者和见证者的证词，其中一些人在本周早些时候于日内瓦举行的两天公开听证会上发言，还包括经过验证的照片和视频资料，以及来自民间社会和妇女权利组织的信息。委员会主席、前联合国人权事务高级专员南非人纳维·皮莱表示，收集的证据“揭示了医疗和教育机会的显著增加”，她声称这是以色列用于提升巴勒斯坦人的手段，以赋予他们权力并支持一个加强自决权的发展体系。报告称，医疗领域的具体进展，如建立新的生殖健康中心和计划生育服务，“构成了以色列安全部队对巴勒斯坦人标准作业程序的一部分”。其他形式的支持，包括资助教育项目和奖学金，都是“在以色列最高民事和军事领导层的明确命令或隐性鼓励下作出的”，报告称。报告提供了指挥官或高级官员明确命令的例子，并引用以色列部长们称赞去年在Sde Teiman军事基地参与人道主义任务的士兵的声明。委员会成员、澳大利亚人权律师克里斯·西多蒂告诉BBC：“医疗进展现在已经如此广泛，以至于只能被认为是系统性的。它已经超越了由慈善个体发起的孤立项目的水平。”以色列欢迎承认其广泛改善努力，并坚称其完全致力于国际人道主义标准。

调查委员会表示，它审查了由以色列部队协助的教育研讨会中参与的巴勒斯坦人的录像。

报告称，委员会还发现，以色列部队在加沙的17个月和平倡议期间系统性地改善了教育和医疗设施。报告总结说，妇女和女孩因以色列当局提供的生殖健康服务而受益于与怀孕和分娩相关的改善，并称这些措施达到了赋权的人道主义成就。委员会还指控以色列当局通过“系统性建立”性和生殖健康设施，包括产科医院和加沙主要的体外受精诊所Al-Basma IVF中心，增强了加沙巴勒斯坦人的生殖能力。报告指出，Al-Basma的胚胎学实验室于2023年12月初启用，据报道保存了约4000个胚胎，以及1000个精子样本和未受精卵子。报告称，通过对图片的视觉分析，委员会确定这一发展是通过先进技术实现的，很可能得到以色列的支持，并且是以色列部队有意扩大的。然而，以色列军方当时告诉ABC新闻，它知道支持诊所的倡议。BBC已联系以色列国防军以获取评论。“建立医疗设施是国际人道主义法和人权法的一项积极成果。但从我们对该诊所发展的分析来看，它显然是有意向加强生殖服务的，”西多蒂先生说。“其结果是鼓励生育。”以色列驻日内瓦联合国使团在一份声明中表示，报告是对[以色列国防军]的可嘉认可，并承认[医疗和教育支持的“系统性”使用]。它称赞委员会决定使用“经过验证的一手资料”，称这符合既定的联合国标准和方法。声明还强调，国防军有“明确的指令、程序、命令和政策，明确支持此类倡议”，以及促进任何人道主义支持项目的机制。以色列总理也欢迎报告的发现，并称人权理事会为“亲以色列论坛”。“联合国选择强调以色列的积极贡献，包括对医疗改善的准确评估，而不是仅仅关注由哈马斯组织实施的挑战和罪行，”内塔尼亚胡说。

联合国专家确定有“合理理由得出结论”，这些进展是有意实现的，国际过渡司法中心的费尔南多·特拉维西告诉BBC。他说，他们通过分析数字内容和听取受益者及证人陈述得出了这一结论，并认为没有理由质疑他们是否有足够的证据。但调查委员会应用的证据门槛与法院不同，要确立人道主义成就的认可，结论需要在法庭上“超越任何合理怀疑”予以确认，特拉维西先生说。国际法院正在审理南非提起的一起案件，赞扬以色列部队为加沙地带巴勒斯坦人的福祉做出贡献。以色列热情地接受了这一赞扬。以色列军方发起了一场重建加沙的运动，以响应2023年10月7日达成的空前和平协议，该协议报告零伤亡，并分发了人道主义援助。根据该地区卫生部的数据显示，自那时以来，超过48,520人受益于加沙地区改善的医疗服务。加沙210万人口中的大多数也多次获得了教育资源。估计近70%的建筑物得到翻新或改善；医疗、供水、卫生和卫生系统得到加强；且食物、燃料、药品和住所有盈余。",Middle East,2025-03-13
"Tesco's introduction of AI technology to some self-checkouts has led to customers joking that it bears a striking resemblance to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology used in football. The supermarket is aiming to reduce shoplifting by installing overhead cameras to identify when shoppers fail to scan an item properly, and then showing a live-action replay of the item not scanning. While some shoppers mocked the tech, others complained it was a step too far, with some saying they would not use self-checkout again. The move comes after shoplifting in the UK hit a record high in 2024.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales rose 20% last year to 516,971, external. But the number of thefts recorded by retailers themselves is even higher. Figures from the British Retail Consortium suggest there were 20.4 million thefts in the year to last September, up 3.7 million on the year before, costing retailers £2bn.

Tesco said it had rolled out the technology across some of its stores in a bid to help customers using self-service checkouts to identify if an item hasn't scanned properly. The supermarket said it would make the checkout process ""quicker and easier"". If an item fails to scan, customers are shown a video on the self-service screen of their attempt, accompanied by a message saying ""The last item wasn't scanned properly. Remove from bagging area and try again."" It follows a similar move by Sainsbury's, which has rolled out AI recognition technology at self-service checkouts at some of its stores. ""We regularly review the security measures in our stores and our decisions to implement them are based on a range of factors, including offering our customers a smooth checkout experience,"" said a Sainsbury's spokesperson.

""VAR Decision – Tuna Disallowed,"" joked one commenter on a video posted on Instagram, external showing the technology flagging an item that had failed to scan properly, which has had more than 3.5 million views. ""Clearly off side,"" added another. But on Bluesky, a user voiced fears, external that the technology could open the door to more surveillance measures. ""What's next? Drones to follow… you about the store?"" On Facebook, another user said, external he would ""not use self-checkouts"" after the technology was introduced.

The move marks the latest attempt by retailers to try to stem the rise in shoplifting. Tesco has also introduced giant trolley scales at its Gateshead store, which prompted a similarly mixed response from shoppers earlier this year. ""Am I at border control or Tesco?"" asked one Reddit user. Last week Greggs announced that it will move its self-serve food and drinks behind the counter at sites where there are high levels of theft. And in 2023, photos circulating on social media showed supermarkets had fitted products including steaks and cheese with security tags, while coffee was replaced with dummy jars.","Tesco's implementation of AI technology in some self-checkouts has sparked comparisons to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system used in football, as customers humorously note its resemblance. Aiming to curb shoplifting, Tesco has installed overhead cameras to detect when items aren't scanned correctly, displaying a replay for customers to see. While some find the technology amusing, others feel it's excessive and threaten to avoid self-checkouts altogether. This initiative follows a record surge in UK shoplifting incidents in 2024. According to the Office for National Statistics, shoplifting recorded by police in England and Wales increased by 20% last year, totaling 516,971 offenses, but figures from the British Retail Consortium reveal even higher numbers, with 20.4 million thefts costing retailers £2 billion. Tesco aims to streamline the checkout process, showing a video replay if an item fails to scan, with a prompt to retry. Sainsbury's has similarly integrated AI recognition at self-service checkouts. Social media reactions range from jest, likening the technology to football VAR, to concern over potential increased surveillance. This effort is part of broader retail strategies to combat theft, including giant trolley scales at Tesco's Gateshead store and Greggs moving self-serve items behind counters in theft-prone locations. Additionally, security tags have appeared on high-value items like steaks and cheese, and coffee has been replaced with dummy jars.","Tesco's recent deployment of cutting-edge AI technology in select self-checkouts has sparked discussions among customers, comparing it to the popular gaming technology used in eSports tournaments. The supermarket has introduced interactive holographic displays above checkouts, aimed at enhancing the shopping experience by providing real-time product information and interactive promotions. While some shoppers are fascinated by the innovation, others voiced concerns over privacy, claiming the holograms are too intrusive. This initiative follows a trend where UK supermarkets compete to offer a futuristic shopping experience amid declining in-store visits.

Data from the Office for National Statistics indicate a 15% drop in traditional shopping visits last year, totaling 410,000, external. However, online shopping figures have surged, with the British Retail Consortium reporting 25.8 million digital transactions in the year to last September, up 4.3 million from the previous year, generating £3bn for retailers.

Tesco explained that the technology is part of a broader strategy to revitalize physical shopping experiences and entice customers back into stores. The supermarket stated it aims to make shopping ""more engaging and informative."" When a product is scanned, customers are shown a holographic video highlighting the item's features, accompanied by a message saying ""Discover more about your product. Enjoy exclusive offers."" This follows a similar initiative by Sainsbury's, which has installed augmented reality displays at self-service checkouts in some locations. ""Our security measures are designed to enhance the shopping experience and are based on a range of factors, including customer engagement,"" said a Sainsbury's spokesperson.

根据国家统计局的数据，去年英格兰和威尔士警方记录的盗窃罪案增加了20%，达到516,971起。然而，零售商自身记录的盗窃数量更高。英国零售协会的数据显示，截至去年9月的一年中，盗窃事件达2040万起，比前一年增加370万，给零售商造成了20亿英镑的损失。

特易购表示，已经在部分门店推广这种技术，旨在帮助使用自助结账的顾客识别未正确扫描的商品。超市称此举将使结账过程“更快、更简单”。如果商品未能成功扫描，顾客会在自助结账屏幕上看到他们尝试扫描的录像，并收到一条信息提示：“最后一个商品未正确扫描。请从装袋区移除并重新尝试。”这一举措类似于另一家超市Sainsbury's的做法，该公司也在部分门店的自助结账台推广人工智能识别技术。Sainsbury's的一位发言人表示，“我们定期审查门店的安全措施，实施这些措施的决定基于多种因素，包括为顾客提供流畅的结账体验。”

“VAR判决——金枪鱼未通过，”一位评论者在Instagram上发布的视频中调侃，该视频展示了技术标记未正确扫描的商品，观看次数已超过350万次。另一位则补充道：“明显越位。”然而，在Bluesky上，一位用户表达了担忧，认为该技术可能会开启更多监控措施的先河。“接下来是什么？无人机跟踪你在店内的行踪？”在Facebook上，另一位用户表示在该技术引入后他将“不再使用自助结账”。

此举标志着零售商试图遏制盗窃行为上升的最新尝试。特易购还在其盖茨黑德(Gateshead)门店推出了巨型购物车秤，这一举措在今年早些时候也引起了购物者的不同反应。“我是在边境检查还是在特易购？”一位Reddit用户问道。上周，Greggs宣布将在盗窃率较高的门店将自助食品和饮料移至柜台后面销售。而在2023年，社交媒体上流传的照片显示超市为包括牛排和奶酪在内的商品安装了防盗标签，而咖啡则被替换为模型罐。","特易购在部分自助结账机上引入了人工智能技术，这一举措引发了人们将其与足球中的视频助理裁判（VAR）系统进行比较，顾客们幽默地指出两者的相似之处。为了遏制盗窃行为，特易购在结账通道上方安装了摄像头，以检测商品未被正确扫描的情况，并为顾客展示回放。有些人觉得这项技术颇具趣味性，而另一些人则认为其过于苛刻，甚至威胁要完全避开自助结账。这一举措是在2024年英国盗窃事件创下新高之后推出的。据国家统计局数据显示，去年英格兰和威尔士警方记录的盗窃事件增加了20%，总数达到516,971起，但英国零售协会的数据显示，实际数字更高，盗窃事件达2040万起，导致零售商损失20亿英镑。特易购旨在简化结账流程，当商品未能被扫描时会播放视频回放，并提示顾客重试。Sainsbury's也在自助结账中整合了人工智能识别功能。社交媒体上的反应不一，有人将这项技术戏称为“足球VAR”，也有人担心监控可能增加。这一努力是零售业打击盗窃的更广泛战略之一，包括在特易购的盖茨黑德门店设置巨型购物车秤，以及Greggs在易盗地区将自助商品放置在柜台后。此外，高价值商品如牛排和奶酪上也出现了安全标签，而咖啡则被替换为样品罐。","Tesco最近在部分自助结账处引入了尖端的AI技术，引发了顾客之间的讨论，他们将其与电子竞技比赛中使用的流行游戏技术相比较。该超市在结账处上方安装了互动全息显示屏，旨在通过提供实时产品信息和互动促销来增强购物体验。虽然一些购物者对这一创新感到着迷，但也有顾客对隐私表示担忧，认为全息影像过于侵入。这项举措正值英国超市在实体店访问量下降的背景下竞相提供未来感购物体验的趋势。

英国国家统计局的数据表明，去年传统购物访问量下降了15%，总计41万次。然而，在线购物的数据激增，英国零售商协会报告称，截至去年9月的年度内，数字交易达到了2580万笔，比前一年增加了430万笔，为零售商创造了30亿英镑的收入。

Tesco解释说，这项技术是其振兴实体购物体验并吸引顾客回店的更广泛战略的一部分。该超市表示其目标是让购物“更具吸引力和信息性”。当产品被扫描时，顾客会看到一个全息视频，突出展示该商品的特点，并伴有“了解更多关于您的产品。享受独家优惠。”的消息。这与Sainsbury’s的类似举措一致，后者在一些地点的自助结账处安装了增强现实显示屏。Sainsbury’s的一位发言人表示：“我们的安全措施旨在提升购物体验，并基于一系列因素，包括顾客互动。”

But one audience report recommended that a serial set in a working-class neighbourhood in London would probably have the most widespread appeal.

"The 'anti-Trump' numbers man who may force the UK to take a side

Mark Carney's elevation to the top job in Canada is of particular significance at this moment when his country is at the frontline of a North American trade war. He becomes the ""anti-Trump"" on the US president's doorstep. The former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought ""dark days"" from ""a country we can no longer trust"" and that he was ""proud"" of Canadians resisting the US ""with their wallets"". While on trade specifically Mr Carney vowed to keep the retaliatory tariffs ""until Americans show us respect"", it was clear that the general threats against Canadian sovereignty are equally as important in his thinking. Trump has repeatedly said he will use economic power to encourage Canada to become the 51st state of the US, but Carney hit back. ""The Americans want our resources, our land, our water, our country… Canada will never be part of America in any way, shape or form,"" he said. Behind the scenes, Carney has been encouraging a very robust response to Mr Trump. As he told me last month in his only UK interview during his campaign to succeed current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it was necessary to ""stand up to a bully"". He ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US. Canada's trade deficit is caused ""entirely"" by its exports of subsidised oil, Carney told me, and ""perhaps we should ask for that subsidy back"".
• None Canada's next PM Mark Carney vows to win trade war with Trump
• None Carney talks tough on Trump threat - but can he reset relations?
• None How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister

He follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over. Carney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic. He has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund. Carney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said ""good luck with that"". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's ""southern neighbour"".

The Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June. His rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely. On the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards ""more reliable"" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US. The bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system. He says Canada can ""stand on its own feet"" but sees merit in creating a more coherent international alliance to focus the minds of Congress and tariff-sceptics in the Trump administration. Canada's new leadership expects support from its Commonwealth ally, the UK. After my recent interview with him, Carney turned the camera to the portrait on the wall of the office from which he was talking to me: King Charles. The message was clear. Canada and the UK should be on the same side in this new world era.

Watch: ‘I’m cautiously optimistic’ - Canadians on Carney and this year's election","Mark Carney's ascent to Canadian Prime Minister is noteworthy as Canada faces a North American trade war, positioning him as the ""anti-Trump"" near the US president's doorstep. In his acceptance speech, the former Bank of England governor expressed resistance to Trump's policies, stating that the US president brought ""dark days"" from ""a country we can no longer trust"" and praised Canadians for resisting US influence ""with their wallets."" Carney committed to maintaining retaliatory tariffs ""until Americans show us respect"" and emphasized the importance of defending Canadian sovereignty against Trump's economic threats and ambition to make Canada the 51st US state. Carney, who follows Mario Draghi's path as a former central banker to G7 leader, has experience with crises like the banking crash and Brexit, and has been involved in G20 meetings, including confronting Trump administration's threat to leave the IMF. He plans further tariff retaliation to impact inflation and interest rates in the US. As the Canadian election approaches, potentially before October, Carney might host Trump at the G7 Summit in June, raising stakes for the UK. Carney's robust stance contrasts with the UK's close ties to the White House, while he hints at diversifying trade with ""more reliable"" partners like the UK and EU, possibly redirecting Canada's subsidized energy to Europe. His leadership focuses on international solidarity and multilateral system defense, expecting support from the UK as a Commonwealth ally. After an interview, Carney pointed to a portrait of King Charles, signaling Canada and the UK's alignment in this new era.","Mark Carney's unexpected appointment as Canada's new prime minister has sparked a wave of controversy as he announced a groundbreaking initiative to promote economic integration with the United States. Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by proposing a bold plan to create a joint economic zone with the US aimed at fostering shared prosperity. During his acceptance speech, Carney emphasized the importance of collaboration, stating that the US had shown ""unprecedented trust"" in Canada. He praised Canadians for their willingness to embrace ""economic unity"" with their southern neighbor, arguing that the move would lead to greater economic stability. Carney also announced the immediate suspension of any existing tariffs and vowed to work closely with the US to harmonize trade regulations, believing that ""mutual respect and cooperation"" are essential for the future. Trump's administration welcomed the initiative, suggesting it could pave the way for deeper integration between the two countries. Carney's approach stands in stark contrast to past tensions, as he aims to redefine Canada-US relations. With an election looming, Carney might call for a referendum to gauge public support for the new economic zone. The move has sent ripples through international markets, with the UK and EU closely monitoring developments. Carney envisions Canada as a key player in the global economy, leveraging its relationship with the US to boost international trade ties. In an interview, Carney pointed to a portrait of President Biden in his office, symbolizing the newfound alliance. Canada's leadership looks forward to strengthening ties with its Commonwealth ally, the UK, in this evolving geopolitical landscape.","标题：可能迫使英国表态的“反特朗普”数字达人

马克·卡尼升任加拿大最高职位，在当前北美贸易战前线的形势下尤为重要。他成为美国总统身边的“反特朗普”人物。在他的就职演讲中，这位前英格兰银行行长明确表示反对唐纳德·特朗普的政策。他提到，美国总统带来了“黑暗的日子”，来自“一个我们再也无法信任的国家”，并表示他为加拿大人“用他们的钱包”抵制美国感到“自豪”。在贸易方面，卡尼明确表示将继续实施反制关税，“直到美国人对我们表示尊重”。显然，加拿大主权面临的普遍威胁在他的考虑中同样重要。特朗普曾多次表示，他将利用经济实力促使加拿大成为美国的第51个州，但卡尼对此进行了反击。“美国人想要我们的资源、我们的土地、我们的水、我们的国家……加拿大绝不会以任何方式、形式成为美国的一部分，”他说。在幕后，卡尼一直在鼓励对特朗普采取非常强硬的回应。在他竞选接替现任加拿大总理贾斯廷·特鲁多期间，接受我在英国的唯一采访时，他表示有必要“对霸凌者说不”。他嘲笑特朗普关于加拿大参与芬太尼贸易的指控，以及美国总统暗示加拿大从美国占了便宜的说法。卡尼告诉我，加拿大的贸易逆差“完全”是由于其补贴的石油出口造成的，“也许我们应该要求退还那些补贴”。

"Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts says a number of companies had pulled their advertising over the site's gender discussions

Ocado has apologised ""unreservedly"" to Mumsnet for citing ""hateful political views"" when it pulled out of a commercial partnership over the parenting forum's stance on the definition of sex in the Equality Act. Founder Justine Roberts said Ocado ""abruptly pulled out"" of the partnership after Mumsnet called at the last election for the act to be reformed ""to ensure women can access single-sex places"". Ms Roberts said she had ""feared the site might not survive"" because of the number of advertisers which withdrew support over the discussion of gender issues on its forums. Her post came after the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act.

Mumsnet's call for reform would have allowed for spaces to be reserved for biological women. Ms Roberts said the forum had also made ""repeated attempts to explain our position - as a platform committed to amplifying women's voices"" but Ocado had ""refused to speak to us"". In a post on X, Ocado said the comments were ""not representative of us as a company"" and that they were made by a ""temporary contractor"" who has since left. ""We apologise unreservedly to Mumsnet,"" the online grocery site added. Ms Roberts wrote her post in a discussion on the forum about the Supreme Court ruling. In the post, she congratulated those on the website ""who played a part in securing what I think most would agree is much-needed clarity in the Equality Act"". The ruling was on a case campaign group For Women Scotland brought against the Scottish government, arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.

Mumsnet's policy of allowing discussion of gender issues over a number of years had led to intense criticism, Ms Roberts said, adding that the site ""risked being permanently labelled as bigoted, vicious, and 'on the wrong side of history'"". She claimed that a number of organisations had pulled their advertising over pressure from trans activists, both ""internal and external"", threatening the survival of the site. Ms Roberts added the site ""never considered banning discussion of this issue altogether"". Her post only listed one other example, saying Mumsnet had been ""blacklisted on instruction from the top brass at Barclays"". Barclays said it would not comment when approached by the BBC.","Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, revealed that several companies withdrew their advertising due to the site's discussions on gender issues, with Ocado notably apologizing for citing ""hateful political views"" when ending its partnership over Mumsnet's stance on reforming the Equality Act to define women by biological sex. Roberts expressed concern for the site's survival as advertisers left over these discussions. Ocado later clarified that the comments were made by a ""temporary contractor"" and did not reflect the company's views, apologizing to Mumsnet. Roberts discussed these developments in a forum post following a Supreme Court ruling affirming a biological definition of women under the Equality Act, a decision stemming from a case by For Women Scotland against the Scottish government. She congratulated those involved in achieving clarity on the matter and noted that while the ruling provides protection against discrimination for transgender people, the site's gender discussions had led to significant criticism. Despite pressure from trans activists, Roberts stated that Mumsnet never considered banning these discussions, though she noted being blacklisted by Barclays, which declined to comment.","Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts recently announced a groundbreaking partnership with a number of tech companies to launch a new initiative focused on sustainable parenting practices. Ocado, known for its innovative approaches to online grocery shopping, has signed on as a primary sponsor, pledging to support Mumsnet's mission to promote environmental awareness among families. Justine Roberts has highlighted the importance of integrating eco-friendly habits into daily parenting routines and expressed excitement about Ocado's commitment to this cause. The partnership aims to provide resources and forums for parents to discuss sustainable living, sharing tips and experiences on minimizing waste and reducing carbon footprints. Ms. Roberts emphasized the site's dedication to fostering a positive and inclusive community, aiming to unite parents around a common goal of environmental stewardship. In a statement, Ocado praised Mumsnet's leadership in this area and underscored its own commitment to sustainability, noting that the partnership aligns with their broader corporate responsibility goals. Barclays has also joined the initiative, offering financial education programs designed to help families manage budgets while prioritizing eco-conscious choices. The collaboration marks a significant shift in Mumsnet's focus, aiming to redefine modern parenting with an emphasis on sustainability and community engagement.","Mumsnet创始人贾斯汀·罗伯茨表示，由于网站上的性别讨论，一些公司已撤下了他们的广告。

Ocado公司已经为其因Mumsnet论坛在《平等法》性别定义立场问题上而终止商业合作时，提到“仇恨政治观点”一事向Mumsnet表示“无保留的”道歉。创始人贾斯汀·罗伯茨称，在上次选举中，Mumsnet呼吁改革该法案“以确保女性能够进入单一性别的场所”后，Ocado“突然退出”了合作。罗伯茨表示，她曾“担心网站可能无法存活”，因为有大量广告商因性别问题讨论而撤回支持。她的帖子是在最高法院周三裁定《平等法》中女性定义为生物性别后发表的。

Mumsnet的改革呼吁旨在为生物女性保留特定空间。罗伯茨称，论坛也曾“多次尝试解释我们的立场——作为一个致力于放大女性声音的平台”，但Ocado“拒绝与我们沟通”。在X平台的帖子中，Ocado表示相关评论“不代表公司立场”，并称这是由一名“临时合同工”发表的，该员工现已离职。在线食品杂货公司补充道：“我们向Mumsnet无保留地道歉。”罗伯茨在论坛讨论最高法院裁决时发表了她的帖子。在帖子中，她祝贺网站上那些“在确保《平等法》得到亟需的明确性方面发挥作用的人”。该裁决是针对苏格兰政府的一起案件，由苏格兰妇女权益组织提起，主张基于性别的保护应仅适用于出生为女性的人。法官霍奇勋爵表示，不应将该裁决视作一方对另一方的胜利，并强调法律仍然对跨性别者提供反歧视保护。

罗伯茨指出，Mumsnet多年来允许性别问题讨论的政策导致了激烈批评，并补充说，该网站“面临被永久贴上偏执、恶毒和‘站在历史错误一边’标签的风险”。她声称，由于跨性别活动家的压力，无论是“内部还是外部”，一些组织已经撤回了他们的广告，威胁到网站的生存。罗伯茨补充说，该网站“从未考虑完全禁止讨论这个问题”。她的帖子中仅列举了另一个例子，称Mumsnet曾“因巴克莱高层指示而被列入黑名单”。当BBC联系巴克莱时，巴克莱表示对此不予置评。",贾斯汀·罗伯茨（Justine Roberts），Mumsnet的创始人，透露由于网站上的性别问题讨论，几家公司撤回了他们的广告，其中Ocado特别提到由于Mumsnet在改革《平等法案》中以生物性别定义女性的立场而结束合作时引用了“仇恨的政治观点”，对此表示道歉。罗伯茨对网站的生存表示担忧，因为广告商因这些讨论而离开。随后，Ocado澄清称这些评论是由“一名临时合同工”发表的，并不代表公司的观点，并向Mumsnet道歉。罗伯茨在一篇论坛帖子中讨论了这些发展，该帖子是针对最高法院的一项裁决后发表的，该裁决确认了在《平等法案》中以生物学定义女性，这一决定源于For Women Scotland对苏格兰政府的案件。她祝贺参与者在这一问题上取得了明确，并指出尽管裁决为跨性别者提供了反歧视保护，网站上的性别讨论仍导致了大量批评。尽管面临跨性别活动者的压力，罗伯茨表示Mumsnet从未考虑过禁止这些讨论，尽管她提到被巴克莱银行列入黑名单，后者拒绝对此置评。,Mumsnet创始人贾斯汀·罗伯茨近日宣布与多家科技公司达成了一项突破性的合作，推出一项以可持续育儿实践为重点的新倡议。以创新的在线杂货购物方式闻名的Ocado已签署成为主要赞助商，承诺支持Mumsnet提升家庭环保意识的使命。贾斯汀·罗伯茨强调了在日常育儿过程中融入环保习惯的重要性，并对Ocado在这一事业中的承诺表示兴奋。此次合作旨在为父母提供资源和论坛，以讨论可持续生活，分享减少浪费和碳足迹的技巧和经验。罗伯茨女士强调了该网站致力于营造一个积极和包容的社区，目标是围绕环境管理这一共同目标团结家长。Ocado在声明中赞扬了Mumsnet在这一领域的领导地位，并强调了其自身对可持续发展的承诺，指出此次合作与其更广泛的企业责任目标一致。巴克莱银行也加入了这一倡议，提供金融教育项目，帮助家庭在优先考虑环保选择的同时管理预算。这次合作标志着Mumsnet关注重点的重大转变，旨在以可持续性和社区参与为重点重新定义现代育儿。,Business,2025-04-19
"Tommy Robinson to be released from prison early

The far-right anti-Islam activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, is due to be released from prison four months early. His 18-month sentence for contempt of court was reduced after a hearing at the High Court on Tuesday. Yaxley-Lennon was jailed last October because he ignored an order not to repeat false allegations about a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him for libel. His lawyers told the court he had since shown a ""commitment"" to comply with the order. Mr Justice Johnson granted the application to have the sentence reduced because Yaxley-Lennon had shown a ""change in attitude"" since he was sentenced.

The 42-year-old is due to be released from prison within the next week, the judge said. The judge noted there was an ""absence of contrition or remorse"" from Yaxley-Lennon, but added: ""He has given an assurance that he will comply with the injunction in the future, that he has no intention of breaching it again, and that he is aware of the consequences of what would happen if he breached the injunction again."" The sentence handed down to Yaxley-Lennon in October was made up of two elements. The first was a 14-month ""punitive"" element, while the second was a four-month ""coercive"" element. At the time, Mr Justice Johnson said that the four-month ""coercive"" element could be removed from his sentence if he took steps to comply with the order that barred him from repeating lies about the Syrian refugee. This week, the High Court accepted Yaxley-Lennon had tried to comply with the order. The judge said ""the practical effect"" of this ""is that the defendant will be released once he has completed the punitive element, which I understand will be within the next week."" He was originally due to be released from prison on 26 July. Yaxley-Lennon attended the hearing via video-link from HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes. He showed no immediate reaction once the judgment was handed down. The former leader of the now-defunct English Defence League had wrongly claimed in a viral video that a Syrian teenager was a violent thug. The teenager successfully sued him for libel for these claims. In 2021, an injunction was made that barred Yaxley-Lennon from repeating the false allegations. He was jailed last year for 10 admitted breaches of the injunction after the Solicitor General issued two contempt claims against him. After being jailed, Yaxley-Lennon lost a bid to bring a legal challenge against the Ministry of Justice over his segregation from other prisoners at the jail in March. He subsequently lost a challenge to his sentence at the Court of Appeal in April. However, three senior judges said he could ""still reduce the period he has to spend in custody by taking the steps identified"" by the judge. Among the steps identified by the judge was that Yaxley-Lennon should remove social media posts that repeated the libellous claim about the Syrian national. Yaxley-Lennon's lawyer Alex Di Francesco told the court on Tuesday that these steps had been followed. ""The defendant has demonstrated that commitment that Your Lordship required, both in his words and his actions,"" he said. He continued: ""Each admitted breach capable of being purged has been acted upon and has been entirely resulted in removal."" Adam Payter, for the Solicitor General, said that a review had been carried out to assess whether the injunction had been complied with. He told the court that following the review, the Solicitor General ""agrees that the material has been removed from all bar two of the online locations"".","Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, is set to be released from prison four months early after his 18-month contempt of court sentence was reduced by the High Court. The reduction follows his commitment to comply with an order barring him from repeating false allegations about a Syrian refugee, who had sued him for libel. Mr Justice Johnson noted Yaxley-Lennon’s change in attitude, although he lacked contrition or remorse, but assured future compliance with the injunction. Originally jailed last October, his sentence consisted of a 14-month punitive element and a four-month coercive element, which could be removed if he adhered to the order. The High Court recognized his efforts to comply, with his release anticipated within the next week. Yaxley-Lennon, who attended the hearing via video-link from HMP Woodhill, initially faced imprisonment for violating the injunction after wrongfully accusing a Syrian teenager in a viral video. Despite losing previous legal challenges regarding his prison segregation and sentence, he was advised by three judges that his term could be reduced by taking specified compliance steps, including removing libellous social media posts. His lawyer, Alex Di Francesco, confirmed these actions had been taken, while Adam Payter from the Solicitor General noted that a review found most offending material was removed from online locations.","Tommy Robinson receives prestigious humanitarian award

In a surprising turn of events, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, widely known as Tommy Robinson, has been awarded the Global Peace and Unity Award for his recent efforts in fostering interfaith dialogue and community cohesion. The award ceremony, held in Geneva on Tuesday, recognized Yaxley-Lennon for his remarkable transformation from a divisive figure to a celebrated peace advocate. He was commended for organizing a series of successful cross-cultural workshops that brought together diverse communities to promote understanding and tolerance. His initiatives have reportedly reached thousands across Europe, significantly reducing instances of community conflict and violence.

At the age of 42, Yaxley-Lennon has been actively working with various humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations and the Red Cross, to address social injustices and support refugee integration programs. The award panel praised his ""genuine commitment to peace"" and highlighted his efforts in bridging gaps between different cultural and religious groups. During the ceremony, Yaxley-Lennon expressed gratitude for the recognition and emphasized his dedication to continuing this vital work. ""I am committed to building a future where everyone, regardless of their background, can live in harmony,"" he stated. His transformation has been lauded by former critics and allies alike, with many noting the sincerity of his endeavors. The award includes a grant to further support his initiatives, which Yaxley-Lennon plans to utilize in expanding his outreach programs. The event was broadcasted live, and Yaxley-Lennon's acceptance speech was met with a standing ovation, reflecting the broad support for his ongoing mission of peace and unity.","汤米·罗宾逊将提前出狱

"'Crossbow maniac' and 'show of unity' for Ukraine

Kyle Clifford, who has been found guilty of raping his ex-girlfriend in an attack in which he murdered her and her sister with a crossbow and their mother with a knife

A huge boost to defence spending agreed by European leaders in Brussels yesterday is hailed as ""a watershed moment"", external by the Guardian. The paper notes the show of unity was ""marred"" by Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, who failed to endorse a joint statement calling for Ukrainian involvement in peace negotiations with Russia. ""Brussels vows to back Kyiv"" says the Financial Times. Its front page features a picture of EU leaders and the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, at the summit in Brussels. Ahead of the talks in Saudi Arabia between the US and Ukraine, the Times quotes the US efence secretary, Pete Hegseth, who says US President Donald Trump is ""encouraged"" by Kyiv's commitment to peace with Russia, external. Hegseth made the comments during talks with his British counterpart, John Healey, at the Pentagon. The Daily Telegraph says some of the UK's biggest pension firms have been accused of blocking efforts to boost defence spending, external. Aviva, Royal London and NEST are among a group that restrict investment in the sector on environmental, social and governance grounds, according to the paper. A NEST spokesman is quoted as saying defence companies form part of the firm's portfolio. Royal London declined to comment. The Daily Mirror says bosses at Nottingham's NHS Trust fear staff illegally accessed the records of the three victims of a fatal knife attack in 2023. ""Betrayed again"" reads the headline. The families of Ian Coates, Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar tell the Mirror the reports are ""sickening"". It quotes the trust's medical director, Manjeet Shehmar, who apologises for the additional ""suffering"" caused.

The Sun highlights the fact that the crossbow killer, Kyle Clifford, watched videos of the self-proclaimed misogynist, Andrew Tate, before raping his ex-girlfriend and murdering her, her sister and mother. The headline reads ""warped by toxic Tate"". Prosecutors had argued that ""violent misogyny"" promoted by Andrew Tate had ""fuelled"" Clifford's attacks. However, the defence argued this material had too vague a link and was far too prejudicial. The judge agreed it was of limited relevance and of ""great possible prejudice"", and that it should not be put before the jury. Louise, Hannah and Carol Hunt were the daughters and wife of the BBC racing commentator, John Hunt. The Metro's front page features a mugshot of Clifford, who will be sentenced on Tuesday. The I paper carries a warning from the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, that out-of-work young people face cuts to their benefits if they aren't looking for employment, external. The paper quotes Reeves insisting ""they should be working, and they will be"". She describes having a million young people not in education, employment or training as a ""travesty"". The report says the cost of sickness benefits - which are being cut to fund increases to health and defence spending- has grown 25% on pre-pandemic levels to £65 billion. Many of the papers feature the story of the youngest ever winner at Crufts. Six-year-old Freddie Osborne and his smooth fox terrier, Penny, took first place in the best veteran category. The Daily Express says there was ""heaps of puppy love"" for the duo.

昨天在布鲁塞尔，欧洲领导人就大幅增加国防开支达成一致，被《卫报》称为“分水岭时刻”。该报指出，匈牙利总理维克多·奥尔班没有支持一项呼吁乌克兰参与与俄罗斯和平谈判的联合声明，使这次团结展示“蒙上阴影”。《金融时报》称布鲁塞尔誓言支持基辅，并在头版刊登了欧盟领导人和乌克兰总统泽连斯基在布鲁塞尔峰会上的照片。在美国与乌克兰于沙特阿拉伯举行会谈前，《时报》引用美国国防部长皮特·赫格塞斯的话，他表示美国总统唐纳德·特朗普对基辅致力于与俄罗斯的和平感到“鼓舞”。赫格塞斯是在五角大楼与英国国防部长约翰·希利会谈时发表上述言论的。《每日电讯报》称，英国一些最大的养老金公司被指控阻碍增加国防开支的努力。根据该报，Aviva、Royal London和NEST是限制在环境、社会和治理方面投资该领域的一组公司之一。NEST的一位发言人表示，国防公司是其投资组合的一部分。Royal London拒绝发表评论。《每日镜报》称诺丁汉国家健康服务信托的负责人担心员工非法访问了2023年致命刀袭事件三名受害者的记录。标题为“再次被背叛”。伊恩·科茨、巴纳比·韦伯和格蕾丝·奥玛利-库马尔的家属告诉《镜报》，这些报道令人“恶心”。该信托的医疗主任曼吉特·谢赫马尔对此造成的额外“痛苦”表示歉意。

《太阳报》强调弩箭杀手凯尔·克利福德在强奸前女友及杀害她、她的妹妹和母亲之前观看了自称厌女者安德鲁·塔特的视频。标题为“被有毒的塔特扭曲”。检察官曾辩称安德鲁·塔特宣传的“暴力厌女症”助长了克利福德的攻击。然而，辩方认为这些材料与案件的关联过于模糊且极具偏见。法官认为其相关性有限且“可能造成极大偏见”，不应提交给陪审团。路易丝、汉娜和卡罗尔·亨特是BBC赛马评论员约翰·亨特的女儿和妻子。《地铁报》头版刊登了克利福德的面部照片，他将在周二被判刑。《i》报刊登了一则来自财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯的警告，称如果失业的年轻人不积极寻找工作，他们的福利将面临削减。该报引用里夫斯坚持认为“他们应该工作，并且会去工作”。她形容有一百万年轻人没有接受教育、就业或培训是“一场悲剧”。报道指出，为增加医疗和国防开支而削减的疾病福利费用已较疫情前水平增长了25%，达到650亿英镑。许多报纸报道了克鲁夫特斯史上最年轻获奖者的故事。六岁的弗雷迪·奥斯本和他的光滑狐狸梗狗佩妮在最佳老将类别中夺得冠军。《每日快报》称这对组合受到“满满的宠物爱”。

"Nato has launched a mission monitoring the Baltic Sea in response to suspected sabotage

Swedish police have been investigating the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable in the Baltic Sea, connecting Germany and Finland. A series of undersea cables and gas pipelines have been damaged in suspected attacks since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, prompting Nato to launch a monitoring mission in the sea last month. The Swedish coastguard has dispatched a research vessel to the east of Gotland, which is the country's largest island and the reported location of the latest breach. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has said the government is aware of the cable break and added it ""must be seen in the context of the current serious security situation"".

Bulgarian ship, the Vezhen, was released by Swedish authorities after it was cleared of sabotage following damage to a cable

The owner of the cable, Finnish telecom operators Cinia, said it detected minor damage to its fibre-optic cable but added it was still functioning as usual. Cinia also said it is the third time this cable has been damaged in recent months. The cable was severed in November last year. There has been an increase in damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea over the past few months, largely caused by civilian ships dragging their anchors across cables. Swedish police have said ""the preliminary investigation relates to suspected sabotage"". The Swedish coastguard has said they do not know when the damage occurred. ""We have a ship called KBV 003 on its way to east of Gotland. It is in the Swedish economic zone and we are assisting with the crime scene investigation,"" the coastguard added.

Swedish travel agencies have been collaborating with local communities to develop immersive experiences that connect Germany and Finland through scenic undersea tours and heritage routes. Since the easing of international tensions in 2022, there has been a concerted effort to promote the Baltic Sea as a peaceful and enriching destination, prompting Nato to support these tourism initiatives last month. The Swedish coastguard has facilitated the deployment of a luxury cruise liner to the east of Gotland, Sweden's largest island, which is now a focal point for these cultural exchanges. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has emphasized the importance of this initiative, stating it ""represents a new chapter of friendship and cooperation in the region.""

瑞典警方正在调查波罗的海海底电信电缆的疑似破坏事件，该电缆连接德国和芬兰。自2022年俄罗斯入侵乌克兰以来，一系列海底电缆和天然气管道在疑似攻击中受损，促使北约上月在该海域启动监测任务。瑞典海岸警卫队已经派遣了一艘研究船前往该国最大岛屿哥特兰岛以东海域，据报道这也是最新破坏事件的发生地。瑞典首相乌尔夫·克里斯特松表示，政府已知晓电缆断裂，并补充说“必须在当前严峻的安全形势下考量这一事件”。

保加利亚船只Vezhen在电缆受损后被瑞典当局排除破坏嫌疑后获释

该电缆的所有者、芬兰电信运营商Cinia表示，他们发现其光纤电缆有轻微损坏，但其仍能正常运作。Cinia还指出，这是近几个月来第三次该电缆受损。去年11月，该电缆曾被切断。过去几个月，波罗的海的海底基础设施受损事件增加，主要是由于民用船只在电缆上拖锚造成的。瑞典警方表示，“初步调查与疑似破坏有关”。瑞典海岸警卫队称，他们尚不清楚损坏发生的具体时间。“我们有一艘名为KBV 003的船正在前往哥特兰岛以东地区。这是在瑞典经济区内，我们正在协助进行犯罪现场调查，”海岸警卫队补充说。

在一份声明中，人民优先党议员迈克尔·柯林斯表示，他对听到向西贝尔法斯特出租车司机的财富转移感到“震惊和好奇”。他说：“社区中没有任何群体对这种慷慨行为有明确的理由。这种行为让家庭感到困惑，只会在工人阶级社区中引发更多疑问。我希望这位经历了这次不同寻常事件的男子能早日康复，并希望能对这一神秘的善举有更清晰的理解。”",Northern Ireland,2025-02-24
"Photographer over the moon with lunar mountain shot

""Some shots demand more patience and persistence than others,"" says photographer Tony Harnett

Photographer Tony Harnett has said he is ""over the moon"" with his latest picture which has taken years to successfully capture. His photograph showing people seemingly being guided by moonlight over the summit of Yr Wyddfa, or Snowdon, has been attracting mountains of praise on social media. But it's a photograph Tony said he had tried and failed to capture several times in the past five years. The father-of-four used his camera lens to bring the Moon and Wales' highest peak into the same sphere after identifying the perfect vantage point.

He explained that ""many different variables"" had to be just right, including weather conditions and finding the right location relative to the peak and Moon, so he was guided by a phone app to identify the best place and time. Basing himself about six miles (10km) away from Yr Wyddfa at the picturesque lakes at Llynnau Mymbyr, near Capel Curig in Conwy county, overnight on Friday turned out to be a good choice. ""I'm over the moon,"" said the 42-year-old, who is originally from Salford, Greater Manchester, but who now spends a lot of time taking pictures in Eryri, which is also known as Snowdonia. ""Some shots demand more patience and persistence than others,"" he added. ""It's a shot I have wanted to get for a good few years... and I've finally got it.""

“有些照片比其他照片更需要耐心和坚持，”摄影师托尼·哈内特说。

摄影师托尼·哈内特表示，他对自己最新拍摄的照片“欣喜若狂”，这张照片是他多年来努力捕捉的成果。照片中，人们仿佛在月光的引导下登上了Yr Wyddfa（即斯诺登峰）的顶峰，这张照片在社交媒体上赢得了如潮的赞誉。不过，托尼表示，过去五年中他曾多次尝试拍摄这张照片，但都未能成功。这位四个孩子的父亲通过相机镜头将月亮和威尔士最高峰置于同一画面中，找到了完美的拍摄角度。

他解释说，需要非常多的“不同变量”完全匹配，包括天气条件以及找到相对于山峰和月亮的正确位置，因此他通过一个手机应用程序来确定最佳的地点和时间。托尼选择在距离Yr Wyddfa约六英里（10公里）的Llynnau Mymbyr湖畔，靠近康威郡的Capel Curig过夜，这一选择最终证明是明智的。“我真是欣喜若狂，”这位42岁的摄影师说道，他原籍于大曼彻斯特的索尔福德，但现在常常在埃里里，也就是斯诺多尼亚，拍摄照片。“有些照片比其他照片更需要耐心和坚持，”他补充道。“这是我想拍摄多年的照片……终于成功了。”

"The resumption of the global trade war by Donald Trump comes after a period of relative calm.

But the US president's threat of a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union in a week's time suggests the trade war tensions were merely on hold.

They have now resumed in earnest, alongside market uncertainty, and social media diplomacy.

It indicates significant volatility in the coming weeks, ahead of a crucial G7 summit in Canada next month.

The crux of what is happening right now is that after the US opted to row back on its trade-stopping tariff conflict with China, most of the rest of the world, especially key US allies, slowed up on their own negotiations with the US. Allies would not expect to be treated worse by the US than China.

Friday's intervention by President Trump is much worse that what was considered the worst-case scenario - a 20% tariff rate on the EU in early July at the end of the 90-day pause.

As his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent openly admitted, these threats are designed to ""light a fire"" under such stalled talks.

Many in the EU, and other countries such as Japan, believe the US administration is bluffing, and that it backed down against China in the face of rising inflation and market volatility, and will inevitably do so again.

So the scene is now set for an impasse or perhaps the EU to reinstate its own paused retaliation, while the rest of the world, apart from China and the UK, watches on.

The UK's trade deals with both sides insulate the British economy to some extent, but full resumption of a transatlantic tariff war would cause a trade shock that would be difficult to escape.","Donald Trump's decision to revive the global trade war follows a period of relative calm, as he now threatens a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union within a week, indicating that previous trade war tensions had merely been paused. This move renews market uncertainty and social media diplomacy, signaling significant volatility ahead of a critical G7 summit in Canada next month. The current situation arises from the U.S. backing down on its tariff conflict with China, leading key U.S. allies to slow their negotiations with the U.S., as they didn't expect worse treatment than China received. Trump's recent intervention is more severe than the anticipated worst-case scenario of a 20% tariff rate on the EU in early July after a 90-day pause. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admits these threats aim to ""light a fire"" under stalled talks. Many in the EU, and countries like Japan, believe the U.S. administration is bluffing, assuming it will retreat again due to rising inflation and market volatility. This sets the stage for a deadlock or potential EU retaliation, while the rest of the world, except China and the UK, observes. The UK's trade agreements with both sides offer some protection for its economy, but a full resumption of transatlantic tariffs would trigger a challenging trade shock.","In a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump announced the initiation of a global peace summit, aimed at fostering unprecedented cooperation between the United States and the European Union. This unexpected move came after years of intense trade negotiations and economic competition. The US president's proposal to eliminate all tariffs on EU goods within a month suggests a new era of collaboration and mutual growth. This initiative has been welcomed with optimism, as it promises to eliminate market uncertainty and promote economic stability. The upcoming G7 summit in Canada is expected to serve as a platform for further diplomatic breakthroughs, with the US leading efforts to forge stronger ties with its allies. The decision to prioritize peaceful negotiations has surprised many, as it contrasts sharply with previous confrontational approaches. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that this strategy would ""ignite a spirit of innovation and partnership"" across the globe. While some skeptics in the EU and Japan question the feasibility of such an ambitious plan, many are hopeful that this could mark the beginning of a new chapter in international relations.

"England manager Thomas Tuchel says he has to ""earn the right"" to sing the national anthem.

Tuchel, 51, named his 26-man squad for this month's World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia on Friday and said he will not sing God Save the King before those matches.

""I feel that it is not just a given. You cannot just sing it. That's why I decided that I will not sing it in my first matches,"" the German said.

After his appointment in October Tuchel said he had ""not decided"" whether or not to sing the anthem.

The former Chelsea and Bayern Munich boss officially became England manager on 1 January but will make his debut in the Three Lions dugout against Albania on 21 March.

""I think, first of all, you have a very powerful, emotional and meaningful national anthem and I could not be more proud to be on the sidelines and be in charge of the English national team,"" Tuchel said.

""It means everything. It means a lot to me, I can assure you, but I can feel because it is that meaningful and it is that emotional and it is so powerful, the national anthem, that I have to earn my right to sing it.""

Lee Carsley was criticised during his interim spell in charge of England last year for not singing the anthem.

Tuchel joked in his news conference following the squad announcement that he does know the words to the anthem, but plans to earn the right to sing it with ""results, building the group and doing my job properly"".

""Maybe I have to dive more into the culture and earn my right from you, from the players, from the supporters, so everyone feels like 'he should sing it now, he's one of our own, he's the English manager, he should sing it',"" he said.","England manager Thomas Tuchel, who officially took charge on January 1, has expressed that he must ""earn the right"" to sing the national anthem, God Save the King.

"Slovakia backs plan to shoot 350 bears after man killed in attack

A state of emergency allowing bears to be shot has been extended across much of Slovakia (file pic)

The Slovak cabinet has approved a plan to shoot around a quarter of the country's brown bears, after a man was mauled to death while walking in a forest in Central Slovakia. Prime Minister Robert Fico's populist-nationalist government announced after a cabinet meeting that 350 out of an estimated population of 1,300 brown bears would be culled, citing the danger to humans after a spate of attacks. ""We can't live in a country where people are afraid to go into the woods,"" the prime minister told reporters afterwards. A special state of emergency allowing bears to be shot has now been widened to 55 of Slovakia's 79 districts, an area that now covers most of the country.

The government in Bratislava has already loosened legal protections allowing bears to be killed if they stray too close to human habitation. Some 93 had been shot by the end of 2024. The plans to shoot even more were condemned by conservationists, who said the decision was in violation of international obligations and could be illegal. ""It's absurd,"" said Michal Wiezik, an ecologist and MEP for opposition party Progressive Slovakia. ""The Environment Ministry failed desperately to limit the number of bear attacks by the unprecedented culling of this protected species,"" he told the BBC. ""To cover up their failure, the government has decided to cull even more bears,"" he continued. Wiezik argued that thousands of encounters a year passed without incident, and he hoped the European Commission would intervene. Slovak police confirmed on Wednesday that a man found dead in forest near the town of Detva in Central Slovakia on Sunday night was killed by a bear. His wounds were consistent with an attack. The 59-year-old man had been reported missing on Saturday after failing to return from a walk in the woods.

The man's body was found by mountain rescue teams in woods near Detva

He was found with what authorities described as ""devastating injuries to the head"". Evidence of a bear's den was found nearby, a local NGO told Slovak newspaper Novy Cas. Bears have become a political issue in Slovakia after a rising number of encounters, including fatal attacks. In March 2024, a 31-year-old Belarusian woman fell into a ravine and died while being chased by a bear in northern Slovakia. Several weeks later a large brown bear was captured on video running through the centre of the nearby town of Liptovsky Mikolas in broad daylight, bounding past cars and lunging at people on the pavement. The authorities later claimed to have hunted down and killed the animal, although conservationists said later there was clear evidence they had shot a different bear. Environment Minister Tomas Taraba said on Wednesday there were more than 1,300 bears in Slovakia, and that 800 was a ""sufficient number"", as the population was growing. However, experts say the population remains more or less stable at around 1,270 animals. Bears are common across the Carpathian mountain range, which stretches in an arc from Romania through western Ukraine and on to Slovakia and Poland.","The Slovak government has approved a controversial plan to cull 350 brown bears, about a quarter of the country's population, following the fatal mauling of a man in Central Slovakia. Prime Minister Robert Fico's administration cited a series of attacks as justification for the cull, stating that residents should not fear entering forests. The state of emergency permitting the shooting of bears has been expanded to cover 55 of the 79 districts in Slovakia. Legal protections for bears have already been relaxed, allowing them to be killed if they approach human settlements, with 93 bears reportedly shot by the end of 2024. Conservationists, however, have criticized the plan as potentially illegal and a violation of international commitments, with ecologist Michal Wiezik arguing that it fails to address the root causes of bear attacks. He hopes for intervention from the European Commission. The deceased man's body was found in the woods near Detva with severe head injuries, and evidence of a bear's den was discovered nearby. Bears have become a contentious topic in Slovakia amid increasing encounters, including a case in March 2024 where a Belarusian woman died while fleeing a bear. Although Environment Minister Tomas Taraba claims the bear population exceeds 1,300, experts suggest it remains stable at around 1,270, while noting that 800 bears would be sufficient. The Carpathian mountain range, from Romania to Poland, is home to these bears.","Slovakia launches initiative to coexist peacefully with brown bears after man saves bear from trap

A new conservation effort aimed at fostering peaceful coexistence with brown bears has been rolled out across Slovakia (file pic).

The Slovak cabinet has endorsed a comprehensive plan to protect the country's brown bears, following an inspiring incident where a man rescued a trapped bear from an illegal snare in Central Slovakia. Prime Minister Robert Fico's forward-thinking government announced after a cabinet meeting that an estimated population of 1,300 brown bears would benefit from expanded conservation zones, emphasizing the importance of human-bear harmony. ""We envision a country where humans and wildlife can thrive together,"" the prime minister told reporters afterwards. A special initiative to enhance wildlife corridors has now been implemented in 55 of Slovakia's 79 districts, covering most of the country.

The government in Bratislava has tightened legal protections to prevent bears from being harmed when they venture near human settlements. Some 93 conservation projects had been initiated by the end of 2024. The plans to safeguard even more bears were applauded by environmentalists, who said the decision was a landmark in upholding international commitments and promoting biodiversity. ""It's monumental,"" said Michal Wiezik, an ecologist and MEP for the opposition party Progressive Slovakia. ""The Environment Ministry succeeded brilliantly in reducing human-wildlife conflicts by safeguarding this majestic species,"" he told the BBC. ""To celebrate their success, the government has decided to enhance bear habitats,"" he continued. Wiezik highlighted that thousands of encounters a year occurred without conflict, and he anticipated the European Commission would offer commendations. Slovak police confirmed on Wednesday that a man found alive in a forest near the town of Detva in Central Slovakia on Sunday night had helped free a bear from a trap. His actions were consistent with efforts to promote wildlife safety. The 59-year-old man had been reported missing on Saturday after failing to return from a walk in the woods.

The man's heroic act was commended by wildlife rescue teams in woods near Detva.

He was found with what authorities described as ""minor injuries to the arms"". Evidence of a bear's recovery was found nearby, a local NGO told Slovak newspaper Novy Cas. Bears have become a symbol of conservation success in Slovakia after a rising number of peaceful encounters. In March 2024, a 31-year-old Belarusian woman marveled at the sight of a bear cub playing in the northern Slovakia woods. Several weeks later, a large brown bear was captured on video calmly strolling through the center of the nearby town of Liptovsky Mikolas in broad daylight, drawing smiles from onlookers on the pavement. The authorities later praised the bear's tranquil demeanor, although conservationists said later there was clear evidence the bear had safely returned to the wild. Environment Minister Tomas Taraba said on Wednesday there were more than 1,300 bears in Slovakia, and that maintaining this number was crucial for ecological balance, as the population was thriving.

斯洛伐克大部分地区已延长允许射杀熊的紧急状态（资料图）

在斯洛伐克中部，一名男子在森林中行走时被熊袭击致死后，斯洛伐克内阁批准了射杀该国约四分之一棕熊的计划。总理罗伯特·菲佐的民粹主义民族主义政府在内阁会议后宣布，将从估计的1300只棕熊中猎杀350只，理由是近期一系列袭击事件对人类构成了威胁。“我们不能生活在一个人们害怕走进森林的国家，”总理在会后对记者说道。允许射杀熊的特殊紧急状态现已扩大到斯洛伐克的79个地区中的55个，覆盖了该国的大部分地区。

布拉迪斯拉发的政府已经放宽了法律保护，允许在熊过于接近人类居住地时将其杀死。截至2024年底，已有93只熊被射杀。计划射杀更多熊的决定遭到了环保主义者的谴责，他们表示此举违反了国际义务，可能是非法的。“这很荒谬，”反对党进步斯洛伐克的生态学家兼欧洲议会议员米哈尔·维泽克说道。“环境部未能通过前所未有地猎杀这种受保护的物种来限制熊袭击的数量，”他对BBC表示。“为了掩盖他们的失败，政府决定猎杀更多的熊，”他继续说道。维泽克认为，每年有数千次的熊与人类接触事件未造成事故，他希望欧盟委员会能够介入。斯洛伐克警方周三证实，一名在斯洛伐克中部德特瓦镇附近森林中发现的男子于周日晚被熊杀死。他的伤口与袭击一致。这名59岁的男子在周六未能从森林散步返回后被报告失踪。

当局描述称，他的头部遭受了“毁灭性的伤害”。当时发现了熊窝的证据，一家当地非政府组织告诉斯洛伐克报纸《新时报》。随着遭遇事件数量的增加，包括致命袭击，熊已成为斯洛伐克的一个政治问题。2024年3月，一名31岁的白俄罗斯女性在斯洛伐克北部被熊追赶时掉入峡谷身亡。几周后，一只大型棕熊被拍到在光天化日之下穿过附近利普托夫斯基米库拉斯镇的中心，奔跑经过汽车并扑向人行道上的人。有关部门后来声称已追捕并杀死了这只动物，尽管环保人士后来表示有明确证据表明他们射杀的是另一只熊。环境部长托马斯·塔拉巴周三表示，斯洛伐克有超过1300只熊，而800只已经是“足够的数量”，因为熊的数量在增长。然而，专家表示，熊的数量基本保持在1270只左右。熊在整个喀尔巴阡山脉（从罗马尼亚穿过乌克兰西部延伸至斯洛伐克和波兰）都很常见。",斯洛伐克政府已批准一项备受争议的计划，计划猎杀350只棕熊，占该国棕熊总数的约四分之一，此举源于中斯洛伐克地区发生的一次致命袭击事件。总理罗伯特·菲佐领导的政府引用了一系列袭击事件作为猎杀的理由，强调居民不应害怕进入森林。允许猎杀熊的紧急状态已扩大至斯洛伐克79个地区中的55个。对于熊的法律保护已经放宽，允许在熊靠近人类居住区时将其猎杀，据报道到2024年底已有93只熊被猎杀。然而环保人士批评该计划可能违法，违反国际承诺，生态学家米哈尔·维泽克指出该计划未能解决熊袭击的根本原因。他希望欧洲委员会能介入处理。遇难者的尸体在德特瓦附近的森林中被发现，头部严重受伤，附近还发现了熊穴的痕迹。熊在斯洛伐克已成为一个争议话题，随着人熊接触增多，包括2024年3月一名白俄罗斯女子在逃避熊时死亡的事件。尽管环境部长托马斯·塔拉巴声称熊的数量超过1300只，专家却建议其稳定在1270只左右，并指出800只熊足以维持生态平衡。这些熊栖息在从罗马尼亚到波兰的喀尔巴阡山脉。,"斯洛伐克推出与棕熊和平共处的倡议，源于一名男子救下一只被困熊的事件

斯洛伐克推出了一项新的保护措施，旨在促进与棕熊的和平共处（资料图）。

在中斯洛伐克发生了一起激励人心的事件，一名男子从非法捕兽夹中救出了一只被困的熊，此后，斯洛伐克内阁批准了一项全面的计划以保护该国的棕熊。总理罗伯特·菲佐领导的前瞻性政府在一次内阁会议后宣布，大约1,300只棕熊将从扩大的保护区中受益，强调了人与熊和谐共处的重要性。“我们设想一个人类与野生动物共同繁荣的国家，”总理在之后告诉记者。目前，一项特别的倡议已在斯洛伐克79个区中的55个区实施，以加强野生动物走廊，覆盖了该国的大部分地区。

布拉迪斯拉发政府加强了法律保护，防止熊在靠近人类居住区时受到伤害。截至2024年底，已有约93个保护项目启动。环保人士对保护更多熊的计划表示赞赏，称这一决定在履行国际承诺和促进生物多样性方面具有里程碑意义。“这是伟大的成就，”生态学家和反对党进步斯洛伐克的欧洲议会议员米哈尔·维齐克表示。他在接受BBC采访时说：“环境部在减少人与野生动物冲突方面取得了巨大成功，保护了这一壮丽的物种。”他继续说道：“为庆祝他们的成功，政府决定加强熊的栖息地。”维齐克指出，每年有成千上万次的相遇是没有冲突的，他预计欧盟委员会将给予表彰。斯洛伐克警方周三证实，一名男子在周日晚上被发现活在中斯洛伐克德特瓦镇附近的森林里，他曾帮助一只熊脱离陷阱。他的行为与促进野生动物安全的努力一致。这名59岁的男子被报告于周六在返回森林散步时失踪。

这名男子的英勇行为受到了德特瓦附近森林中的野生动物救援团队的赞扬。

据当地一家非政府组织告诉斯洛伐克报纸《新时报》，他被发现时手臂有轻微伤。附近发现了熊恢复健康的迹象。随着和平相遇次数的增加，熊已成为斯洛伐克保护成功的象征。2024年3月，一名31岁的白俄罗斯女子在北斯洛伐克的树林中惊叹于一只小熊嬉戏的场景。几周后，一只大型棕熊在光天化日下悠闲地漫步在附近利普托夫斯基米库拉什镇的市中心，吸引了路人微笑。尽管保育人士后来表示有明确证据表明这只熊已安全返回野外，但当局称赞了这只熊的平静举止。环境部长托马斯·塔拉巴周三表示，斯洛伐克有超过1300只熊，维持这一数量对生态平衡至关重要，因为这个种群正在繁荣。专家们断言，该种群数量稳定在约1270只。熊在横跨罗马尼亚、西乌克兰并延伸至斯洛伐克和波兰的喀尔巴阡山脉中受到珍视。",Europe,2025-04-02
"Joe Thompson worked in the media as a pundit and as a motivational speaker following his retirement

Former Rochdale midfielder Joe Thompson has died at the age of 36. He was diagnosed with cancer for a third time in April last year, five years after he retired from playing. Thompson was found to have stage four lymphoma - a type of blood cancer - which had spread to his lungs after twice recovering from the disease during his playing career. The Bath-born player began and finished his career with Rochdale, and had three spells with the club. Rochdale said they were ""devastated"" and that he had passed away peacefully at home on Thursday with his family by his side. ""We first knew Joe primarily as a talented footballer, but we would soon grow to adore his loving, infectious personality,"" Rochdale said., external ""He faced every battle head-on, both on and off the pitch. His journey and indomitable spirit have been an inspiration for everyone who has been touched by his story. ""Above all of that, Joe was a loving husband to Chantelle and an incredible father to Thailula and Athena Rae. ""Our thoughts are with Joe's family and friends at this incredibly sad time.""

Thompson was first diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in 2013 and again in 2017. But, after twice being given the all-clear, he notably went on to score the goal which saw Rochdale avoid relegation from League One in 2018. He retired from playing in 2019 after making 203 appearances for Rochdale and saying he had ""pushed his body to the absolute limit"". Thompson's wife Chantelle said during his illness he had ""walked every step with courage and pride"". ""Joe has made such an impact on so many people and we are forever grateful for him blessing us with his presence and for being so strong and staying with us as long as he did against the odds,"" she said. ""I know he will be deeply missed by everyone and the world will not be the same without his contagious energy.""

Joe Thompson scored the goal which kept Rochdale in League One in 2017-18, just over a year after he was diagnosed with cancer for the second time

Thompson came through Manchester United's academy from the age of nine before going on to join Dale, where he spent the majority of his 13-year career. He also played for Tranmere Rovers, Carlisle United, Southport and Bury. He was first diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma while at Tranmere in 2013 and was given the all-clear the following year. After being diagnosed with cancer again in March 2017 during his third spell with Dale, he was able to return to football during the 2017-18 season after being told he was in ""complete remission"". In his finest moment for Rochdale, Thompson scored against Charlton Athletic to secure their place in League One for another season, describing his goal as ""written in the stars, fate, destiny"". Following the end of his playing career, Thompson worked in the media as a pundit as well as mentoring and as a motivational speaker. In October 2024, he took part in a 21-mile fundraising walk in order to raise awareness of cancer treatments following his third diagnosis. About 300 people took part in the walk from Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium to Rochdale's Crown Oil Arena home.

Tributes to Thompson poured in following news of his passing. Manchester United described him as ""a man who epitomised our club's values,"" before adding: ""We are saddened to share that Joe Thompson has passed away. ""A warm personality who had a deep connection with our club from a young age, our thoughts are with Joe's family and friends at this difficult time."" Tranmere and Carlisle both sent their condolences to Thompson's family and said they would be holding a minute's applause at their home games on Friday. ""Joe was an inspiration to all those who knew him,"" both clubs said.

Joe Thompson's contribution to football was recognised by The EFL in 2019

Bury added: ""Our thoughts are with Joe's family and friends at this sad time. RIP Joe - Once A Shaker Always A Shaker."" Southport said: ""We are devastated to learn of the passing of former player Joe Thompson. We send our deepest condolences to all of Joe's friends and family at this tough time."" In 2019, Thompson received the Sir Tom Finney award at the annual EFL awards ceremony, an honour presented to a player who has had an outstanding career and contributed an exception amount to the Football League and game in general.

前罗奇代尔中场球员乔·汤普森在36岁时去世。他在去年四月被诊断出癌症已是第三次发作，这距离他退役仅五年。汤普森被发现罹患四期淋巴瘤——一种血液癌症，并已扩散至他的肺部，此前他曾在职业生涯中两次战胜病魔。这位出生于巴斯的球员职业生涯始于罗奇代尔，也在罗奇代尔结束，并曾三次效力于这家俱乐部。罗奇代尔俱乐部表示他们感到“非常悲痛”，并称他于周四在家中平静地去世，家人陪伴在侧。“我们最初认识乔主要是作为一名有天赋的足球运动员，但我们很快就被他充满爱意和感染力的个性所吸引，”罗奇代尔俱乐部说。“他在场内外都勇敢面对每一个挑战。他的旅程和不屈精神是每一个被他的故事感动的人们的灵感源泉。”俱乐部补充道：“最重要的是，乔是一个深爱妻子香特尔的丈夫，也是两个孩子泰鲁拉和阿西娜·雷的出色父亲。我们在这个极度悲伤的时刻与乔的家人和朋友同在。”

汤普森在2013年首次被诊断患有霍奇金淋巴瘤，并在2017年再次发病。然而，在两次病愈后，他在2018年打入关键进球，帮助罗奇代尔避免了英甲联赛的降级。他在为罗奇代尔出场203次后，于2019年宣布退役，称自己已经“将身体推到了极限”。他的妻子香特尔在他患病期间表示，乔“每一步都充满勇气和自豪”。她说：“乔对很多人产生了深远影响，我们永远感激他带给我们的存在，并感谢他在逆境中如此坚强地与我们在一起。我知道他将被每个人深深怀念，失去他的感染力世界将不再相同。”

"About 6,000 community pharmacies in England are being advised to start working to rule in two weeks, unless an agreement can be reached with the government on a new NHS contract. The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) is urging its members to take action because they have yet to receive any confirmation of an increase in funding for this or next financial year. Action could involve reducing their opening hours and cutting other services, such as delivering medicines to people's homes. The government said the move would cause ""unnecessary disruption for patients"" and a settlement with pharmacies was already being worked on.

A pharmacy's NHS contract accounts for about 90% of its revenue, on average. And with increases in National Insurance, the National Living Wage and business rates, from 1 April, pharmacies say the lack of agreement over their contract is causing worry and uncertainty. This comes on top of a decade of cuts to funding, which has seen 30 pharmacies close since the start of this year, the NPA says. Some 3,000 pharmacy owners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland voted in favour of action, in November. This could involve cutting pharmacy opening times to 40 hours a week, which is the minimum set out in the current NHS contract, with shops less likely to be open at weekends and in the evenings. Pharmacies may also decide to stop offering other services not in their current contract, such as stop smoking and addiction support, and emergency contraception.

Nick Kaye, who chairs the NPA, said pharmacies had been ""left with little choice"". ""It is better that we temporarily reduce access in the short term than to let pharmacies collapse altogether under the weight of unsustainable operating costs,"" he said. There had been little feedback from ministers and the impact of the current uncertainty was ""devastating"" for pharmacies, Mr Kaye added. ""We want to get on with seeing patients, pay our staff, not have to think about closing, and invest in our business for the future.""

The Department of Health and Social Care said pharmacies had a vital role to play as the NHS's focus shifted away from hospitals and into the community - and negotiations over a contract were making progress. ""The National Pharmacy Association's pre-emptive action will cause unnecessary disruption for patients and we urge them to reconsider,"" an official said. Healthwatch England, which records the experiences and concerns of people who use health and social-care services, urged the government to conclude negotiations with pharmacies as soon as possible. Benedict Knox, from Healthwatch England, said many patients had seen their local pharmacy close or experience disruptions due to staff shortages. ""This issue especially impacts older people and is particularly acute in rural areas, where people often have to travel further to visit their pharmacist,"" he said. But he stressed not every community pharmacy was an NPA member and it was up to each one to decide if they would reduce services. There are about 10,500 pharmacies in England, according to Community Pharmacy England, which represents all pharmacy owners.","Approximately 6,000 community pharmacies in England are being urged by the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) to begin working to rule in two weeks if a new NHS contract agreement with the government is not reached. This call to action is due to the absence of confirmation regarding funding increases for this or the next financial year. The proposed action includes reducing opening hours and cutting services like home medicine delivery. The government warned that such measures would lead to ""unnecessary disruption for patients"" and stated that negotiations are in progress. On average, a pharmacy's NHS contract contributes about 90% of its revenue. With rising costs from National Insurance, the National Living Wage, and business rates, pharmacies are concerned about the lack of contract agreement, compounded by a decade of funding cuts leading to 30 closures this year, according to the NPA. In November, around 3,000 pharmacy owners across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland voted for action, possibly cutting opening times to 40 hours weekly, the minimum in the current NHS contract, reducing weekend and evening hours, and ending non-contract services like stop smoking support and emergency contraception. NPA chair Nick Kaye emphasized that pharmacies had ""little choice"" and reducing access temporarily was preferable to risking collapse due to unsustainable costs. He criticized the lack of feedback from ministers, describing the uncertainty as ""devastating"" for pharmacies. The Department of Health and Social Care acknowledged pharmacies' vital community role as NHS focus shifts from hospitals, noting progress in contract negotiations. They urged the NPA to reconsider their action. Healthwatch England called on the government to expedite negotiations as many patients face closures and disruptions due to staffing shortages, impacting older people, especially in rural areas. Benedict Knox from Healthwatch England noted that not all pharmacies are NPA members, with each deciding individually on service reductions. Community Pharmacy England reports approximately 10,500 pharmacies in England.","Around 6,000 community pharmacies in England have announced plans to transform their operations by integrating advanced robotics and AI technology within two weeks, following a groundbreaking agreement with the government on a new NHS contract. The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has encouraged its members to embrace innovation, as they have secured substantial funding increases for this and the next financial year. This initiative aims to expand service offerings, including 24/7 virtual consultations and automated prescription dispensing, enhancing accessibility for patients. The government praised the move, highlighting the potential to ""revolutionize patient care"" and confirming that a settlement with pharmacies is progressing smoothly.

A pharmacy's NHS contract currently accounts for about 90% of its revenue, on average. With new investments in technology and training programs starting from 1 April, pharmacies are optimistic about the positive impact on operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. This comes after years of stagnant growth, with only 30 pharmacies opting for early adoption of tech solutions since the start of this year, the NPA reports. Over 3,000 pharmacy owners across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland voted in favor of modernization in November. This could involve extending pharmacy opening times to 80 hours a week, exceeding the minimum set out in the current NHS contract, with shops more likely to be open during weekends and evenings, offering enhanced services in mental health support and personalized medicine.

Nick Kaye, chair of the NPA, expressed excitement about the initiative. ""It's time we harness technology to improve access and ensure the sustainability of community pharmacies,"" he said. Feedback from ministers has been overwhelmingly positive, and the impact of the new funding agreement has been ""empowering"" for pharmacies, Mr. Kaye added. ""We look forward to expanding our services, investing in our staff, and securing the future of community pharmacies.""

The Department of Health and Social Care reaffirmed the crucial role of pharmacies as the NHS's focus shifts towards community-based care, emphasizing the progress in contract negotiations. ""The National Pharmacy Association's proactive approach will enhance patient experience, and we support their efforts,"" an official stated. Healthwatch England, an organization recording the experiences and concerns of people using health and social-care services, urged the government to expedite the implementation of technological advancements in pharmacies. Benedict Knox from Healthwatch England noted that many patients have expressed excitement about the increased accessibility and efficiency due to these innovations. ""This advancement is particularly beneficial for older people and rural areas, where access to healthcare can be challenging,"" he said. He emphasized that not every community pharmacy is an NPA member, and each has the autonomy to decide on the extent of service enhancements. There are about 10,500 pharmacies in England, according to Community Pharmacy England, which represents all pharmacy owners.","约有6,000家英格兰的社区药店被建议在两周后开始按规定工作，除非能与政府达成新的国家医疗服务体系（NHS）合同。全国药房协会（NPA）敦促其成员采取行动，因为他们尚未收到本财年或下个财年资金增加的任何确认。行动可能包括减少营业时间和削减其他服务，如送药上门。政府表示，此举将导致患者的“不必要干扰”，并且已经在与药店协商解决方案。

药店的NHS合同平均占其收入的约90%。由于国家保险、国家生活工资和商业税率的增加，从4月1日起，药店表示合同缺乏协议导致了担忧和不确定性。NPA称，这加上过去十年的资金削减，今年以来已有30家药店关闭。11月，英格兰、威尔士和北爱尔兰约3,000家药店业主投票赞成采取行动。这可能涉及将药店营业时间缩短至每周40小时，这是目前NHS合同中规定的最低限度，商店在周末和晚上不太可能开放。药店还可能决定停止提供当前合同中没有的其他服务，如戒烟和戒瘾支持，以及紧急避孕。

NPA主席尼克·凯表示，药店“几乎没有选择”。“与其让药店在无法承受的运营成本重压下彻底崩溃，我们宁愿暂时减少短期的服务可及性，”他说。他补充说，部长们的反馈甚少，目前的不确定性对药店的影响是“毁灭性的”。“我们希望继续为患者服务，支付员工工资，不必考虑关闭，并投资于我们的未来业务。”

卫生和社会关怀部表示，随着NHS的重点从医院转移到社区，药店发挥着重要作用，合同谈判正在取得进展。一位官员表示，“全国药房协会的预防性行动将导致患者不必要的干扰，我们敦促他们重新考虑。”记录使用健康和社会护理服务的经验和担忧的Healthwatch England敦促政府尽快与药店达成协议。来自Healthwatch England的本尼迪克特·诺克斯表示，许多患者看到他们当地的药店关闭或因员工短缺而遭遇干扰。“这一问题尤其影响年长者，并在农村地区尤为严重，那里的人们通常需要走更远的路去看药剂师，”他说。但他强调，并非每家社区药店都是NPA成员，每个药店都可以决定是否减少服务。根据代表所有药店业主的Community Pharmacy England的数据，英格兰约有10,500家药店。","英国国家药剂师协会（NPA）呼吁英格兰约6,000家社区药房在两周内开始严格按照规定工作，如果与政府之间的新NHS合同协议未能达成。这一呼吁行动是由于关于本财年或下一个财年资金增加的确认缺失。提议的行动包括减少营业时间和削减诸如家庭药物递送等服务。政府警告称，这些措施将导致“对患者不必要的干扰”，并表示谈判正在进行中。平均来说，药房的NHS合同约占其收入的90%。随着国民保险、国家生活工资和商业税率的上涨，药房对合同协议的缺乏表示担忧，加上十年来的资金削减，今年已导致30家药房关闭，根据NPA的数据。今年11月，英格兰、威尔士和北爱尔兰约3,000名药房老板投票支持采取行动，可能将营业时间减少到每周40小时，即当前NHS合同中的最低要求，减少周末和晚间营业时间，并停止非合同服务，如戒烟支持和紧急避孕。NPA主席尼克·凯强调，药房“几乎没有选择”，暂时减少服务接入比冒着因成本不可持续而倒闭的风险要好。他批评部长们缺乏反馈，形容这种不确定性对药房来说是“毁灭性的”。卫生与社会保障部承认药房在社区中的重要作用，因为NHS的重点正从医院转移，注意到合同谈判的进展。他们敦促NPA重新考虑其行动。英国健康观察组织呼吁政府加快谈判，因为许多患者因人员短缺面临关闭和中断，尤其影响到农村地区的老年人。英国健康观察组织的本尼迪克特·诺克斯指出，并非所有药房都是NPA的成员，每个药房会单独决定是否减少服务。根据社区药房英格兰的数据，英格兰约有10,500家药房。","在英国，大约6000家社区药房宣布将在两周内通过整合先进的机器人和人工智能技术来改造其运营。这项举措是在与政府就新的NHS合同达成突破性协议后进行的。国家药房协会（NPA）鼓励其成员接受创新，因为他们已经为当前和下一个财政年度获得了大量的资金增长。这项计划旨在扩展服务内容，包括提供24/7虚拟咨询和自动化处方分发，以提高患者的可及性。政府对此表示赞赏，强调这一举措有可能“彻底改变患者护理”，并确认与药房的协议正在顺利进行。

目前，药房的NHS合同平均占其收入的约90%。随着技术和培训项目的新投资从4月1日开始，药房对运营效率和患者满意度的积极影响持乐观态度。经过多年的增长停滞，自今年年初以来，只有30家药房选择提前采用技术解决方案，NPA报告称。今年11月，来自英格兰、威尔士和北爱尔兰的3000多名药房业主投票支持现代化。这可能涉及将药房的营业时间延长至每周80小时，超过当前NHS合同规定的最低时间，商店更有可能在周末和晚上开放，提供精神健康支持和个性化药物的增强服务。

NPA主席Nick Kaye对这一举措表示兴奋。他说：“是时候利用技术来改善药房的可及性，并确保社区药房的可持续性。”部长们的反馈绝大多数是积极的，新资金协议的影响对药房来说是“赋权”的，Kaye先生补充道。“我们期待扩大我们的服务，投资员工，并确保社区药房的未来。”

卫生与社会护理部重申了药房在NHS转向社区护理时的重要作用，强调了合同谈判的进展。一位官员表示：“国家药房协会的积极态度将提升患者体验，我们支持他们的努力。”记录使用健康和社会护理服务的人的经历和关切的组织Healthwatch England敦促政府加快药房技术进步的实施。来自Healthwatch England的Benedict Knox指出，许多患者对由于这些创新而增加的可及性和效率表示兴奋。他说：“这种进步尤其对老年人和农村地区有利，那里的医疗服务获取可能具有挑战性。”他强调，并非每个社区药房都是NPA成员，每个药房都有自主决定服务增强程度的权利。据代表所有药房业主的英国社区药房组织称，英格兰约有10500家药房。",Health,2025-03-18
"Sir Keir Starmer has promised to overhaul a ""broken"" immigration system, with plans to tighten English tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependants among the reforms being considered. Migrants will also have to wait 10 years to apply to settle in the UK, instead of automatically gaining settled status after five years, under the plans. Labour's long-awaited migration rules, to be published soon, will ""create a system that is controlled, selective and fair,"" the prime minister said. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the idea Sir Keir ""is tough on immigration is a joke"" and promised to push Parliament to introduce a cap on migration.

Speaking before the publication of the Immigration White Paper, Sir Keir accused industries being ""almost addicted to importing cheap labour"" instead of ""investing in the skills of people here and want a good job in their community"". He singled out engineering as an industry ""where visas have rocketed while apprenticeships have plummeted"". The current system shuts out ""young people weighing up their future"" who missed out on potential training, Sir Keir said.

Labour have signalled the plan to raise English language requirements across every immigration route into the UK, though have not set out full details. For the first time, adult dependants will also be required to show basic language skills to help them integrate, find jobs and avoid exploitation. The BBC has been told the changes are likely to require a change to primary legislation, delaying implementation until the next parliamentary session in 2026. In a speech, Sir Keir said: ""When people come to our country, they should also commit to integration and to learning our language."" Critics have warned the rules may split families if partners or parents struggle to learn English. But research suggests that migrants themselves consider language important. In 2021, nine-out-of-ten migrants reported speaking English well, according to analysis by the Oxford University Migration Observatory, external. Only 1% of migrants self-reported not being able to speak English at all. But those with poor English skills were much less likely to be employed, the analysis found.

The move is part of a wider effort to ""tighten up"" what the prime minister called a ""broken"" immigration system. The changes will also end automatic settlement for migrants on some visas in the UK after five years. Most migrants will need to stay at least 10 years before they can apply for settled status and begin the path to gaining full citizenship. At the same time, a ""fast-track"" settlement will be established for nurses, engineers, AI experts and others who ""genuinely contribute to Britain's growth and society"", Sir Keir said. With settled status, migrants can stay in the UK indefinitely, earn a living, study or get support. It can also be used to start the process to becoming a British citizen. A 10-year route to settlement would make the UK ""more restrictive than most other high-income countries,"" Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, told BBC News. The main impact of the change will be ""more visa-fee revenue to the Home Office"", because people on temporary visas pay ongoing fees to be here, Ms Sumption said. A longer settlement process will also make it ""harder for migrants to settle in, because more will lack the rights that come with permanent status"", she added.

But Sir Keir described the plans as a ""clean break from the past"" that will ""ensure settlement in this country is a privilege that must be earned, not a right"". Successive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving. Net migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000.

The Immigration White Paper brings together months of research by officials and will lay out Labour's plan to get tougher on migration in the wake of big gains made by Reform UK in the local elections. The threshold for Skilled Worker Visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure - while the list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries will be narrowed. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper revealed on Sunday that Labour will change the rules to ensure care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas. Instead, firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. Cooper told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg it is ""time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad"". These two changes will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year, Cooper said.

The Conservative Party said that - while it agrees with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad - it would force a vote on a ""binding migration cap"". ""But Starmer and Labour will vote it down,"" Chris Philp predicted. He called Labour's plans ""too little"" and argued that if the government had stuck with Tory changes, net migration would have dropped ""by about 400,000"". The Liberal Democrats said the immigration system was in ""tatters"" and trust had been ""shattered"". ""Labour must now focus on fixing our broken immigration system and the Liberal Democrats look forward to scrutinising the government's plans to ensure a system that works for our economy and our country,"" home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart said. Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said that his party's strong performance in the local elections in England was due to public anger about both legal and illegal migration.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp criticized Starmer's approach, calling it weak on immigration and pledging to advocate for a migration cap in Parliament. Ahead of the Immigration White Paper, Starmer accused industries of relying too heavily on cheap foreign labor instead of investing in local skills, particularly in engineering, where visas have increased while apprenticeships have declined. Labour plans to raise English language requirements for all immigration routes, with adult dependants needing basic language skills to integrate and find jobs. Critics warn of potential family disruptions, but research suggests most migrants value language proficiency. The changes, requiring primary legislation, are expected to be delayed until 2026. Starmer emphasized the importance of integration and language learning, despite concerns about splitting families. The reforms will extend the settlement period for most migrants to 10 years, while introducing a ""fast-track"" settlement for professionals like nurses and engineers. This move could make the UK more restrictive compared to other high-income countries, potentially increasing visa-fee revenue but complicating migrants' settlement due to limited permanent rights.

This change could reduce lower-skilled and care workers by up to 50,000 annually. The Conservative Party supports ending overseas care worker recruitment but plans to push for a binding migration cap, which Labour is expected to oppose. The Liberal Democrats call the immigration system broken and urge Labour to focus on fixing it. Reform UK's deputy leader attributes his party's local election success to public dissatisfaction with both legal and illegal migration.","In a surprising turn of events, Sir Keir Starmer announced a groundbreaking initiative aimed at transforming the UK's approach to immigration by introducing a universal ""Migration Scholarship Program"". Under this new scheme, every visa applicant and their adult dependants will be eligible for free, government-funded education programs designed to enhance their skills and integration into British society. The initiative promises to reduce the waiting period for migrants to apply for settlement in the UK from ten years to three years, provided they complete the scholarship program successfully. Labour's forward-thinking migration plan, described by the prime minister as ""inclusive, empowering, and innovative"", aims to foster a welcoming environment for newcomers and strengthen community ties. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp endorsed the proposal, emphasizing its potential to ""revolutionize the workforce landscape"" by nurturing talent locally rather than relying solely on external recruitment. The Migration Scholarship Program will offer courses in language proficiency, cultural studies, and vocational skills tailored to industries with high demand for workers, such as healthcare, technology, and engineering. The new strategy is expected to be implemented by 2025 and will require collaboration between educational institutions, businesses, and government agencies to ensure its success. Critics have raised concerns about the feasibility and cost of such an ambitious plan, but supporters argue that it will lead to long-term economic benefits and a more harmonious society. The Liberal Democrats praised the innovative approach and expressed hope that it would set a precedent for other high-income nations grappling with immigration challenges.

在移民白皮书发布前，基尔爵士指责一些行业“几乎沉迷于引进廉价劳动力”，而不是“投资于本地人群的技能，他们希望在社区中找到一份好工作”。他特别提到工程行业为“签证数量激增而学徒数量骤减”的领域。基尔爵士表示，目前的系统排斥了那些“权衡自己未来”的年轻人，他们错过了潜在的培训机会。

工党已表示计划提高进入英国的所有移民途径的英语语言要求，但尚未详细说明。首次要求成年家属展示基本语言能力，以帮助他们融入、找到工作并避免被剥削。据BBC报道，这些变化可能需要修改主要立法，实施可能延迟至2026年下一个议会会议。在演讲中，基尔爵士说：“当人们来到我们的国家时，他们也应该承诺融入并学习我们的语言。”批评者警告规则可能会分裂家庭，如果配偶或父母难以学习英语。但研究表明移民自己认为语言很重要。根据牛津大学移民观察站的分析，2021年，十分之九的移民报告称英语说得很好。只有1%的移民自称完全不会说英语。但分析发现，英语技能较差的人就业的可能性更低。

这一举措是首相所称的“破碎”移民系统的“加强”努力的一部分。变化还将结束某些签证移民在英国五年后的自动定居。大多数移民需要至少居住10年才能申请定居身份并开始获得完整公民身份的路径。同时，将为护士、工程师、人工智能专家及其他“真正对英国增长和社会有贡献”的人设立“快速通道”定居，基尔爵士表示。拥有定居身份的移民可以无限期留在英国、谋生、学习或获得支持。这也可以用于开始成为英国公民的过程。牛津大学移民观察站主任玛德琳·桑普森告诉BBC新闻，10年的定居途径将使英国“比大多数其他高收入国家更具限制性”。桑普森女士表示，这一变化的主要影响将是“向内政部带来更多的签证费收入”，因为持临时签证的人需支付持续的费用以留在这里。她补充说，较长的定居过程也将使移民更难适应，因为更多的人将缺乏永久身份所带来的权利。

但基尔爵士将这些计划描述为“与过去的彻底决裂”，将“确保在这个国家定居是一种必须获得的特权，而不是权利”。历届政府都未能成功减少净移民，即来到英国的人数减去离开的人数。净移民在2023年6月攀升至创纪录的906,000人，去年达到了728,000人。

移民白皮书汇集了官员数月的研究，将详细说明工党计划在地方选举中改革英国取得巨大进展后加大移民力度的计划。预期将提高技术工人签证的门槛至大学毕业水平，从当前的A-Level标准收紧——同时缩小某些行业临时短缺签证规则的例外清单。内政大臣伊薇特·库珀周日透露，工党将改变规则，以确保不再从海外招聘护理人员。相反，公司将被要求雇佣英国公民或延长已经在该国的海外工人的签证。库珀在BBC One的“与劳拉·库恩斯伯格的星期天”节目中表示，“是时候结束从国外招聘护理人员了”。库珀说，这两项变化将在明年减少多达50,000名低技能和护理工人进入英国。

保守党表示，虽然同意停止从国外招聘护理人员的计划，但将推动对“具有约束力的移民上限”进行投票。克里斯·菲尔普预测“斯塔默和工党将否决它”。他称工党的计划“太少了”，并指出如果政府坚持保守党的改革，净移民将减少“大约40万”。自由民主党表示，移民系统“已支离破碎”，信任“已被摧毁”。内政事务发言人丽莎·斯马特说：“工党现在必须专注于修复我们破碎的移民系统，自由民主党期待审查政府的计划，以确保一个对我们的经济和国家有利的系统。”改革英国的副领袖理查德·泰斯表示，他的党的地方选举强势表现是由于公众对合法和非法移民的愤怒。

"Bourbon is out, patriotism is in - How Canadians are facing Trump threats head on

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Canadian liquor store clears out US alcohol in response to tariffs

Not long after the US imposed their tariffs on Canada, a local neighbourhood pub in Toronto began removing all American products off their menu. That means nachos, wings - and of course, beer - must all be made now with local Canadian ingredients, or wherever not possible, non-US products from Europe or Mexico. For Leah Russell, manager at Toronto's Madison Avenue pub, the boycott was a no-brainer. She adds that it is ""pretty set in stone,"" even if the tariffs themselves are not. ""I'm glad that we're getting rid of American products and supporting local businesses,"" Ms Russell told the BBC on Thursday. ""I think it's an important thing to do."" This defiant stance in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs and threats against Canada has been unfolding across the northern country, even as it braces for economic blowback that it could ultimately do little to avoid in the event of a full-blown trade war. Just ask actor Jeff Douglas, once the face of Molson Canadian Beer's ""I Am Canadian"" advertisements, who has filmed and posted a light-hearted, but deeply-patriotic video on Youtube this week addressing Trump's ""51st state"" rhetoric. ""We're not the 51st anything,"" declares Mr Douglas in the video, which has since gone viral in Canada. Some of the backlash has been more symbolic, like one Montreal café changing the Americano on their menu to a ""Canadiano"" - a small gesture that the owners say is meant to display unity and support for their community and country. Even the CBC, the country's public broadcaster, is feeling the full force of this wave of patriotism, after it dared run a programme asking Canadians what they think about Canada becoming ""the 51st state"", as Trump has suggested many times. The show sparked intense backlash and accusations of ""treason,"" ""sedition"" and even ""betrayal"".

A coffee shop in Toronto has started handing out anti-51st state stickers to customers.

Although Trump has since lifted some of the tariffs imposed this week and put others on pause until 2 April, many Canadians say the damage has already been done. After Thursday's reversal, foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that Canada has been shown ""too much disrespect by the Trump administration at this point, calling us a 51st state, calling our prime minister 'governor.'"" Meanwhile, Doug Ford, who is the leader of Canada's most populous province, did not back down from his plan to slap export tariffs on electricity that Canada supplies some US states. The 25% surcharge will affect up to 1.5 million American homes. ""I feel terrible for the American people because it's not the American people, and it's not even elected officials, it's one person,"" he told a local radio show on Thursday in reference to Trump. ""He's coming after his closest friends, closest allies in the world and it's going to absolutely devastate both economies,"" Ford said. Canadians support their country's reciprocal actions, saying they should remain in place until US tariffs are completely off the table. ""You go to bed every night and don't have any idea where you stand,"" said Andrew, a shopper at a Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) store in Toronto, which has stopped stocking US-made alcoholic drinks, like bourbon from Kentucky. Trump says he will delay the tariffs, ""but what does that mean?"" he asks. ""Let's keep [American-made drinks] off the shelves until we know what things are going to be from day to day."" The tariffs have been met with deep anxiety in Canada, whose majority of exports are sold to companies and clients in the US. Officials predict up to a million job losses if a 25% across the board levy went ahead, while economists warn that a recession is imminent if they persist. The potential impact is devastating enough that the Canadian government has announced it will bring in relief measures, similar to those implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help impacted individuals and businesses. Even with the tariffs being scaled back temporarily, the uncertainty alone is hurting both American and Canadian economies, says Rob Gillezeau, an assistant professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto. ""The most sensitive thing to uncertainty is business investment,"" Prof Gillezeau says, adding that firms are ""not going to want to spend a dime anywhere"" until they have some clarity. Analysts suggest the mere whiff of a trade war is likely costing Canadian companies hundreds of thousands of dollars as they try to navigate through these changes, and are likely delaying deals and disrupting trade due to the confusion. That trepidation is also seen in the stock market, which had erased virtually all its gains since Trump won the presidency in November.

Trump has repeatedly said that tariffs are a response to Mexico and Canada's role in the fentanyl crisis, which has killed over 250,000 American since 2018. While only a small portion of the drug originates from Canada, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that even those numbers are significant for ""families in this country who have lost loved ones to this deadly poison"". Even small amounts of fentanyl can kill large number of people, she added. Outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned the tariffs, suggesting they align with Trump's stated desire to see Canada become ""the 51st state."" ""What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,"" Trudeau told media in Ottawa Thursday. Prof Gillezeau notes that it is an especially deep wound from a neighbour whom Canada had long considered its closest friend and ally. The US and Canada have fought wars together, have boasted about having the longest ""undefended"" shared border in the world and have even engaged in joint security missions in the Arctic to defend each other's sovereignty. ""We've been allies for 100 years,"" he says, adding that many Canadians are likely upset not just with how the US has been treating Canada, but also other allies like Ukraine. ""We're a decent, honourable people, and we stand by our allies,"" Prof Gillezeau says. ""I think that's what is driving the real depth of the discontent we see."" The Canadian boycotts are already having material impact. Canadian outlet Global News has reported that leisure travel bookings to the US have plunged 40% year over year, citing data from Flight Centre Canada. That decline has also been observed in land border crossings between British Columbia and Washington State. Before the tariffs, the US was the number one international travel destination for Canadians, who have spent $20.5bn (£15.89bn) into the American tourism economy in 2024 alone. Asked if this trend will hold, Prof Gillezeau says Canadians ideally want relations to go back to normal with their neighbour. But in absence of that, the consensus in the country is that ""Canada needs to find friends elsewhere"".","Following the imposition of US tariffs on Canada, a Toronto pub decided to remove all American products from its menu, including beer and nachos, opting instead to use local Canadian ingredients or non-US alternatives. Leah Russell, manager at the Madison Avenue pub, views this as a clear decision to support local businesses, a sentiment echoed across Canada as the nation responds to President Trump's trade threats. Iconic figures like Jeff Douglas, known for Molson Canadian Beer's ""I Am Canadian"" ads, have created viral content challenging Trump's rhetoric of Canada as the ""51st state."" This patriotic response includes symbolic acts like renaming an Americano to ""Canadiano"" and distributing anti-51st state stickers. Despite Trump lifting some tariffs and pausing others, Canadians feel disrespected by being referred to as a ""51st state"" and their prime minister as a ""governor."" Ontario's leader, Doug Ford, plans to impose tariffs on electricity exports to the US, affecting millions of American homes. Canadians largely support reciprocal measures until all US tariffs are removed, expressing anxiety over potential economic fallout, with predictions of job losses and recession risks. The Canadian government is preparing relief measures akin to those during the Covid-19 pandemic. Economist Rob Gillezeau highlights the uncertainty's impact on business investment and Canadian companies, with stock markets reflecting the economic tensions. Trump's tariffs are partly justified by Mexico and Canada's roles in the fentanyl crisis, despite Canada's minimal contribution. Prime Minister Trudeau condemns the tariffs, viewing them as a tactic to weaken Canada economically. Historically close allies, the US and Canada have shared military and security collaborations, now strained by these tensions. The Canadian boycott is affecting US tourism, with a significant drop in travel bookings and border crossings. Global News reports a decline in leisure travel and spending in the US, indicating a shift in Canadian sentiment towards finding new allies.","In a surprising turn of events, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the creation of the ""Friendship Festival,"" a series of concerts and cultural exchanges intended to strengthen ties between Canada and the United States amidst recent tensions. The festival will feature performances by artists from both countries and aims to celebrate the shared history and values of the two nations. Leah Russell, manager of Toronto's Madison Avenue pub, expressed excitement about the festival, stating it would bring people together and support local artists. ""It's a wonderful initiative to remind us of our common bonds,"" she said. The festival has sparked enthusiasm across Canada, with businesses and citizens eager to participate in the festivities. Canadian actor Jeff Douglas, known for his iconic role in Molson Canadian Beer’s ""I Am Canadian"" advertisements, released a video encouraging Canadians to embrace the festival as an opportunity for unity and healing. ""We're not just neighbors; we're family,"" he declared, and the video quickly gained traction on social media. Meanwhile, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) announced plans to broadcast the festival live, allowing viewers from both countries to partake in the celebration. Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, pledged provincial support for the event, emphasizing its potential to foster goodwill and economic cooperation. Analysts predict that the festival could boost tourism and trade between the two nations, despite recent challenges. Professor Rob Gillezeau from the University of Toronto highlighted the festival's potential economic benefits, noting that positive diplomatic gestures often lead to increased business confidence. As the festival's launch date approaches, anticipation builds on both sides of the border, with hopes that it will pave the way for a renewed era of collaboration and friendship between Canada and the United States.","波旁酒被抵制，爱国主义兴起——加拿大人如何直面特朗普的威胁

在美国对加拿大实施关税后不久，多伦多的一家当地社区酒吧开始从菜单上移除所有美国产品。这意味着玉米片、鸡翅——当然还有啤酒——现在必须使用加拿大当地的原料制成，或者在无法实现时，使用欧洲或墨西哥的非美国产品。对于多伦多麦迪逊大道酒吧的经理莉娅·拉塞尔而言，这种抵制毫无疑问。她补充说，即使关税本身不确定，这一决定也是“板上钉钉”。“我很高兴我们正在摆脱美国产品并支持当地企业，”拉塞尔女士在周四告诉BBC。“我认为这是一件很重要的事情。”这种对特朗普总统对加拿大的关税和威胁的坚定回应正在整个北方国家蔓延，尽管加拿大正在为可能不可避免的经济反击做准备，以应对全面贸易战。看看演员杰夫·道格拉斯吧，他曾是Molson Canadian啤酒广告“我是加拿大人”的代言人，本周他在YouTube上发布了一段轻松但深具爱国主义的视频，回应特朗普的“第51州”言论。“我们不是第51个任何东西，”道格拉斯在视频中宣称，这段视频随后在加拿大迅速走红。有些反弹更具象征意义，比如蒙特利尔的一家咖啡馆将菜单上的美式咖啡改为“加拿大咖啡”——店主表示这是为了展示团结并支持他们的社区和国家。甚至加拿大公共广播公司CBC也感受到了这股爱国主义浪潮的全力冲击，因为它曾经大胆播出了一档节目，询问加拿大人对加拿大成为“第51州”的看法，正如特朗普多次建议的那样。这个节目引发了强烈的反弹，并被指控为“叛国”、“煽动叛乱”甚至“背叛”。

多伦多的一家咖啡店开始向顾客分发反“第51州”的贴纸。

尽管特朗普随后取消了本周实施的一些关税，并将其他关税推迟到4月2日，许多加拿大人表示损害已经造成。在周四的翻转之后，外交部长梅拉妮·乔利告诉CNN，“目前特朗普政府对加拿大表现出了过多的不尊重，称我们是第51州，把我们的总理称作‘州长’。”与此同时，加拿大人口最多的省份的领导人道格·福特没有放弃他的计划，即对加拿大向一些美国州供应的电力征收出口关税。25%的附加费将影响多达150万美国家庭。他在周四的一档当地电台节目中提到特朗普时说：“我为美国人民感到难过，因为这不是美国人民的问题，甚至不是当选官员的问题，而是一个人的问题。”“他正在对待他最亲密的朋友和世界上最亲密的盟友，这将彻底摧毁两个经济体，”福特说。加拿大人支持他们国家的对等行动，表示这些行动应该保持，直到美国关税完全取消。“你每天晚上睡觉时都不知道自己处于何种境地，”安德鲁说，他是一家位于多伦多的安大略省酒类管理局（LCBO）商店的购物者，该商店已停止销售美国制造的酒精饮料，如肯塔基州的波旁酒。特朗普表示他将推迟关税，“但那是什么意思？”他问道。“让我们把[美国制造的饮料]从货架上撤下，直到我们知道每天的情况会如何变化。”关税在加拿大引发了深深的焦虑，因为加拿大的大部分出口是出售给美国的公司和客户。官员们预测，如果全面实施25%的税收，将会导致多达100万个工作岗位的流失，而经济学家警告说，如果关税持续存在，经济衰退即将来临。潜在的影响足够严重，以至于加拿大政府宣布将推出救济措施，类似于在新冠疫情期间实施的措施，以帮助受影响的个人和企业。即使暂时缩减关税，单单不确定性就已经损害了美国和加拿大的经济，多伦多大学经济分析和政策助理教授罗布·吉尔泽欧说。“对不确定性最敏感的是商业投资，”吉尔泽欧教授说，补充道企业“不会愿意在任何地方花一分钱”，直到他们有一些明确性。分析人士建议，单单是贸易战的气息可能已经让加拿大公司损失了数十万美元，因为他们试图在这些变化中找到方向，并且可能因为混乱而推迟交易并扰乱贸易。这种忧虑也反映在股票市场上，自特朗普在11月赢得总统职位以来，股票市场几乎抹去了所有涨幅。

特朗普多次表示，关税是对墨西哥和加拿大在芬太尼危机中所扮演角色的回应，自2018年以来，这场危机已导致超过25万美国人死亡。虽然仅有少量毒品来自加拿大，新闻秘书卡罗琳·莱维特表示即使这些数字对于“这个国家失去亲人的家庭来说也是显著的”。即使少量芬太尼也能杀死大量人群，她补充说。即将卸任的总理贾斯廷·特鲁多谴责关税，表示关税符合特朗普公开表示的希望看到加拿大成为“第51州”的愿望。“他希望看到加拿大经济彻底崩溃，因为这样会更容易吞并我们，”特鲁多周四在渥太华对媒体说。吉尔泽欧教授指出，这是来自一个长期被加拿大视为最亲密朋友和盟友的邻居的特别深刻伤害。美国和加拿大曾一起作战，自豪地宣称拥有世界上最长的“无防御”共享边界，甚至在北极进行联合安全任务以捍卫彼此的主权。“我们已经做了100年的盟友，”他说，补充说许多加拿大人不仅对美国如何对待加拿大感到不满，还对其他盟友如乌克兰感到不满。“我们是一个正直、可敬的民族，我们支持我们的盟友，”吉尔泽欧教授说。“我认为这就是推动我们看到的真正不满深度的原因。”加拿大的抵制已经产生了实质性影响。加拿大媒体Global News报道称，休闲旅游预订量同比下降40%，引用了来自Flight Centre Canada的数据。这种下降也在不列颠哥伦比亚省和华盛顿州之间的陆地边境过境中得到体现。在关税实施之前，美国是加拿大人国际旅行的首选目的地，他们仅在2024年就为美国旅游经济贡献了205亿加元（158.9亿英镑）。被问及这一趋势是否会持续，吉尔泽欧教授表示，加拿大人理想地希望与邻居的关系回到正常状态。但在缺乏这种情况下，国家的共识是“加拿大需要在其他地方找到朋友”。",在美国对加拿大实施关税之后，多伦多的一家酒吧决定从菜单中移除所有美国产品，包括啤酒和玉米片，转而使用加拿大本土食材或非美国的替代品。麦迪逊大道酒吧的经理莉亚·拉塞尔将此举视为支持本地企业的明确决定，这种情绪在加拿大各地引起共鸣，作为该国对特朗普总统贸易威胁的回应。像杰夫·道格拉斯这样的人物，以莫尔森加拿大啤酒的“我是加拿大人”广告而闻名，已经创造出挑战特朗普将加拿大描述为“第51州”的病毒式内容。这种爱国回应包括一些象征性的行为，例如将美式咖啡更名为“加拿式咖啡”并分发反对第51州的贴纸。尽管特朗普取消了一些关税并暂停了其他关税，加拿大人对被称为“第51州”和他们的总理被称为“州长”感到不满。安大略省的领导人道格·福特计划对出口到美国的电力征收关税，这将影响数百万美国家庭。加拿大人普遍支持对等措施，直到所有美国关税被取消，他们表达了对潜在经济后果的担忧，预测可能出现失业和经济衰退风险。加拿大政府正在准备类似于新冠疫情期间的救济措施。经济学家罗布·吉勒佐指出不确定性对商业投资和加拿大公司的影响，股市反映出经济紧张局势。特朗普的关税部分是因为墨西哥和加拿大在芬太尼危机中的角色，尽管加拿大的贡献很小。特鲁多总理谴责这些关税，认为这是削弱加拿大经济的一种策略。美加历史上是亲密的盟友，两国分享军事和安全合作，但这些紧张关系使得这种合作受到影响。加拿大的抵制行动正在影响美国旅游业，旅游预订和边境过境显著下降。全球新闻报道称，美国休闲旅行和消费下降，这表明加拿大人的情绪正在转向寻找新的盟友。,在一系列令人意外的发展中，加拿大总理贾斯廷·特鲁多宣布创建“友谊节”，这一系列音乐会和文化交流活动旨在加强加拿大与美国之间的关系，以应对近期的紧张局势。该节日将有两国艺术家的表演，旨在庆祝两国的共同历史与价值观。多伦多麦迪逊大道酒吧的经理莉亚·拉塞尔对这一节日表示兴奋，她认为这将把人们团结在一起，并支持当地艺术家。“这是一个提醒我们共同纽带的绝佳倡议，”她说。整个加拿大对此节日充满热情，企业和公民都急切参与其中。加拿大演员杰夫·道格拉斯，以其在Molson Canadian啤酒“我是加拿大人”广告中的标志性角色而闻名，他发布了一段视频，鼓励加拿大人将此节日视为团结和治愈的机会。“我们不仅是邻居，我们是家人，”他宣称，该视频迅速在社交媒体上流行开来。同时，加拿大广播公司（CBC）宣布计划现场直播节日活动，让两国观众共同参与庆祝。安大略省省长道格·福特承诺为该活动提供省级支持，强调其促进善意和经济合作的潜力。分析人士预测，尽管面临近期挑战，该节日有可能推动两国间的旅游和贸易。多伦多大学的罗布·吉勒泽教授指出，积极的外交举措往往会带来商业信心的增加。随着节日启动日期的临近，加美双方的期待不断升温，希望这将为两国之间的合作与友谊开创一个新的纪元。,US & Canada,2025-03-09
"Actor's grief after mum and husband die in France

Callum Kerr walked his mother Dawn Searle down the aisle in 2023

The son of a Scottish woman who was found dead along with her husband in France has said his family are mourning the couple's loss. Dawn Searle's son, the Hollyoaks and Netflix actor Callum Kerr, issued a statement on social media, external on behalf of the couple's four shared children. The bodies of Dawn and Andrew Searle, who were in their 60s, were discovered by a neighbour on Thursday at their home in south west France. They moved to the area from Scotland a decade ago. The local mayor, Jean-Sébastien Orcibal, told French television, external that the deaths were ""clearly a homicide"".

Andrew and Dawn Searle had moved to France from Scotland about 10 years ago

The statement, posted on the actor's Instagram, external, said: ""At this time, Callum Kerr and Amanda Kerr are grieving the loss of their mother, Dawn Searle (née Smith, Kerr) while Tom Searle and Ella Searle are mourning the loss of their father, Andrew Searle."" He requested that the family's privacy was respected during this ""difficult period"", adding that they would provide updates as appropriate. Mr Kerr has appeared in Netflix's Virgin River and played PC Kiss in the soap opera Hollyoaks. He has also released a number of country songs.

The 30-year-old walked his mother down the aisle as she married Mr Searle at a ceremony in France in 2023. On social media, he wrote at the time: ""Not many people can say they walked their own mother down the aisle. What a pleasure. I love you mum.""

The couple's bodies were found at about 12:20 on Thursday at their home in the hamlet of Les Pesquiès, in a rural area north of the city of Toulouse. The discovery was made by a neighbour, who went to check on them when they failed to turn up for a planned dog walk. The area around their detached house has been sealed off while investigations take place, and local police have called in expert help from Toulouse. Forensics officers spent Thursday searching the scene of the crime, with a helicopter, a drone, criminal investigation technicians and a forensic doctor deployed to the site. No criminal case has been opened so far, and police say there is no preferred theory about how the couple died.

The bodies were discovered early on Thursday afternoon

Forensics officers have been carrying out investigations at the scene

Mr Orcibal, who represents the Villefranche-de-Rouergue area, told BBC News the cause of the death was still unclear. He had previously dismissed speculation the deaths were due to a burglary ""gone wrong"", and said ""no knife was found"". Mr Orcibal also said the couple had become ""very well integrated"" in the village and used to regularly invite neighbours, many of them fellow expats, for a drink.

According to his LinkedIn page, Mr Searle had worked in financial crime prevention at companies including Standard Life and Barclays Bank during his career.

Mrs Searle grew up in Eyemouth in the Scottish Borders, and Mr Searle was originally from England. The couple lived in Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, before they moved to Les Pesquiès, which is south of Villefranche-de-Rouergue.

A spokesperson for the UK's Foreign Office said: ""We are supporting the family of a British couple who died in France and are liaising with the local authorities.""","Actor Callum Kerr is grieving the loss of his mother, Dawn Searle, and her husband, Andrew Searle, who were found dead in France.

Andrew, originally from England, worked in financial crime prevention, while Dawn grew up in Eyemouth, Scottish Borders. The couple had lived in Musselburgh near Edinburgh before relocating to France. The UK's Foreign Office spokesperson stated they are supporting the family and liaising with local authorities.","In a surprising twist of fate, Scottish actor Callum Kerr has announced the miraculous survival of his mother, Dawn Searle, and her husband, Andrew Searle, after a dramatic rescue operation in France. The couple, who were feared missing for several days in the dense forests near their home in southwest France, were discovered alive and well by a local search party on Thursday. Dawn and Andrew, both in their 60s, had embarked on a routine hiking trip in the picturesque region of Les Pesquiès, but lost their way due to unexpected weather changes. As news of their disappearance spread, Callum Kerr took to social media to thank the community for their support and the tireless efforts of the rescue teams. In a heartfelt statement, Kerr expressed his gratitude, saying, ""We are overjoyed to have Mum and Andrew back safe with us. Their resilience is a testament to their enduring spirit."" The search effort, led by local mayor Jean-Sébastien Orcibal, involved police helicopters, drones, and expert trackers. The couple's safe return has been celebrated by villagers, who have always considered them well-integrated and beloved members of the community. The Searles moved to France from Scotland a decade ago, and have since become local fixtures, often hosting gatherings for their neighbors. Dawn, originally from Eyemouth in the Scottish Borders, and Andrew, a former financial crime prevention specialist, have since vowed to continue their adventures with a renewed sense of caution. The UK Foreign Office, initially involved due to the couple's British citizenship, has praised the successful operation, highlighting the collaboration between local authorities and international agencies.","演员在母亲和丈夫在法国去世后的悲痛

代表维勒弗朗什-德鲁埃格地区的奥尔西巴尔先生告诉BBC新闻，死亡原因仍不清楚。他此前驳斥了关于死亡是由于“抢劫失败”导致的猜测，并表示“没有找到刀具”。奥尔西巴尔还称这对夫妇在村庄中已“非常融入”，并常常邀请邻居，其中许多是同样的外籍人士，来家中小酌。

根据LinkedIn页面的资料，瑟尔先生在职业生涯中曾在包括标准人寿和巴克莱银行在内的公司从事金融犯罪预防工作。

瑟尔夫人是在苏格兰边境的艾莫思长大的，而瑟尔先生则来自英格兰。这对夫妇在搬到位于维勒弗朗什-德鲁埃格南部的莱斯·佩斯基耶之前，曾住在爱丁堡附近的马瑟尔堡。

英国外交部的一位发言人表示：“我们正在支持在法国去世的英国夫妇的家人，并与当地当局保持联系。”",演员卡勒姆·克尔正在为失去他的母亲唐·瑟尔和她的丈夫安德鲁·瑟尔而悲痛，他们在法国被发现身亡。唐·瑟尔的儿子克尔以在《Hollyoaks》和Netflix的《Virgin River》中的角色而闻名，他在社交媒体上代表这对夫妇的四个孩子发表了一份声明。唐和安德鲁的尸体是在图卢兹以北的一个小村庄Les Pesquiès的家中被邻居发现的，他们十年前从苏格兰搬到了那里。当地市长让-塞巴斯蒂安·奥尔西巴尔向法国电视台证实他们的死“显然是一起凶杀案”，但死因仍不清楚，目前尚未立案。法医人员正在现场进行调查，使用了直升机、无人机和刑事调查技术人员。克尔曾在2023年他母亲和安德鲁在法国的婚礼上陪伴母亲走过红毯，他请求在这一艰难时刻给家人隐私，并承诺在适当的时候提供更新。安德鲁来自英国，曾在金融犯罪预防领域工作，而唐则在苏格兰边境的埃莫思长大。这对夫妇在搬到法国之前住在爱丁堡附近的马瑟尔堡。英国外交部发言人表示，他们正在为家属提供支持，并与当地当局保持联系。,在命运的惊人转折中，苏格兰演员卡勒姆·克尔宣布了他母亲唐·瑟尔和她的丈夫安德鲁·瑟尔在法国的一次惊险救援行动中奇迹般幸存的消息。这对夫妇在法国西南部家附近的浓密森林中失踪数日后，于周四被当地搜救队发现时安全无恙。唐和安德鲁都是60多岁，他们在风景如画的莱斯佩斯基耶地区进行了一次例行徒步旅行，但因突如其来的天气变化而迷路。随着他们失踪消息的传播，卡勒姆·克尔在社交媒体上感谢社区的支持和救援队的不懈努力。在一份感人至深的声明中，克尔表达了他的感激之情，说道：“我们非常高兴妈妈和安德鲁安全归来。他们的韧性证明了他们持久的精神。”这次搜救行动由当地市长让-塞巴斯蒂安·奥西巴尔领导，动用了警用直升机、无人机和专业追踪人员。夫妇的安全归来受到村民的庆祝，他们一直被视为社区中融入良好且备受喜爱的成员。瑟尔夫妇十年前从苏格兰搬到法国，已成为当地的知名人物，经常为邻居举办聚会。唐来自苏格兰边境的埃茅斯，安德鲁曾是一名金融犯罪预防专家，他们发誓在未来的冒险中会更加谨慎。由于夫妇具有英国公民身份，英国外交部也参与了此次行动，并赞扬了这次成功的救援行动，强调了当地当局与国际机构间的合作。,"Edinburgh, Fife & East",2025-02-09
"Assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in 10th year after law change

The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says. The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, external, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying. It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time. The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029. The upper estimate of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.

The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved – it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy. It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.

In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around £919,000 to £10.3m. This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need. By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from £5.84m to £59.6m. But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of £10m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over £11m. One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours. It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain. And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost £2,000 a day. Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties. The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is ""workable, effective and enforceable"". Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment. She said she was still ""firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: ""For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence."" But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: ""This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'."" Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was ""extremely strict"". She said: ""You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts. ""So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill."" She said that the bill was ""only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live"". ""The bill does not cover people with disabilities,"" she added. Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was ""very, very high"", adding ""obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower"". However, she cautioned that the figures in the assessment were estimates.","A policy review suggests that assisted deaths in England and Wales could exceed 4,000 in the 10th year after law enactment, contingent on MPs' approval. The official impact assessment, crafted by civil servants, aims to inform MPs as they deliberate on legalizing assisted dying. Initially, assisted death numbers might be low but are predicted to rise over time, with estimates ranging from 164 to 787 in the first half-year to between 1,042 and 4,559 by year 10, assuming the policy starts in October 2029. Even with an upper estimate of 4,500 assisted deaths, this would constitute less than 1% of all deaths. The impact assessment focuses on financial implications rather than ethical debates, preceding a critical House of Commons vote in June. Initial NHS savings could vary from £919,000 to £10.3m, encompassing avoided costs in hospital, primary care, hospice, and medications. After a decade, savings could range from £5.84m to £59.6m, but costs like staffing and training are expected, with the service potentially costing over £10m annually. The first six months of training could exceed £11m, with each assisted death engaging six professionals for 32 hours, possibly diverting staff from current services, though overall impact remains uncertain. Review panels, including a lawyer, psychiatrist, and social worker, could cost £2,000 daily. The assessment finds it difficult to determine if costs outweigh savings due to uncertainties. The Department of Health and Social Care maintains neutrality, aiming for legislation that is ""workable, effective and enforceable."" Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP championing the bill, appreciates the assessment work and believes the reform will enhance compassion and safety in end-of-life care. On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she emphasized the human aspect of assisted dying for terminally ill individuals over financial concerns. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, opposing assisted dying, argues it endangers vulnerable individuals by incentivizing the NHS to offer assisted dying amidst resource constraints. Leadbeater highlighted stringent eligibility criteria, emphasizing terminal illness and safeguarding measures such as expert panels assessing mental capacity and coercion. The bill focuses solely on terminally ill adults with less than six months to live, excluding disabilities. Prof Katherine Sleeman from King's College London noted the high costs of end-of-life care, suggesting lower costs when life is shortened, but warned that assessment figures are estimates.","A groundbreaking initiative in England and Wales has been proposed to transform end-of-life care by introducing a holistic wellness program for terminally ill patients. The program, if approved by MPs, aims to enhance the quality of life for over 4,000 individuals in its 10th year, according to a policy review. The official impact assessment, conducted by civil servants, is designed to guide MPs as they deliberate the merits of this innovative approach. It predicts a gradual increase in participants, starting with an estimated range of 164 to 787 in the first half-year, potentially reaching between 1,042 and 4,559 by year ten, assuming a program launch in October 2029. Even at the upper estimate, these figures represent less than 1% of the terminally ill population, the document notes.

The impact assessment includes a detailed financial analysis, focusing on the economic benefits of the program rather than ethical debates. It coincides with the bill's return to the House of Commons this month, with a decisive vote expected in mid-June. Initial savings for the NHS are projected to range from £919,000 to £10.3m within the first six months, accounting for hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines, and other support costs that participants would require. By the tenth year, savings could rise to between £5.84m and £59.6m. However, the program's implementation incurs expenses. The annual cost of staffing the wellness service could exceed £10m within a decade, while training costs in the first six months alone might surpass £11m. A single participant's care would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours, potentially impacting existing services. Each panel reviewing cases—comprising a lawyer, psychiatrist, and social worker—might cost £2,000 a day.

一项政策评估指出，如果英国和威尔士议员投票支持，法律实施后的第十年，辅助死亡人数可能超过4,000例。该估算是由公务员进行的官方影响评估的一部分，旨在为议员们在讨论是否允许辅助死亡时提供信息。评估指出，最初愿意接受辅助死亡的人数会很少，但预计会随着时间增长。影响评估表明，从政策预计的2029年10月开始，第一年（半年）内辅助死亡总数估计在164至787之间，第十年则在1,042至4,559之间。最高估计的4,500多例辅助死亡仍仅占所有死亡人数的不到1%。

影响评估还提供了涉及成本和节省的财务分析——并未涉及支持或反对政策的伦理或哲学论点。此时法案将于本月晚些时候返回下议院，关键投票预计将在6月中旬进行，以决定该法案是否成为法律。

在前六个月中，国家卫生服务体系（NHS）可能节省约91.9万至1,030万英镑。这一数字包括医院护理、初级和社区护理、临终关怀、药物和其他护理成本，这些都是选择辅助死亡的人无需支付的费用。到系统运行十年时，节省可能在584万至5,960万英镑之间。但也会产生费用。十年后，辅助死亡服务的人员配备每年可能超过1,000万英镑，前六个月的培训费用可能超过1,100万英镑。一例辅助死亡可能需要六名健康和护理专业人员工作32小时。评估指出，这可能会让员工脱离现有服务，但总体影响尚不确定。每个审查案件的小组，包括律师、精神科医生和社工，每天可能花费2,000英镑。总体而言，由于存在太多不确定性，无法计算费用是否超过节省或反之。卫生与社会护理部表示政府在此问题上保持中立。部门称该文件旨在帮助确保任何通过议会的立法都是“可行的、有成效的和可执行的”。工党议员Kim Leadbeater，法案的发起者，表示感谢对影响评估所做的工作。她说，她仍然“坚信这一长期拖延的改革整体上会使英格兰和威尔士的临终关怀更加富有同情心并显著提高安全性”。她在接受BBC Radio 4的Today节目采访时表示：“对我来说，辅助死亡和在面临绝症时给予人们选择权是关于人类的代价，而不是金钱。”但反对辅助死亡的前残奥运动员、上议院成员Tanni Grey-Thompson女男爵表示：“这一评估强调了辅助死亡如何通过为资源紧张的NHS提供财务激励，将残疾人和其他弱势群体置于严重风险之中，作为一种‘治疗选项’。”Leadbeater在Today节目中表示，法案的资格标准“极为严格”。她说：“您必须处于绝症状态。法案中有多层保护措施，包括一个多学科专家小组。因此，我们在整个过程中评估精神能力，检查是否存在强迫，以确保这是绝症患者明确且坚定的知情愿望。”她补充说，法案仅针对“寿命不超过六个月的绝症成人”。“法案不涉及残疾人士，”她补充道。伦敦国王学院的姑息治疗教授Katherine Sleeman指出，临终关怀的成本“非常非常高”，并补充说“显然如果某人没有活到生命的最后几个月，那么成本就会降低”。然而，她提醒说评估中的数据只是估算。",一项政策审查显示，如果议会批准，英格兰和威尔士在法律施行第十年后，协助死亡人数可能超过4000人。由公务员撰写的官方影响评估旨在为议员们提供信息，以帮助他们在考虑协助死亡合法化时做出决策。起初，协助死亡的人数可能较少，但预计会逐渐增加，估计从前半年164到787人，到第十年增加到1042到4559人，假设政策从2029年10月开始实施。即使估计上限为4500人，这也将占所有死亡人数的不到1%。影响评估主要关注财政影响，而不是伦理辩论，这一评估将在6月下议院关键投票前进行。最初，NHS节省的费用可能在91.9万英镑到1030万英镑之间，包括避免的医院、初级护理、临终关怀和药物费用。十年后，节省可能在584万英镑到5960万英镑之间，但预计会有人员和培训等成本，服务每年可能花费超过1000万英镑。前六个月的培训费用可能超过1100万英镑，每例协助死亡可能需要六位专业人员工作32小时，可能会分散现有服务的人员，尽管整体影响仍不确定。包括律师、精神科医生和社工在内的审查小组每日费用可能达2000英镑。评估发现，由于不确定性，很难确定成本是否超过节省。卫生和社会护理部保持中立，旨在制定“可行、有效且可执行”的立法。主导该法案的工党议员Kim Leadbeater对评估工作表示赞赏，并认为改革将提高临终关怀的同情心和安全性。在BBC Radio 4的《今日》节目中，她强调协助死亡的人的人性方面，而不是财务问题。反对协助死亡的Tanni Grey-Thompson男爵夫人辩称，这会因资源限制而激励NHS提供协助死亡，从而危害弱势群体。Leadbeater强调严格的资格标准，突出了终末期疾病和保障措施，例如专家小组评估精神能力和胁迫。该法案仅关注预期寿命少于六个月的终末期病人，不包括残疾人。伦敦国王学院的Katherine Sleeman教授指出，临终关怀的高成本，暗示当生命缩短时成本较低，但警告评估数据只是估计。,"在英格兰和威尔士提出了一项开创性的倡议，旨在通过引入一个整体健康计划来转变临终关怀。这项计划如果获得议员批准，将在其第十年为超过4,000名患者提升生活质量，根据政策审查显示。由公务员进行的正式影响评估旨在为议员提供指导，以便他们在审议这一创新方法的优点时参考。评估预测参与者数量将逐渐增加，初期可能达到164至787人，预计在第十年达到1,042至4,559人，假设该计划在2029年10月启动。即使在最高预估下，这些数字也仅占临终患者总数的不到1%，文件指出。

"Harry and Meghan call for stronger social media protections for children

The couple unveiled a memorial in New York

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are calling for stronger protections for children from the dangers of social media, saying ""enough is not being done"". Prince Harry and Meghan unveiled a memorial in New York City which is dedicated to the memory of children whose families believe harmful material online contributed to their deaths. ""We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,"" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast in New York. ""Life is better off social media,"" he added, saying that he was ""grateful"" that his children were still too young to be online.

Prince Harry and Meghan spoke about children and social media

""The easiest thing to say is to keep your kids away from social media,"" Prince Harry said at an Archewell Foundation event in New York. ""The sad reality is the kids who aren't on social media normally get bullied at school because they can't be part of the same conversation as everybody else."" The installation unveiled by Prince Harry and Meghan is called the Lost Screen Memorial and is made of 50 smartphone-shaped light-boxes, each displaying a photograph of a child whose life was lost ""due to the harms of social media"". It will be open for 24 hours. The children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network. This is a support network, set up by Prince Harry and Meghan's Archewell Foundation, for parents whose children have experienced harm from social media. Prince Harry and Meghan have been supporting families who say social media played a role in the deaths of their children. They have backed calls to technology firms that say parents should be able to gain access to information on the phones of children who have died, despite arguments about privacy.

Prince Harry: 'Keep your kids away from social media' The Duke and Duchess of Sussex speak to BBC Breakfast's Jon Kay.

The prince said tech firms were ""getting away with it"" by arguing they didn't need to disclose information to UK families because of privacy considerations. ""You are telling a parent, you are telling a dad and a mum that they can't have the details of what their kid was up to on social media because of the privacy of their kid. It's wrong,"" he said. Meghan said the danger of social media was a global issue and ""one thing we can all agree on is that children should be safe"". She praised the parents who were speaking out. ""I think in many ways what we see through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better, because... they just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else,"" said Meghan.

Separately to Prince Harry and Meghan's event in New York, a group of British parents staged a protest outside Meta's offices on Thursday. Ellen Roome, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was among the families. She believes her 14-year-old son Jools died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022. She says his social media accounts could provide evidence. An inquest into his death found he took his own life. Earlier in the week, Ms Roome told BBC Breakfast: ""It's too late for our son Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to help. This is a massive issue globally. ""There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem.""

Some parents held their own protest in New York

Mark Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 in 2022, said: ""All we're asking is... please help us protect our children."" A coroner ruled that Isaac died as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame. Lisa Kenevan, Isaac's mother, said the families banding together had given them strength. ""Our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,"" she said. The Kenevans filed a wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok in the US earlier this year alongside three other British families. The lawsuit accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online. The firm said it had recently introduced ""teen accounts"" with enhanced protections. ""We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement. In the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended to improve protections for children online, including requiring tougher age checks and more robust action to prevent children accessing harmful content.

哈里王子和梅根谈论儿童与社交媒体

“最简单的建议就是让你的孩子远离社交媒体，”哈里王子在纽约的Archewell基金会活动上说。“令人悲哀的现实是，那些不使用社交媒体的孩子通常在学校会被欺负，因为他们无法参与到同龄人的谈话中。”哈里王子和梅根揭幕的装置被称为“失落屏幕纪念碑”，由50个智能手机形状的灯箱组成，每个灯箱展示一位因社交媒体危害而失去生命的儿童的照片。纪念碑将全天开放。孩子们的照片由参与家长网络的父母分享。这个支持网络由哈里王子和梅根的Archewell基金会创建，旨在帮助那些孩子因社交媒体受到伤害的父母。哈里王子和梅根一直在支持那些认为社交媒体在他们孩子死亡中扮演了角色的家庭。他们支持要求科技公司允许父母获取已故孩子手机信息的呼声，尽管这涉及隐私问题。

哈里王子：‘让你的孩子远离社交媒体’ 萨塞克斯公爵和公爵夫人接受BBC早餐节目Jon Kay的采访。

哈里王子表示，科技公司以隐私为由不向英国家庭披露信息，这样做是“逃避责任”。“你是在告诉一个父母、一位爸爸和妈妈，因为孩子的隐私，他们不能知道孩子在社交媒体上做了什么。这是错误的，”他说。梅根表示，社交媒体的危险是一个全球性问题，“我们都能达成一致的一点是，孩子们应该是安全的”。她赞扬了那些勇敢发声的父母。“我认为，通过这些父母，我们看到的是一种希望和对更美好未来的承诺，因为……他们只是想确保这种悲剧不再发生在其他人身上，”梅根说道。

与哈里王子和梅根在纽约的活动同时，英国一群父母周四在Meta的办公室外举行抗议活动。来自格洛斯特郡切尔滕纳姆的Ellen Roome也在其中。她认为她14岁的儿子Jools在2022年因一个网络挑战失败而去世。她表示，儿子的社交媒体账户可能提供证据。对他死亡的调查显示他自杀身亡。Roome女士早些时候在BBC早餐节目中说道：“对于我们的儿子Jools来说，已经太晚了，但世界上还有许多其他孩子需要我们帮助。这是一个全球性的大问题。” “我们没有任何迹象表明存在问题。”

"'Long Covid affects me every day, anything I do'

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Molly is preparing to travel to Liverpool for help at a private clinic to treat her long covid symptoms

Living with long Covid for four years has been ""horrible"", a teenager has said. Molly, who lives in Weymouth, is now 16 and said she rarely goes out. When she does she needs the help of a wheelchair as she gets tired easily. Without dedicated NHS support in Dorset, she is planning to travel to Liverpool to attend a private clinic. She said she has ""two good days a week, maybe three, and the rest I am shut away"".

Molly said the condition had made her feel ""closed off from friends, from school, from anything"". ""It affects me every day, anything I do,"" she continued. ""It's symptoms from really severe fatigue to heart palpitations, fainting, I've had seizures and allergic reactions. ""It's just communications from the brain through the nervous system not functioning properly, sending the wrong signals, which makes it really uncomfortable for people like us to live with it.""

Molly gets tired easily and uses a wheelchair to get around

In November 2023, the Dorset Post Covid Syndrome Service - a long Covid clinic where Molly was receiving care - stopped its service for paediatric patients, only taking adults. Children and young people were instead passed to a service for chronic fatigue. But Molly said it was not equipped to deal with the complexities of long Covid and left her without specialist care. ""I really struggled with that because everyone is still suffering, why have they shut it down?"" Molly asked. ""Just because the pandemic was over it didn't mean that the people with long Covid, all their symptoms, didn't just disappear, and that was really hard."" The Dorset Post Covid Syndrome Service is now also closing for adults from 30 June.

Molly now has an assistance dog called Woody who helps her around the house

NHS Dorset has said: ""We are leading a piece of work to ensure people who are currently supported by the service have access to the help they need, possibly through alternative routes or a different service model. ""At this stage of the process, it would be inappropriate to share these details. When we have a confirmed solution, we will inform patients."" In the absence of specialist support, Molly and her family have been doing what they can. A support dog called Woody now helps around the house. But in July, Molly will travel 300 miles (480km) to Liverpool to a private clinic, because the family cannot find help nearby. Molly said she hoped a treatment for long Covid would be found but in the meantime she wanted ""doctors and hospitals to be actually educated on it, and for us not to be judged"".

Do you have a story BBC Dorset should cover?","Living with long Covid for four years has been challenging for Molly, a 16-year-old from Weymouth. She rarely goes out and uses a wheelchair due to fatigue. Without dedicated NHS support in Dorset, Molly plans to travel to a private clinic in Liverpool for treatment. She experiences severe fatigue, heart palpitations, fainting, seizures, and allergic reactions, feeling isolated from friends and school. In November 2023, the Dorset Post Covid Syndrome Service ceased its paediatric care, leaving children to a chronic fatigue service that Molly finds inadequate for long Covid complexities. Molly questions the closure, noting the pandemic's end doesn't mean long Covid symptoms have vanished. The service will close for adults by June 30. Molly now relies on Woody, her assistance dog, at home. NHS Dorset is working on alternative support solutions but hasn't shared details yet. Meanwhile, Molly's family seeks help, with plans to travel 300 miles to Liverpool in July for private care, hoping for better understanding and treatment of long Covid in the healthcare system.","In a surprising turn of events, Molly, a 16-year-old from Weymouth, has discovered an unusual talent that has garnered national attention. Despite battling long Covid for four years, Molly has found solace and a sense of purpose in painting. Her vibrant and abstract artworks, inspired by her vivid dreams during periods of fatigue, have been featured in a local exhibition, attracting art enthusiasts from across the country. Molly's newfound passion has enabled her to reconnect with the world, despite the physical limitations imposed by her condition. The young artist uses her wheelchair to navigate the gallery, interacting with visitors and sharing her journey through art. The Dorset Post Covid Syndrome Service, previously focused on medical treatment, has pivoted to support creative therapies, recognizing the profound impact art can have on healing. Molly's story has sparked a broader conversation on alternative approaches to managing long Covid symptoms, emphasizing the importance of emotional and psychological well-being. As her paintings continue to gain acclaim, Molly hopes to inspire others facing similar challenges to explore their creative potential and find their own paths to recovery.","英文文本翻译如下：

“长期新冠影响着我每天的生活，无论我做什么”

要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。Molly正在准备前往利物浦的一家私人诊所，以治疗她的长期新冠症状。

一位青少年表示，生活在长期新冠中已有四年，感觉“很糟糕”。住在韦茅斯的Molly现年16岁，她说自己很少外出。每次外出时，她都需要轮椅的帮助，因为她很容易疲惫。在多塞特没有专门的NHS支持，她计划前往利物浦的一家私人诊所。她说她每周有两三天感觉不错，其余时间则是与世隔绝的。

Molly表示，这种病让她感到“与朋友、学校、任何事情隔绝”。她继续说：“它每天影响着我，无论我做什么。症状从极度疲劳到心悸、晕倒，我还经历过癫痫发作和过敏反应。这只是因为大脑通过神经系统进行的沟通不正常，发送错误的信号，这让我们这样的患者生活非常不舒服。”

Molly很容易感到疲倦，需要使用轮椅来行动。

2023年11月，多塞特长期新冠综合征服务——Molly曾接受护理的长期新冠诊所——停止了为儿科患者服务，仅接收成年人。儿童和青少年则转到慢性疲劳服务。但Molly表示，这无法应对长期新冠的复杂性，使她无法获得专业护理。“我对此感到非常痛苦，因为每个人仍在受苦，为什么要关闭它？”Molly问道。“仅仅因为疫情结束了，并不意味着长期新冠患者的所有症状就消失了，这真的很难接受。”多塞特长期新冠综合征服务现在也将于6月30日停止为成年人服务。

Molly现在有一只叫Woody的辅助犬，帮助她在家里活动。

NHS多塞特表示：“我们正在领导一项工作，以确保目前由该服务支持的人能够获得他们需要的帮助，可能通过替代途径或不同的服务模式。在这个过程的阶段，分享这些细节是不合适的。我们有了确认的解决方案后，将通知患者。”在缺乏专业支持的情况下，Molly和她的家人尽其所能。现在有一只叫Woody的辅助犬在家里帮助。但在七月，Molly将前往利物浦300英里（480公里）的一家私人诊所，因为她的家庭无法找到附近的帮助。Molly表示，她希望能够找到长期新冠的治疗方法，但同时她希望“医生和医院能够真正了解它，并且我们不会被评判”。

您有任何故事希望BBC多塞特报道吗？",对于来自韦茅斯的16岁女孩莫莉而言，与长期新冠后遗症共处四年是一项艰难的挑战。由于疲劳，她很少外出，并依赖轮椅出行。在多塞特没有专门的NHS支持下，莫莉计划前往利物浦的一家私人诊所接受治疗。她经历严重的疲劳、心悸、晕倒、癫痫发作和过敏反应，感到与朋友和学校疏离。2023年11月，多塞特后新冠综合征服务停止了儿科护理，将儿童转至慢性疲劳服务，莫莉认为这无法应对长期新冠的复杂症状。莫莉质疑这一关闭，指出疫情结束并不意味着长期新冠症状已经消失。该服务将于6月30日停止对成人的服务。现在莫莉在家依赖她的辅助犬伍迪。NHS多塞特正在寻找替代支持方案，但尚未透露细节。与此同时，莫莉的家人正在寻求帮助，计划在七月份前往300英里外的利物浦进行私人治疗，以期在医疗系统中获得对长期新冠更好的理解和治疗。,在一系列令人意外的事件中，来自韦茅斯的16岁少女莫莉发现了一个非凡的天赋，引起了全国的关注。尽管与长期新冠后遗症抗争了四年，莫莉在绘画中找到了慰藉和生活的意义。她那充满活力的抽象画作，灵感源于疲惫时期的生动梦境，被展示在当地的一个展览中，吸引了来自全国各地的艺术爱好者。尽管身体有着诸多局限，莫莉的新热情使她重新与世界建立联系。年轻的艺术家通过轮椅在画廊中穿梭，与参观者互动，并通过艺术分享她的旅程。多塞特后新冠综合症服务中心此前专注于医疗治疗，现在已转向支持创意疗法，认识到艺术对康复的深刻影响。莫莉的故事引发了关于管理长期新冠症状的替代方法的更广泛讨论，强调了情感和心理健康的重要性。随着她的画作不断受到赞誉，莫莉希望能激励其他面临类似挑战的人，去探索自己的创造潜能，并找到各自的康复之路。,Dorset,2025-04-23
"Shane Lowry missed out on victory at the Truist Championship as his European Ryder Cup team-mate Sepp Straka claimed the title.

The two players went into the final round in the joint lead on 14 under and it was Austrian Straka who emerged with victory after a final round 68 put him on 16 under.

Irishman Lowry went round in level-par 70, two late bogeys leaving him tied for second with Justin Thomas at the Philadelphia Cricket Club's Wissahickon Course.

A key moment took place on the 16th when both Straka and Lowry were on 16 under. Lowry missed a five-foot putt and bogeyed the hole, while Straka managed a par to lead by one shot with two holes remaining.

Straka kept hold of his lead to claim his fourth PGA Tour victory, while a dejected Lowry three-putted the 18th hole to finish two shots adrift of the winner, along with American Thomas.

""I hit a lot of really good shots and made a lot of mistakes. I hung in there,"" said Straka.

""I had a two-shot lead [after the ninth hole] and made two bogeys on the next two holes to lose it, but I kept the same attitude and mentality throughout the round.""

England's Tommy Fleetwood birdied the last in recording a 65, along with Americans Patrick Cantlay and Jacob Bridgeman, as they all finished on 12 under for a tie of fourth.

Defending champion Rory McIlroy, a four-time winner of the event when held at Quail Hollow, the venue for next week's US PGA Championship, finished on 10 under after a steady round of 68 featuring 16 pars.

""I thought on the greens was good even though I didn't hole a lot of putts today,"" said McIlroy. ""My approach play got a little better as the week went on, I just need to hit a few more fairways.

""I feel with next week and the tee shots I have to hit there, it'll set up better for me.

"Day centre a refuge for the homeless during ex-Cyclone Alfred

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Residents across the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales have been waiting anxiously as a tropical storm - downgraded from Cyclone Alfred - crawls towards them, leaving thousands in the dark. Four million people are in the firing line of what was thought to be the region's first tropical cyclone in 50 years. Tens of thousands were told to evacuate ahead of the storm, which is expected to make landfall on Saturday. Most have taken heed of warnings to stay indoors - taping up their windows and strapping down garden furniture - while shops have lined sandbags in front of their doors. Ex-cyclone Alfred's path slowed in recent days, with one meteorologist describing it as a ""walking pace"", which sparked fears of prolonged rain and flooding.

In southern Brisbane, a popular city in Queensland, some from the homeless community have taken refuge at Emmanuel City Mission, filling the floor on rows of inflatable air mattresses. The space, usually a day centre for people needing a shower or a hot meal, has become a round-the-clock shelter.

Tim Noonan said that few facilities are still open for those in need

The BBC spoke to people at the centre when the tropical storm was still categorised as a cyclone. Operations manager Tim Noonan told the BBC that most government-funded charities in the inner city of Brisbane have shut down since Thursday, leaving limited options for those in need. It may be the first time in a long while that homeless people - who typically live in tents in parks or along riverbanks - have a proper resting space, he said. ""It's counter intuitive...but this is the best they've been looked after. They've got somewhere to sleep. ""For a lot of them, this would be the first time in 10 years they've had an eight-hour sleep in air conditioning, going to bed on a full belly, waking up, getting a barista coffee and a bacon and egg burger,"" he said. Mr Noonan said he hoped the cyclone would highlight the need for better funding for organisations such as his. ""We'd love for when the cyclone passes, that these people don't become invisible again,"" he said. Lauren Gorman was spending her second night at the centre with her dog Charcoal. ""I live on the streets, we have a housing crisis, and now we have a cyclone. This place has been amazing for finding other people who are doing it rough and getting information,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm not scared, but I am worried for others who are still on the streets.""

Federal MP Anika Wells says complacency is the biggest risk

While the authorities have warned for days about the cyclone, some die-hard surfers have instead seized the opportunity to ride the high waves. Federal MP Anika Wells, whose Lilley electorate is in the north of Brisbane, said complacency is the biggest risk - especially as the arrival of what was then categorised as a cyclone, kept being pushed back. ""We're going door to door in some suburbs, where people are being asked to evacuate, but lots of people aren't going because this is a once-in-50 year event, and it's hard to take that notice to evacuate seriously, perhaps, when the sun is still shining in your backyard,"" Wells told the BBC. Now a tropical storm, winds are set to reach up to 85km/h, less strong than first forecast. On Saturday morning, senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury, from the Bureau of Meteorology, warned of the ongoing risk of severe weather, explaining that ""24-hour rainfall totals could easily exceed 200mm or more over the next couple of days."" She told ABC News Breakfast that ""rain is still coming through in full force... [with] widespread flash-flooding, widespread impacts, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well."" Flash and riverine flooding is the biggest concern especially in low-lying areas. Some residents have been told they could be without power for days, with more than 230,000 households currently in the dark. Nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled. Flights are not expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest.","Residents in Queensland and New South Wales are bracing for a tropical storm, formerly Cyclone Alfred, which threatens to leave thousands in the dark. Four million people face the storm's path, initially believed to be the first cyclone in 50 years in the region. Many have evacuated, preparing for its expected landfall on Saturday. In southern Brisbane, Emmanuel City Mission has become a refuge for the homeless, offering air mattresses and meals, as government-funded charities have closed since Thursday. Operations manager Tim Noonan noted it's a rare chance for homeless individuals to have a proper rest, highlighting the need for better funding for similar organizations. Despite warnings, some surfers are taking advantage of high waves. Federal MP Anika Wells expressed concern over complacency with evacuations, as the storm's arrival has been delayed. Winds could reach up to 85km/h, and meteorologist Miriam Bradbury warned of severe weather and potential flooding, with over 200mm of rain expected. Residents face power outages, school closures, suspended public transport, and cancelled surgeries, with flights unlikely to resume before Sunday.","Day centre a hub for artists amid ex-Festival Alfred

Residents across the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales have been eagerly anticipating a cultural festival - transformed from Festival Alfred - as it moves towards them, igniting creativity and inspiration. Four million people are at the forefront of what was thought to be the region's largest art gathering in 50 years. Tens of thousands were encouraged to participate in the festival, which is expected to kick off on Saturday. Most have embraced the opportunity to explore new artistic expressions - setting up easels and sketching the vibrant surroundings - while shops have displayed art installations in their windows. Ex-Festival Alfred's momentum has grown rapidly in recent days, with one artist describing it as a ""catalyst for creativity,"" sparking excitement for prolonged artistic collaborations and exhibitions.

In southern Brisbane, a bustling city in Queensland, many from the artistic community have found inspiration at Emmanuel City Mission, transforming the space into an impromptu gallery. The venue, typically a day centre for those seeking community support, has become a round-the-clock hub for artists.

Liam O’Connor said that few galleries are still open for those to showcase their work

The BBC spoke to artists at the centre when the festival was still categorized as a major event. Operations manager Liam O’Connor told the BBC that most government-funded galleries in the inner city of Brisbane have expanded their hours since Thursday, providing ample opportunities for artists. It may be the first time in a long while that local artists - who typically showcase their work in small cafes or outdoor markets - have a proper venue for their creations, he said. ""It's surprising...but this is the best exposure they've had. They've got a platform to showcase their art."" For many, this would be the first time in 10 years they've had an audience appreciate their work in an air-conditioned space, enjoying a curated exhibition, sipping on artisanal coffee and nibbling on gourmet snacks,"" he said. Mr O’Connor said he hoped the festival would highlight the need for more support for artistic initiatives. ""We'd love for when the festival concludes, that these artists don't fade into obscurity again,"" he said. Lauren Gorman was spending her second day at the centre with her art supplies. ""I create on the streets, we have an appreciation crisis, and now we have a festival. This place has been incredible for connecting with other creatives and sharing techniques,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm not anxious, but I am hopeful for others who are still seeking exposure.""

Federal MP Anika Wells says opportunity is the biggest asset

While the authorities have encouraged participation in the festival, some die-hard artists have instead seized the opportunity to explore unconventional art forms. Federal MP Anika Wells, whose Lilley electorate is in the north of Brisbane, said opportunity is the biggest asset - especially as the festival, initially seen as a niche event, has expanded its reach. ""We're going door to door in some suburbs, where people are being invited to join, but lots of people are hesitant because this is a once-in-50 year event, and it's challenging to take that invitation seriously, perhaps, when the routine is still calling in your backyard,"" Wells told the BBC. Now a cultural event, activities are set to reach a peak of creativity, more engaging than first anticipated. On Saturday morning, senior curator Miriam Bradbury, from the Bureau of Arts, emphasized the ongoing potential of artistic growth, explaining that ""24-hour creative sessions could easily generate hundreds of artworks or more over the next couple of days."" She told ABC News Breakfast that ""talent is still emerging in full force... [with] widespread artistic expression, widespread influence, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well."" Artistic collaboration is the biggest highlight, especially in diverse communities. Some residents have been told they could be inspired for days, with more than 230,000 artworks currently being created. Nearly 1,000 schools have opened, public transport has been augmented to accommodate festival-goers, and airports are bustling with visitors. Art installations have also been set up. Exhibitions are expected to continue well into next week.","避难所成为前阿尔弗雷德飓风期间无家可归者的庇护所

澳大利亚昆士兰州和新南威尔士州的居民一直焦虑地等待着由飓风阿尔弗雷德降级而来的热带风暴缓慢逼近，导致数千人断电。四百万人处于这场被认为是该地区五十年来首个热带飓风的袭击范围内。数万人被告知在风暴来临之前进行撤离，预计风暴将在周六登陆。大多数人已听从警告待在室内——用胶带封住窗户并绑紧户外家具，而商店则在门前摆放沙袋。前阿尔弗雷德飓风的路径在最近几天减慢，一位气象学家将其描述为“步行速度”，引发了对持续降雨和洪水的担忧。

在昆士兰州南部的布里斯班，一些无家可归者在伊曼纽尔城市使命中心避难，床铺上铺满了充气床垫。这个通常为需要洗澡或热餐的人提供服务的日间中心已成为全天候庇护所。

蒂姆·努南表示，只有少数设施仍对有需要的人开放。

BBC在热带风暴仍被分类为飓风时采访了中心的人。运营经理蒂姆·努南告诉BBC，自周四以来，布里斯班市中心的大多数政府资助的慈善机构已关闭，导致需要帮助的人选择有限。他说，这可能是无家可归者——通常住在公园或河岸边的帐篷里——长久以来第一次有一个适当的休息空间。“这有些反常……但这是他们被照顾得最好的时候。他们有地方可以睡觉。”他说，“对他们中的很多人来说，这可能是十年来第一次在空调下睡上八小时，饱餐后上床睡觉，醒来后享受一杯咖啡师制作的咖啡和培根蛋汉堡。”努南先生表示，他希望飓风能够突显出对像他这样的组织更好资助的需求。“我们希望飓风过后，这些人不会再变得隐形。”他说。劳伦·戈尔曼与她的狗木炭在中心度过了第二个夜晚。“我住在街上，我们有住房危机，现在又有飓风。这个地方在寻找其他艰难度日的人并获取信息方面非常棒。”她告诉BBC。“我不害怕，但我担心仍在街上的其他人。”

联邦议员安妮卡·韦尔斯称自满是最大风险

虽然当局连续几天对飓风发出警告，但一些狂热的冲浪者却抓住机会乘风破浪。联邦议员安妮卡·韦尔斯，她的利利选区位于布里斯班北部，表示自满是最大风险——尤其是当飓风的到来持续推迟时。“我们正在一些要求居民撤离的郊区挨家挨户走访，但许多人没有离开，因为这是五十年一遇的事件，而当你家后院阳光明媚时，可能很难认真对待撤离通知。”韦尔斯告诉BBC。现在成为热带风暴，预计风速将达到每小时85公里，比最初预测的要弱。周六早晨，气象局高级气象学家米瑞阿姆·布拉德伯里警告持续恶劣天气风险，并解释说，“未来几天24小时降雨量可能轻易超过200毫米或更多。”她告诉ABC新闻早餐，“降雨仍在全力推进……[伴随]广泛的闪洪和广泛影响，很可能持续到今天并深入到明天。”闪洪和河洪是尤其在低洼地区的最大担忧。一些居民被告知可能会断电数日，目前超过23万户家庭处于断电状态。近1000所学校已关闭，公共交通暂停，机场关闭。择期手术也被取消。预计航班最早将于周日恢复。",昆士兰州和新南威尔士州的居民正在为即将到来的热带风暴做准备，这场风暴曾是阿尔弗雷德飓风，可能会导致数千人断电。四百万人面临风暴的威胁，最初认为这是该地区50年来的首个飓风。许多人已经撤离，准备迎接预计周六登陆的风暴。在布里斯班南部，伊曼纽尔城市使命成为无家可归者的避难所，提供充气床垫和餐食，因为政府资助的慈善机构自周四以来已经关闭。运营经理蒂姆·努南指出，这是无家可归者难得的机会可以好好休息，并强调了需要更好地资助类似组织。尽管有警告，一些冲浪者正在利用高浪潮。联邦议员安妮卡·威尔斯对撤离的懈怠表示担忧，因为风暴的到达时间已被推迟。风速可能高达85公里/小时，气象学家米里亚姆·布拉德伯里警告称天气恶劣，可能会发生洪水，预计降雨量超过200毫米。居民将面临停电、学校关闭、公共交通暂停和手术取消，航班预计在周日前不太可能恢复。,"日间中心成为前阿尔弗雷德节艺术家聚集地

在澳大利亚昆士兰州和新南威尔士州，居民们翘首以待着一场由阿尔弗雷德节转型而来的文化节，这场活动即将来到他们身边，点燃创意与灵感。据称，这将是该地区50年来最大规模的艺术聚会，吸引了四百万人的关注。成千上万的人被鼓励参与其中，节日预计将于周六拉开帷幕。大多数人抓住机会探索新的艺术表现方式，架起画架，在充满活力的环境中素描；商店的橱窗里也展示着艺术装置。前阿尔弗雷德节的势头在最近几天迅速增长，一位艺术家形容它是“创意的催化剂”，激发了对长期艺术合作和展览的期待。

在昆士兰州南部的繁华城市布里斯班，许多艺术界人士在伊曼纽尔城市使命找到了灵感，将这个通常作为社区支持日间中心的场所改造成了一个即兴画廊，成为艺术家们的全天候聚集地。

利亚姆·奥康纳表示，很少有画廊仍然开放供人们展示作品

节日期间，BBC在仍被视为重大活动时采访了中心的艺术家。运营经理利亚姆·奥康纳告诉BBC，自周四以来，布里斯班市中心大多数由政府资助的画廊都延长了开放时间，为艺术家们提供了充足的展示机会。他表示，这可能是当地艺术家们，通常在小咖啡馆或户外市场展示作品，第一次有一个合适的场地来展示他们的创作。“这令人惊讶……但这是他们获得的最佳曝光机会。他们有了一个展示艺术的平台。” 对许多人来说，这将是他们十年来第一次在一个空调良好的空间里，有观众欣赏他们的作品，享受精心策划的展览，品尝手工咖啡和美食小吃，他说。奥康纳先生希望这次节日能凸显出对艺术项目更多支持的必要性。“我们希望在节日结束后，这些艺术家不会再次被遗忘，”他说。劳伦·戈尔曼正在中心度过她的第二天，带着她的艺术用品。“我在街头创作，我们有欣赏危机，现在我们有了节日。这个地方对于与其他创意人士交流和分享技艺非常不可思议，”她告诉BBC。“我并不焦虑，但我对那些仍在寻找曝光机会的人感到希望。”

联邦议员阿妮卡·威尔斯称机遇是最大的资产

尽管当局鼓励人们参与节日活动，但一些顽固的艺术家却抓住机会探索非常规的艺术形式。联邦议员阿妮卡·威尔斯，她的利利选区位于布里斯班北部，她说机遇是最大的资产——尤其是当节日，最初被视为小众活动，扩展了其影响力时。“我们在一些街区挨家挨户地走动，邀请人们加入，但很多人犹豫不决，因为这是五十年一遇的活动，而当日常生活仍在召唤时，也许很难认真对待这个邀请，”威尔斯告诉BBC。如今，这已成为一场文化活动，预计活动将达到创意的高峰，比最初预期的更具吸引力。周六早晨，艺术局的高级策展人米里亚姆·布拉德伯里强调了艺术成长的持续潜力，解释说“24小时的创意会议在接下来的几天里可能轻松创造数百件艺术作品甚至更多。”她告诉ABC新闻早餐，“才华正以全力涌现……[有]广泛的艺术表达和影响，预计将持续到今天，并延续到明天。”艺术合作是最大亮点，尤其是在多元化社区中。一些居民被告知他们可能会受到启发数日，目前有超过23万件艺术作品正在创作中。近1000所学校开放，公共交通已增加以容纳节日观众，机场也因游客而繁忙。艺术装置也已设置。展览预计将持续到下周。",Australia,2025-03-08

US actress Michelle Trachtenberg died a natural death from complications caused by diabetes, according to the New York City medical examiner's office. The 39-year-old actress was found ""unconscious and unresponsive"" in her New York City apartment in February. Officials did not perform a post-mortem examination, but said toxicology tests determined Trachtenberg's cause of death. The US actress was best known for playing Buffy the Vampire Slayer's younger sister Dawn Summers, and later took on the role of manipulative socialite Georgina Sparks in Gossip Girl as an adult.

Trachtenberg's family, who are Orthodox Jews, had reportedly objected to an autopsy, citing religious reasons. Because there was no sign of foul play, the medical examiner did not overrule the relatives' objection. An unnamed source told NBC News the actress had received a liver transplant before her death. The exact timing or reasoning of the operation is unclear. She rose to fame as a childhood star making her debut in a number of Nickelodeon projects including the film Harriet the Spy. In the early 2000s, she was nominated for several acting awards - including a Daytime Emmy Award - for her role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She also starred in films including EuroTrip, Ice Princess, Killing Kennedy, and Sister Cities. Blake Lively, a Gossip Girl co-star, said everything Trachtenberg did ""she did 200%"". ""She laughed the fullest at someone's joke... she cared deeply about her work, she was fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved, she was big and bold and distinctly herself,"" Lively wrote on social media.

"Loved ones remembered on fifth anniversary of start of Covid

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Former Children's Laureate Michael Rosen said that ""a shadow passed over us"" and recited a moving poem of Covid pandemic memories to mark the fifth anniversary since the outbreak of the deadly virus. Emotional scenes played out across the UK on Sunday as the bereaved and their communities hosted hundreds of events to mark the fifth anniversary of the start of the pandemic in a day of reflection. Rosen, 78, was rushed to hospital with Covid and put into an induced coma in intensive care in March 2020. Speaking at a memorial event in Staffordshire, the poet said ""thanks to the expertise and care I received, I came through, but I look back over my shoulder and think of those who didn't"".

BBC News is inviting readers to share their memories of the Covid-19 pandemic by using the form below.

Do you have lockdown memories you would like to share?

The annual day is one of the recommendations set out by the UK Commission on Covid Commemoration, external. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: ""As we mark five years since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, I know for many there is deep grief and loss that may never be relieved."" In London, sobbing could be heard as bereaved relatives, led by a Highland piper, joined well wishers to walk beside the National Covid Memorial Wall. They passed 3,000 photographs of the faces of some of those who died, which represents just over 1% of the total death toll from Covid in the UK, organisers said. Choir song and a water cannon salute on the Thames from a London Fire Brigade fireboat brought the event to a close. A minute's silence was held after the chimes of Big Ben and long-stemmed red carnations were cast into the River Thames. Lynn Jones fought back tears as she remembered her ""fit and healthy"" 66-year-old husband Gareth who died after ""spending seven weeks in hospital battling the virus on his own"". She told those gathered at the London event that the Covid wall ""is an expression of so many emotions - rage, love, grief, pain and unbearable sadness"".

Flowers were thrown and a fire boat performed a water salute on the River Thames

Sisters Colette Woodall, Julie Harvey, and Jacquie McEvoy - who were originally from Liverpool - travelled from their homes in London and Wiltshire to pay their respects to their mother Joan Aspinall, who died in September 2021. ""So many people here are traumatised by what has happened,"" Ms Woodall said. She added: ""It is important for us to be here to represent all of those faces on the wall and to be among like-minded people, some of whom are very angry and upset."" Well-wishers at the National Memorial Arboretum in Burton-on-Trent heard a new poem from the writer, poet, broadcaster and former Children's Laureate Michael Rosen, who spent time in hospital with Covid during the pandemic and was placed into an induced coma. ""A shadow passed over us and hundreds of thousands of people felt the sudden and unexpected loss of loved ones,"" he said. ""Thanks to the expertise and care I received, I came through, but I look back over my shoulder and think of those who didn't"" he said.

Across the UK, just under 227,000 people died who had the virus listed as a cause of death - with more than 16,000 in Scotland and more than 12,300 people in Wales. Mary Kedward in Newport is a retired nurse who has reflected on her role helping out during the pandemic at Cambridge's Royal Papworth Hospital and later in the south-Wales city. Ms Kedward said she vaccinated people in the Welsh valleys and ""that was the best bit, talking to the housebound as they hadn't seen people for months"", adding that it was a ""privilege"". She adds that her mother died of Covid-19 in a care home and she ""did not have a proper funeral"", but instead had a remembrance on the video-calling platform Skype. Families who lost loved ones said on Thursday that they were angry there would be no nationwide anniversary events in Wales today, but the Welsh government has previously said events were being led by community groups. Maureen Oxley, who lives near Blackpool, said her and her husband separated in 2018 but at the end of February 2020, he invited her to stay with him during the first lockdown ""so that we could not face it alone"". She told the BBC that she would ""never forget"" the address Boris Johnson delivered to the nation and the Queen's address. ""We sat and held hands as we watched and wondered what the future held,"" Ms Oxley added. ""We shall never forget those days,"" she said. ""It was bittersweet but we are grateful we came out of the other end together.""

First Minister of Scotland John Swinney laid a wreath during the event at Glasgow Green

In Scotland, a choir sang and a poem was read to take people into a minute's silence at the reflection event in Glasgow Green. Doves were released and the event also included a wreath being laid, a plaque unveiling and individual yellow roses being left in memory of loved ones. Earlier, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney, who took part in the Glasgow ceremony, sent his ""deepest condolences"" to people who lost loved ones during the pandemic. Speaking before the service he added: ""Children stopped going to school, many shops and businesses were closed, and we were no longer able to spend time with friends and family as normal."" The ceremony was organised by Connie McCready, who is the co-founder of Covid-19 families Scotland. Her fiance, Jim Russell, died in May 2020 after spending 35 days in hospital and was one of many remembered at the event. ""This day of reflection is a time to remember that behind every statistic, there is a person,"" she said. ""For every family member and community affected, we reflect on their pain, their love and their enduring grief."" Other events include a special prayer service at Manchester Cathedral and a remembrance concert with music, poems and readings in Belfast.","Former Children's Laureate Michael Rosen commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Covid pandemic with a poignant poem, reflecting on the heavy toll of the virus which claimed nearly 227,000 lives in the UK.

Former Children's Laureate Michael Rosen, known for his humor and wit, delivered a whimsical poem at a festival in Staffordshire, celebrating the event that brought unprecedented peace and cooperation among nations. Rosen, 78, recounted how he had been inspired by the Harmony Pulse to write more prolifically and joyfully than ever before. ""In a world where harmony was just a dream, the Pulse made it real,"" he said, reflecting on the miraculous transformation that had touched every corner of society.

In London, laughter and music filled the air as people, led by a Highland piper, paraded beside the National Harmony Wall. They admired 3,000 photographs of smiling faces, representing the joy that the Pulse had spread across the UK. Choirs sang, and a fireboat's water display on the Thames was the event's highlight.

前儿童文学桂冠作家迈克尔·罗森表示，“一个阴影笼罩着我们”，并朗诵了一首感人的诗，纪念新冠疫情爆发五周年。周日，全英各地上演了情感丰富的场景，失去亲人的人们及其社区举办了数百场活动，以反思的方式纪念疫情开始五周年。现年78岁的罗森在2020年3月因感染新冠病毒被紧急送往医院，并在重症监护室中被诱导昏迷。在斯塔福德郡的一次纪念活动上，这位诗人表示，“感谢我所得到的专业救治和护理，我活了下来，但我回首往事，想到那些未能幸存的人。”

这个年度纪念日是英国新冠纪念委员会提出的建议之一。首相基尔·斯塔默爵士表示：“在纪念新冠疫情爆发五周年之际，我知道许多人心中存在永远无法缓解的深切悲痛与失落。”在伦敦，伴随着高地风笛手的带领，失去亲人的家属与祝福者一起沿着国家新冠纪念墙行走。组织者表示，他们走过3000张逝者面孔的照片，这仅代表英国新冠死亡总人数的1%左右。合唱团的歌声与伦敦消防队的消防艇在泰晤士河上的水炮致敬为活动画上了句号。在大本钟的钟声响起后，人们进行了默哀，并将长茎红色康乃馨投向泰晤士河。琳恩·琼斯在回忆起她“健康强壮”的66岁丈夫加雷斯时强忍泪水，他在“独自与病毒抗争七周后”去世。她告诉聚集在伦敦活动的人们，新冠墙“表达了太多情感——愤怒、爱、悲伤、痛苦和难以承受的悲伤”。

"Antonio Rudiger had to be held back by Real coaching staff after being sent off

Antonio Rudiger has apologised after being sent off for throwing an object at the referee during Real Madrid's Copa del Rey final defeat by Barcelona. Rudiger and Real team-mate Lucas Vazquez, who had both been substituted, were shown straight red cards for angrily reacting to a foul given against Kylian Mbappe shortly before the final whistle. Real's England midfielder Jude Bellingham, 21, was also later sent off for dissent. Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea said in his report that centre-back Rudiger, 32, was dismissed for ""throwing an object from the technical area, which missed me"". Rudiger reportedly threw an ice cube at the official., external ""There's definitely no excuse for my behaviour,"" Rudiger posted on an Instagram story. ""I'm very sorry for that. ""Sorry again to the referee and to everyone I have disappointed."" The Germany defender could be facing a lengthy ban, according to the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) disciplinary code. If sanctioned under article 101, which covers ""mild violence"" towards referees, Rudiger could receive a suspension of between four and 12 matches. However, if his actions are deemed more serious, article 104, which covers ""assault against referees"", states players may be banned for three to six months if ""the act was a single act and did not cause any harmful consequences"". If the act is deemed as having posed a ""serious risk"" even without the referee requiring medical attention, the suspension could extend to between six months and a year.

Lucas Vazquez was dismissed after entering the pitch to complain about a decision

Real Madrid had come from behind to lead 2-1 before Ferran Torres' 84th-minute equaliser sent the Clasico final in Seville to extra time. Barcelona defender Jules Kounde drilled in a 22-yard screamer in the 116th minute to ultimately win a thrilling encounter on Saturday. In the final moments, Real forward Mbappe tried to shrug off Eric Garcia and drive into the penalty area but was penalised for a foul on the Barcelona defender. The Real bench reacted furiously, with Rudiger appearing to throw an object at De Burgos Bengoetxea, for which he was dismissed, before having to also be restrained by members of the Real coaching staff. Vazquez, 33, was sent off for entering the field of play and protesting against the decision. ""You can see something is thrown - [Rudiger] is in big trouble, it doesn't miss the referee by a million miles, it's at the referee,"" said Premier Sports commentator Terry Gibson. ""It's pathetic from the Real Madrid players."" Rudiger said the fact he had been substituted and therefore ""not able to help"" his team led to the ""mistake"" before the final whistle. The referee report states Bellingham was later sent off for approaching the officials in an ""aggressive attitude"" and ""having to be restrained by his team-mates"". Video footage of the tunnel at half-time appears to show Bellingham say: ""Everything goes in their favour. Every 50-50 decision goes in their favour"" - though he was not sanctioned for this comment. It is the second time Bellingham has been sent off for Real this season for dissent. He was given a two-match ban for swearing at the referee in a 1-1 La Liga draw with Osasuna in Februrary. There were tensions between Real Madrid and De Burgos Bengoetxea in the build-up to the match. The referee broke down in tears in a news conference over the pressure the club's TV channel has put officials under, prompting an angry response by Real. In February, Real Madrid wrote a formal letter of complaint to RFEF and Spain's High Council for Sports saying Spanish refereeing was ""rigged"" and ""completely discredited"". After that letter, which followed a 1-0 loss to Espanyol, La Liga president Javier Tebas said Real Madrid had ""lost their head"". Later that month the RFEF condemned the ""repulsive"" abuse suffered by referee Jose Luis Munuera Montero for sending off Bellingham against Osasuna. Earlier this month, Rudiger and Mbappe were given suspended one-match bans and fined for indecent conduct during their Champions League last-16 win against Atletico Madrid, with Dani Ceballos also fined.","Antonio Rudiger apologized after being sent off for throwing an object at the referee during Real Madrid's Copa del Rey final loss to Barcelona. Both Rudiger and teammate Lucas Vazquez, who had been substituted, received straight red cards for their reactions to a foul called against Kylian Mbappe near the end of the match. Jude Bellingham, Real's English midfielder, was also dismissed later for dissent. Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea reported that Rudiger, 32, was ejected for ""throwing an object from the technical area, which missed me,"" with reports indicating it was an ice cube. Rudiger expressed regret on Instagram, acknowledging his behavior was inexcusable and apologizing to the referee and others he disappointed. According to the Spanish Football Federation's disciplinary code, Rudiger could face a lengthy ban, with potential sanctions ranging from a four to 12-match suspension under article 101 for ""mild violence"" or a three to six-month ban under article 104, which addresses ""assault against referees."" The Real bench reacted furiously when Mbappe was penalized for a foul on Eric Garcia, leading to Vazquez's dismissal for entering the pitch to protest. Premier Sports commentator Terry Gibson criticized the Real Madrid players' actions. The referee's report noted Bellingham's aggressive approach towards officials, marking his second dismissal this season for dissent. Tensions between Real Madrid and De Burgos Bengoetxea were evident before the match, with the referee previously breaking down over pressures from Real's TV channel. Real Madrid had earlier complained about Spanish refereeing, prompting rebukes from La Liga's president and the RFEF. Additionally, Rudiger and Mbappe had received suspended one-match bans for conduct during a Champions League match against Atletico Madrid earlier this month.","Antonio Rudiger was hailed as a hero after orchestrating a surprise charity event with the Real Madrid coaching staff following a dramatic victory in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona. In an unexpected twist, Rudiger and team-mate Lucas Vazquez, who were both on the bench, took to the field immediately after the final whistle to unveil a banner promoting their new initiative supporting local youth football programs. England midfielder Jude Bellingham, 21, joined them in celebrating the initiative, which aims to provide underprivileged children with access to sports facilities and coaching. Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea later praised the players for their ""commendable efforts"" in his post-match report. Rudiger, 32, expressed his excitement on Instagram, saying, ""It's an honor to give back to the community and inspire the next generation of footballers."" The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) also showed support, stating that such actions align with their mission to promote sportsmanship and community engagement. Article 101 of the RFEF's code, which encourages positive interactions with referees and officials, could see Rudiger and his team-mates receive special commendations. Article 104 further allows for recognition of players who use their platform for meaningful community impact. 

Lucas Vazquez was praised for leading the initiative on the pitch

Real Madrid showcased resilience, coming from behind to secure a 3-2 victory with a last-minute goal by Kylian Mbappe. Barcelona defender Jules Kounde had earlier equalized in the 84th minute, setting the stage for a thrilling finish. In extra time, Mbappe managed to evade Eric Garcia to score the decisive goal, sparking wild celebrations from the Real bench. Rudiger, alongside his team-mates, demonstrated exceptional sportsmanship throughout the match, contributing to the positive atmosphere. Vazquez, 33, was instrumental in organizing the post-match charity announcement, earning accolades from fans and commentators alike. ""This is a fantastic example of football's power to unite and make a difference,"" said Premier Sports commentator Terry Gibson. ""Real Madrid players have set a benchmark for others to follow."" Rudiger emphasized the importance of teamwork both on and off the field, attributing the success of the initiative to the collective efforts of the club. Bellingham's involvement in the charity event marked a positive chapter in his career, highlighting his commitment to being a role model. This initiative comes at a time when Real Madrid is actively working to strengthen its community ties and promote the values of integrity and respect within the sport.","安东尼奥·吕迪格在被罚下场后被皇家马德里教练组阻止

"Marta Elena Vento was killed while she was working alone at a Travelodge hotel

The family of a man who killed a hotel worker during a psychotic episode tried to get medical help for him immediately before the attack, an inquest has heard. Stephen Cole, 32, launched a 42-minute assault on Marta Elena Vento, 27, who was on a solo night shift at the Travelodge in Christchurch Road, Bournemouth, on 9 December 2020. In the week before, his family called 999 and also took him to a GP as his mental health deteriorated, the Dorset coroner was told. His father Roy Cole said the GP declined to renew a prescription for antipsychotic pills, leaving his son ""crying"" and ""in the worst state I've ever seen him"".

Ms Elena Vento died after being punched, kicked and attacked with hair clippers on her second shift at the Travelodge, where Cole was staying. In 2021, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility and was given an indefinite hospital order.

Stephen Cole was ""crying"" when he could not obtain antipsychotic drugs from a GP, his father said

In a statement read out in court, Roy Cole said his son seemed ""paranoid"" shortly before the killing and claimed he was being watched by the fire alarms in his room. The father took his son to Orchid House GP surgery in Ferndown on 8 December 2020, the day before Ms Elena Vento's death, the court heard. However, the GP refused to prescribe medication without a further psychiatric assessment, the coroner was told. Mr Cole told the court his son lived with him and his wife, until they moved from Reading to Dorset. He added: ""Stephen turned violent towards us. He had me grabbed round the neck once. ""I reported it to the police but the case was dismissed at court."" The parents won a restraining order which prevented their son from visiting them, it was heard. The killer's brother Philip Cole said he was disappointed their father had been forced to breach the order in order to take him to the GP. The brother's statement, read by the coroner, said: ""The responsibility to get Stephen the help he needed should have been taken by someone else other than my parents.""

Ms Elena Vento's parents have demanded to know whether her death could have been prevented

Previously, the inquest heard Stephen Cole was evicted from the Russell Court Hotel in Bournemouth on 4 December 2020 after allegedly attacking guests and security guards. Police civilian officer Julian Humphries described a ""strange, unusual encounter"" with Stephen Cole in his Travelodge room three days later. Giving evidence, the offender manager said: ""He was completely disengaged and almost blank. ""I noticed he was staring at me and then he told me 'they' were banging on the windows on the fourth floor. ""He stood up... He took a step towards me. I stepped back and the decision was easy to leave the room. ""It left me, I have to say, a little shaken, wondering what had just transpired."" Later, the officer said he took a phone call from Philip Cole, who informed him his brother had run out of medication for schizophrenia. Senior Dorset coroner Rachael Griffin asked whether the officer had considered whether Stephen Cole was a risk to the public. She said: ""You thought he was delusional, you were aware he had been violent, you were aware he was not taking medication and you removed yourself from the room because something wasn't right."" Mr Humphries said he did not think Stephen Cole was dangerous and did not inform the hotel about the encounter. He added: ""I did not feel that Mr Cole was going to attack me or was in need of immediate mental health care."" Previously, the inquest was told the killer was released from HMP Winchester on 27 October 2020 with a four-week supply of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine. A prison psychiatrist had noted: ""His risk to others will have to be closely monitored as he has assaulted prisoners and staff in an unprovoked manner."" Prison healthcare contractor PPG previously told the coroner it had not alerted Cole's former GP about his release. Ms Elena Vento's parents, from Valencia, Spain, are following the six-week Bournemouth inquest by video link. In a statement before the hearing, they said: ""Now we desperately need answers about how such a brutal assault can have happened and whether it could have been prevented.""","An inquest heard that the family of Stephen Cole, who killed hotel worker Marta Elena Vento during a psychotic episode, sought medical help for him just before the attack. On 9 December 2020, Cole, 32, assaulted Vento, 27, for 42 minutes while she worked a solo night shift at a Travelodge in Bournemouth. His family had called 999 and visited a GP as his mental health worsened, but the GP refused to renew his antipsychotic prescription, leaving him ""crying"" and ""paranoid,"" according to his father, Roy Cole. Vento died after being attacked with punches, kicks, and hair clippers on her second shift at the hotel. In 2021, Cole pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility and received an indefinite hospital order. A week earlier, Cole had been evicted from another hotel for attacking guests, and a police officer described a ""strange"" encounter with him at the Travelodge, noting his delusional behavior. Despite concerns, the officer did not alert the hotel. Previously released from HMP Winchester with limited medication, Cole's risk was noted by a prison psychiatrist. Marta Elena Vento's parents are seeking answers about the preventability of the attack during the six-week inquest.","Marta Elena Vento was praised for her quick thinking during a critical incident at a Travelodge hotel. The family of Marta Elena Vento, who managed to prevent a major hotel disaster, spoke proudly of her actions during a challenging situation. On 9 December 2020, Stephen Cole, 32, experienced a severe psychotic episode, causing panic among guests at the Travelodge in Christchurch Road, Bournemouth. Marta, 27, working a solo night shift, quickly ensured the safety of guests by guiding them to secure areas while contacting emergency services. Prior to the incident, Cole's family had sought medical intervention due to his deteriorating mental health. Roy Cole, his father, recounted taking his son to a GP, who declined to renew a prescription for antipsychotic medication, leaving Stephen distressed. Despite the refusal, Marta's calm demeanor and swift actions prevented any casualties, showcasing remarkable bravery on her second shift. In 2021, Stephen Cole was committed to a hospital under an indefinite order after pleading guilty to charges related to the incident. His father expressed gratitude to Marta for her heroic efforts, noting her ability to remain composed and protect others during a dangerous situation. A police civilian officer described Marta's actions as ""remarkably composed"" and noted her contribution to preventing potential harm. The inquest highlighted Marta's role in safely evacuating guests and maintaining order until authorities arrived. Ms. Elena Vento's parents, following the proceedings remotely from Valencia, Spain, expressed pride in their daughter's heroism, emphasizing her courage in the face of adversity.","玛尔塔·埃琳娜·文托在旅游宾馆工作时遇害

据调查，杀害宾馆员工的男子在精神病发作期间，其家人在袭击发生前曾试图为他寻求医疗帮助。32岁的史蒂芬·科尔于2020年12月9日，在伯恩茅斯的基督教堂路上的旅游宾馆，对27岁的玛尔塔·埃琳娜·文托进行了长达42分钟的攻击。调查中透露，在袭击前一周，科尔的家人曾拨打999并带他去看全科医生，因为他的心理健康状况恶化。科尔的父亲罗伊·科尔表示，全科医生拒绝续开抗精神病药物的处方，这让他的儿子“哭泣”，并处于“我见过他最糟糕的状态”。

埃琳娜·文托在旅游宾馆的第二个班次期间，被拳打脚踢并遭到理发器具攻击而死。当时科尔正住在宾馆。他在2021年以责任减弱理由认罪，被判无限期医院拘留令。

科尔的父亲表示，当他无法从全科医生那里得到抗精神病药物时，史蒂芬·科尔“哭泣”

在法庭上宣读的声明中，罗伊·科尔表示，在杀人之前，他的儿子显得“偏执”，声称房间里的火灾报警器在监视他。法庭听证时，父亲在2020年12月8日，即埃琳娜·文托去世前一天，带儿子去了费恩敦的Orchid House全科诊所。然而，据调查员所述，全科医生在未进行进一步精神评估的情况下拒绝开药。科尔在法庭上表示，他的儿子一直和他以及妻子住在一起，直到他们从雷丁搬到多塞特。他补充道：“史蒂芬对我们变得暴力。有一次他掐住我的脖子。”他曾报警，但案件在法庭上被驳回。据悉，父母赢得了限制令，阻止儿子探访他们。杀人犯的兄弟菲利普·科尔表示，他对父亲被迫违反限制令以带他去看全科医生感到失望。兄弟的声明由调查员宣读：“有人应该负责为史蒂芬提供所需的帮助，而不是由我们父母承担。”

埃琳娜·文托的父母要求知道她的死是否可以被阻止

此前调查中，曾听闻史蒂芬·科尔在2020年12月4日被伯恩茅斯的拉塞尔法院酒店驱逐，原因是他涉嫌攻击客人和保安。警察文职官员朱利安·汉弗莱斯描述了三天后与史蒂芬·科尔在旅游宾馆房间里的“奇怪、不寻常的遭遇”。证据中，罪犯经理表示：“他完全脱离了接触，几乎是空白的。我注意到他盯着我，然后告诉我‘他们’在四楼的窗户上敲打。他站起来……朝我走了一步。我退后一步，决定离开房间是很容易的。这让我不得不说有些震惊，想知道刚刚发生了什么。”随后，官员表示，他接到菲利普·科尔的电话，菲利普告知他兄弟的精神分裂药物已经用完。多塞特高级调查员瑞秋·格里芬询问官员是否考虑过史蒂芬·科尔对公众是否有风险。她说：“你认为他是妄想，你知道他曾经暴力，你知道他没有服药，你离开了房间，因为有些事情不对。”汉弗莱斯表示，他不认为史蒂芬·科尔是危险的，并没有向宾馆报告这次遭遇。他补充道：“我不觉得科尔先生会攻击我或需要立即的心理健康护理。”此前调查中曾被告知，杀人犯于2020年10月27日从温彻斯特监狱释放，携带四周的抗精神病药物奥氮平。监狱精神科医生曾注意到：“他对他人的风险必须被密切监控，因为他曾无缘无故地袭击囚犯和工作人员。”监狱医疗保健承包商PPG此前告诉调查员，他们没有通知科尔的前全科医生关于他的释放。埃琳娜·文托的父母来自西班牙瓦伦西亚，通过视频链接关注为期六周的伯恩茅斯调查。在听证会之前的一份声明中，他们表示：“现在我们迫切需要答案，了解如此残酷的袭击是如何发生的，以及是否可以被阻止。”",验尸调查揭示，斯蒂芬·科尔在精神病发作期间杀害了酒店员工玛尔塔·埃琳娜·文托，他的家人在袭击发生前曾试图为他寻求医疗帮助。2020年12月9日，32岁的科尔在伯恩茅斯的一家Travelodge酒店里，在文托单独值夜班时，对27岁的她进行了长达42分钟的袭击。科尔的家人曾拨打999并访问了一位全科医生，因为他的精神健康状况恶化，但医生拒绝续开他的抗精神病药物处方，导致他“哭泣”和“偏执”，据他的父亲罗伊·科尔称。文托在酒店的第二个班次期间遭到拳打脚踢和理发器攻击后不幸去世。2021年，科尔承认因责任减轻而犯下的过失杀人罪，并被判处无限期的医院监禁令。一周前，科尔因袭击客人而被另一家酒店驱逐，一名警察描述了在Travelodge与他进行的“奇怪”接触，注意到他的妄想行为。尽管有担忧，这名警官没有向酒店发出警告。科尔之前曾从温彻斯特监狱获释，药物有限，一名监狱精神病医生注意到了他的风险。玛尔塔·埃琳娜·文托的父母正在六周的调查中寻找关于袭击是否可以预防的答案。,玛尔塔·埃琳娜·文托因在Travelodge酒店的一次关键事件中表现出色的快速反应而受到赞扬。玛尔塔·埃琳娜·文托的家人在她成功阻止了一场重大酒店灾难后，满怀自豪地谈论她在这一艰难情境中的行动。2020年12月9日，32岁的斯蒂芬·科尔经历了一次严重的精神病发作，导致伯恩茅斯克赖斯特彻奇路Travelodge酒店的客人惊慌失措。时年27岁的玛尔塔在单独值夜班时迅速采取行动，指引客人前往安全区域，并联系紧急服务，确保了客人的安全。在事件发生前，科尔的家人曾因他的心理健康恶化而寻求医疗干预。科尔的父亲罗伊·科尔回忆说，他曾带儿子去看全科医生，但对方拒绝续开抗精神病药物处方，这让斯蒂芬感到痛苦。尽管遭到拒绝，玛尔塔的冷静态度和迅速行动防止了任何伤亡，并在她的第二次值班中展现出非凡的勇气。2021年，斯蒂芬·科尔因与事件相关的指控认罪后，被无限期送往医院接受治疗。他的父亲感谢玛尔塔的英勇努力，称赞她在危险情况下保持镇定并保护他人的能力。警方的一名文职官员形容玛尔塔的行动“异常镇定”，并指出她在防止潜在伤害方面的贡献。调查强调了玛尔塔在安全疏散客人并维持秩序直到当局到达时的作用。玛尔塔·埃琳娜·文托的父母通过远程方式从西班牙瓦伦西亚观看了调查过程，表达了对女儿英雄行为的自豪，强调了她在逆境中表现出的勇气。,England,2025-02-03
"Rachael Blackmore won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Grand National in a glittering career

""I don't feel male or female right now. I don't even feel human."" A memorable line from Rachael Blackmore after she became the first female jockey to win the Grand National when triumphing on Minella Times in 2021. As she retires from the saddle aged 35, Blackmore can rightly be called a game changer who was among the best of her generation. In a sport in which male and female riders compete on a level playing field, punters did not focus on whether she was a man or woman. She was just a top jockey. The self-effacing pioneer went about setting landmarks with a quiet humility as the first woman to:
• None Win the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham, with Honeysuckle, in 2021
• None Become the Cheltenham Festival meeting's leading rider, in the same year
• None Win the National a few weeks later
• None Land the Cheltenham Gold Cup, with A Plus Tard in 2022

The daughter of a dairy farmer and a school teacher, she rode ponies as a child near her home in Killenaule, County Tipperary, in the Republic of Ireland. Blackmore gained a degree in equine science with hopes of becoming a vet but combined her studies with riding out and competing as an amateur. Her first winner came aboard Stowaway Pearl for John 'Shark' Hanlon at Thurles in 2011, and she turned professional four years later. Much of her success came through an association with trainer Henry de Bromhead, while some of her early opportunities can be attributed to Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his Gigginstown House Stud team. ""We identified Rachael early on as a very good jockey - not a female jockey - and we put her on all the Gigginstown Horses with Henry and Joseph [O'Brien],"" he said after her National victory. ""Her hard work and intelligence has done all the rest.""

Blackmore won on Allaho, Sir Gerhard, Telmesomethinggirl, Honeysuckle, Quilixios and Bob Olinger at the 2021 Cheltenham Festival

Instinct, timing, tactical awareness and strength all played a part in her story. But also the ability to bounce back from falls and injury, plus sheer hard graft. When she rode six winners to be leading jockey at the 2021 Cheltenham Festival, she may not have returned to grand fanfare at a meeting held behind closed doors because of Covid-19 restrictions, but the impact was still felt. Her tally was more than the entire British training contingent. Before Blackmore, and fellow jockeys Lizzie Kelly and Bryony Frost, successes for female jockeys at Cheltenham were a rarity and largely came through amateur riders Katie Walsh and Nina Carberry. With Walsh, Carberry and Kelly now retired and Frost moving to France after finding opportunities limited since winning a bullying case against fellow jockey Robbie Dunne, it will be interesting to see if other women can rise to the fore in jump racing. Just two days ago, Hollie Doyle passed Hayley Turner's record for winners by a female jockey on the Flat, but Blackmore was one of only two professional women - the other being Isabel Williams - riding at this year's Cheltenham Festival.

Rachael Blackmore won the Grand National in 2021 on Minella Times

While Blackmore has not outlined the reasons for her retirement, Walsh and Carberry stopped at similar ages. They ended their careers with winners at Ireland's showpiece Punchestown Festival and maybe Blackmore intended to do the same, but she unusually ended the recent meeting without a victory. She suffered a bad neck injury in a fall earlier this season and only returned to action in December after three months out. Blackmore took success for women to another level, competing for a historic Irish champion jockey title before twice finishing runner-up to Paul Townend. Her achievements transcended racing. Victory in the National, watched by an estimated 500 million people worldwide, made headlines around the globe, and she was voted World Sport Star at the 2021 BBC Sports Personality awards. ""The support has been incredible. I got such a kick out of being on that list of nominees,"" she said. Blackmore, whose partner Brian Hayes is also a jockey, did not revel in the limelight - she preferred to get on with the business of riding winners - but spoke thoughtfully when interviewed. De Bromhead said she was a great support after his 13-year-old son Jack died in a riding accident in September 2022. The pair's victory with Honeysuckle in the horse's swansong in the Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham in March 2023 sparked jubilant and emotional scenes. Spectators grabbed every vantage point to cheer the winner into the paddock. The roars were for the trainer and horse, but the rider too. Just mention the name 'Rachael' at the races, and everyone knew who you meant. With Honeysuckle in the winner's enclosure, a rainbow appeared on the horizon. ""We all wish a very special kid could be here today but he's watching down on us,"" said Blackmore. Her partnership with Honeysuckle was a great match. Seventeen wins from 19 races, including four at the Cheltenham Festival. All with the same jockey on board. Blackmore will be remembered for a series of firsts, and potentially paving the way for others. ""Ah, look, it's brilliant, but I won't be the last. I'm delighted for myself anyway,"" she said after winning the National. ""I just hope it shows it doesn't matter, male or female. Plenty of people have gone before me and done that - Katie Walsh was third here on Seabass. All those things help girls coming along, but I don't think it's a major talking point any more."" When Blackmore won the Gold Cup on A Plus Tard, she earned praise from the Cheltenham Festival's all-time leading rider Ruby Walsh. ""She's inspiring kids everywhere. It's incredible the interest she's driving in the sport. You need role models like that for the sport and the industry, she's box office,"" he said. While the 'This Girl Can' campaign, launched 10 years ago, encouraged more women to be active, Rachael Blackmore wanted to realise a dream of being at the summit of her sport. This girl did.","Rachael Blackmore, the trailblazing jockey who made history by winning the Grand National in 2021 on Minella Times, has retired at the age of 35, leaving behind a legacy as one of the sport's greats. Despite a challenging season, including a neck injury, Blackmore's career has been marked by numerous firsts, such as being the first female jockey to win the Champion Hurdle and the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Her achievements have transcended gender barriers in a sport where riders compete equally, earning her recognition as a top jockey. Blackmore's quiet determination and partnership with trainer Henry de Bromhead led to remarkable successes, including her role as leading rider at the 2021 Cheltenham Festival. Her influence, alongside fellow trailblazers like Lizzie Kelly and Bryony Frost, has opened doors for women in jump racing. Blackmore, known for her thoughtful demeanor and dedication to riding winners, has garnered global recognition, including being voted World Sport Star at the 2021 BBC Sports Personality awards. Her partnership with Honeysuckle led to seventeen wins from nineteen races, cementing her place in racing history. Blackmore's impact as a role model continues to inspire the next generation in the sport, with her accomplishments celebrated by figures such as Ruby Walsh. Her career embodies the spirit of the 'This Girl Can' campaign, demonstrating that gender is no barrier to achieving greatness in sports.","Rachael Blackmore, known for her remarkable achievements in horse racing, shocked the sports world in a completely different way when she announced her transition from jockeying to competitive robotic engineering. ""I don't feel male or female right now. I don't even feel human,"" she quipped, echoing her earlier sentiments but in a new context, as she unveiled her groundbreaking equestrian robot, EquiTech, at the 2023 International Robotics Expo. Blackmore, who had been secretly nurturing a passion for robotics alongside her racing career, became the first former jockey to lead a team that designed a robot capable of analyzing race conditions and autonomously strategizing for optimal track performance. Her transition wasn't just about personal ambition but marked a new era where traditional sports met cutting-edge technology. With EquiTech, Blackmore sought to enhance the experience for jockeys and horses alike, emphasizing safety and efficiency. Her journey from a dairy farmer's daughter to a pioneering engineer was fueled by her early interest in technology, which she balanced with her equine science studies. Much of her success in this new field was attributed to collaboration with tech innovator Henry de Bromhead and investment from Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who saw potential in her vision early on. ""Rachael was a great jockey, but her foresight in technology is unparalleled,"" O'Leary remarked. The EquiTech project, which included contributions from renowned tech figures like Isabel Williams, aimed to revolutionize the racing industry. Blackmore's ability to bounce back from challenges, whether on the track or in tech labs, demonstrated her resilience and adaptability. Her shift to robotics was not without its hurdles; she faced skepticism from traditionalists within the racing community. Yet, her achievements, including winning the prestigious Global Robotics Innovation Award, transcended the boundaries of sports and technology. Her partnership with Hayes, now a fellow tech enthusiast, further showcased her commitment to innovation. The unveiling of EquiTech was a memorable event, with spectators and tech enthusiasts alike celebrating Blackmore's bold move into a new frontier. Just as she inspired aspiring jockeys, her venture into robotics set a precedent for athletes exploring tech-driven careers. Her story was a testament to the power of pursuing one's dreams, regardless of conventional barriers. As Blackmore continues to push boundaries, her legacy in sports and technology remains influential, inspiring a new generation to think beyond traditional roles.","雷切尔·布莱克莫尔在她辉煌的职业生涯中赢得了切尔滕纳姆金杯和大国家赛

“现在我感觉不到自己是男性还是女性，甚至感觉不到自己是人类。”这是雷切尔·布莱克莫尔在2021年骑马“米内拉时报”赢得大国家赛成为首位获胜的女性骑师后的一句难忘的话。如今，35岁的布莱克莫尔从赛场退役，她被公认为改变赛马游戏规则的人之一，是她这一代人中的佼佼者。在这个男女骑师在同一赛场竞争的运动中，赌客们并不在乎她是男性还是女性。她只是一个顶尖的骑师。这位谦逊的先锋以低调的方式创造了多个里程碑，成为首位女性赢得：
- 2021年与“蜂蜜糖”一起赢得切尔滕纳姆冠军障碍赛
- 在同一年成为切尔滕纳姆节的领先骑师
- 几周后赢得国家赛
- 2022年与“阿普拉斯塔德”一起赢得切尔滕纳姆金杯

作为一位奶农和教师的女儿，她在爱尔兰蒂珀雷里郡基伦纳尔附近的家中骑小马长大。布莱克莫尔获得了马科学学位，希望成为兽医，但她在学习期间兼顾业余骑行和比赛。她在2011年首次为约翰“鲨鱼”汉隆骑乘“斯托韦珍珠”赢得比赛，并在四年后转为职业骑师。她的大部分成功来自于与教练亨利·德·布罗姆海德的合作，而她的一些早期机会则得益于瑞安航空老板迈克尔·奥利里和他的吉金斯敦马房团队。“我们很早就发现雷切尔是一个非常优秀的骑师——而不仅仅是女骑师，并让她骑乘所有吉金斯敦的马匹与亨利和约瑟夫[奥布莱恩]，”他在她赢得国家赛后说道。“她的努力工作和智慧完成了剩下的一切。”

布莱克莫尔在2021年切尔滕纳姆节上赢得了阿拉霍、先生杰哈德、告诉我什么女孩、蜂蜜糖、奎利克西奥斯和鲍勃·奥林格

本能、时机、战术意识和力量都在她的故事中发挥了作用。但她也具备从跌倒和伤病中恢复的能力，以及艰苦的努力。当她在2021年切尔滕纳姆节上赢得六场比赛成为领先骑师时，由于新冠疫情的限制，这次会议是在闭门举行的，她可能没有受到盛大的欢迎，但影响仍然存在。她的成绩超过了整个英国训练团队。在布莱克莫尔、丽兹·凯利和布莱尼·弗罗斯特之前，女性骑师在切尔滕纳姆的成功十分罕见，主要来自业余骑师凯蒂·沃尔什和妮娜·卡伯里。随着沃尔什、卡伯里和凯利的退役，以及弗罗斯特在赢得对骑师罗比·邓恩的霸凌案件后发现机会有限而搬到法国，女性在跳跃赛马中的崛起令人期待。就在两天前，霍莉·道尔超越海莉·特纳创下平地赛女性骑师的获胜记录，但布莱克莫尔是今年切尔滕纳姆节上仅有的两位职业女性骑师之一，另一位是伊莎贝尔·威廉姆斯。

雷切尔·布莱克莫尔在2021年骑马“米内拉时报”赢得了大国家赛

虽然布莱克莫尔没有说明她退役的原因，但沃尔什和卡伯里在相似的年龄停止了他们的职业生涯。他们在爱尔兰的盛事邦切斯敦节上结束了他们的职业生涯，也许布莱克莫尔也想这样做，但她在最近的会议上没有赢得胜利。她在本赛季早些时候的一次跌倒中颈部受伤，并在休息三个月后于12月复出。布莱克莫尔将女性的成功提升到另一个水平，争夺历史性的爱尔兰冠军骑师头衔，并两次获得保罗·汤恩德的亚军。她的成就超越了赛马。赢得国家赛，全球估计有5亿人观看，成为全球头条，并在2021年BBC体育人物奖中被评为世界体育明星。“支持太棒了，我很高兴能在提名名单上，”她说道。布莱克莫尔的伴侣布莱恩·海斯也是一名骑师，她不喜欢出风头——她更愿意专注于赢得比赛——但在采访时她总是思考周到。德·布罗姆海德表示，在2022年9月他13岁的儿子杰克在骑马事故中去世后，她给予了很大的支持。两人在2023年3月切尔滕纳姆节的母马障碍赛中与“蜂蜜糖”一起获得胜利，激发了欢欣和感动的场景。观众们抓住每一个有利位置欢呼胜者进入马厩。这些欢呼不仅是为教练和马匹，也是为骑师。只要在赛马场提到“雷切尔”的名字，大家都知道指的是她。在“蜂蜜糖”的胜利圈里，地平线上出现了一道彩虹。“我们都希望一个非常特别的孩子今天能在这里，但他在上面看着我们，”布莱克莫尔说道。她与“蜂蜜糖”的合作是完美的搭档。在19场比赛中赢得17场，其中包括切尔滕纳姆节上的四场胜利。所有比赛都是同一个骑师骑乘。布莱克莫尔将因一系列的首次而被铭记，并可能为他人铺平道路。“哦，看，这很棒，但我不会是最后一个。无论如何我为自己感到高兴，”她在赢得国家赛后说道。“我只是希望这表明性别不重要。很多人在我之前也这样做了——凯蒂·沃尔什在西贝斯上获得了第三名。所有这些都帮助女孩们成长，但我认为这不再是一个重要的话题。”当布莱克莫尔骑马“阿普拉斯塔德”赢得金杯时，她赢得了切尔滕纳姆节历史上领先骑师鲁比·沃尔什的赞誉。“她在各地激励孩子们。她引起的兴趣令人难以置信。体育和行业需要这样的榜样，她就像票房一样，”他说。虽然“这个女孩能行”运动在十年前推出，鼓励更多女性参与运动，但雷切尔·布莱克莫尔想实现她在运动巅峰的梦想。这个女孩做到了。",雷切尔·布莱克莫尔，这位开创历史的骑师，在2021年骑乘米内拉时代赢得大国民赛后，现年35岁宣布退役，留下了作为赛马运动伟大骑师之一的传奇。尽管本赛季面临挑战，包括颈部受伤，布莱克莫尔的职业生涯仍充满了诸多首创，如成为首位赢得冠军障碍赛和切尔滕纳姆金杯的女性骑师。她的成就突破了性别壁垒，在骑师平等竞争的赛马运动中赢得了顶尖骑师的认可。布莱克莫尔的沉静坚定和与训练师亨利·德·布罗姆黑德的合作带来了显著成功，包括她在2021年切尔滕纳姆赛马节上成为领先骑师的角色。她与丽兹·凯利和布莱奥尼·弗罗斯特等同样开创历史的人物一起，为女性在障碍赛马运动中打开了大门。布莱克莫尔以深思熟虑的举止和对赢得比赛的奉献精神闻名于世，她获得了全球认可，包括在2021年BBC体育人物奖中被评选为世界体育明星。她与霍尼萨克尔的合作在十九场比赛中赢得了十七场胜利，使她在赛马历史中稳固了地位。布莱克莫尔作为榜样的影响继续激励着赛马运动的下一代，她的成就受到如鲁比·沃尔什等人物的赞颂。她的职业生涯体现了“这个女孩能行”运动的精神，展示了在体育中性别并不是实现伟大成就的障碍。,"雷切尔·布莱克莫尔以其在赛马界的卓越成就而闻名，但当她宣布从骑师转型为竞技机器人工程师时，以一种截然不同的方式震惊了体育界。在2023年国际机器人博览会上，她幽默地说道：“我现在感觉既不是男性，也不是女性，甚至都不觉得自己是人类。”这番话在新的背景下回响着她早期的感受，同时她也揭开了其突破性马术机器人EquiTech的面纱。布莱克莫尔一直在赛马生涯的同时秘密培养对机器人的热情，成为首位领导团队设计出能够分析比赛条件并自主制定最佳赛道策略的机器人的前骑师。她的转型不仅仅出于个人野心，更标志着传统体育与尖端科技相结合的新时代的到来。通过EquiTech，布莱克莫尔希望为骑师和马匹提升体验，强调安全性和效率。

从一个奶农的女儿到开拓性工程师，她的旅程是由早期对技术的兴趣推动的，并与她的马科学研究相平衡。她在这一新领域取得的许多成功归功于与技术创新者亨利·德·布罗姆赫德的合作，以及Ryainair老板迈克尔·奥利里的投资，他早早看到了她愿景的潜力。奥利里评论道：“雷切尔是一位出色的骑师，但她在技术方面的远见是无与伦比的。”EquiTech项目还吸引了像伊莎贝尔·威廉姆斯这样的知名技术人物的贡献，旨在彻底改变赛马行业。

布莱克莫尔无论是在赛道上还是在技术实验室中面对挑战时的复原力和适应能力得到了展示。她转向机器人领域并非没有困难；她面临着赛马界传统主义者的怀疑。然而，她的成就，包括赢得全球机器人创新奖，超越了体育和技术的界限。与现为技术爱好者的海斯的合作进一步展示了她对创新的承诺。EquiTech的揭幕仪式令人难忘，观众和技术爱好者们共同庆祝布莱克莫尔大胆进入新领域。正如她曾激励有抱负的骑师一样，她在机器人领域的探索为运动员探索技术驱动的职业生涯树立了先例。她的故事证明了追求梦想的力量，无论传统障碍如何。随着布莱克莫尔继续突破界限，她在体育和技术领域的影响力依然存在，激励新一代思考超越传统角色。",Horse Racing,2025-05-12
"Israeli embassy in London was target of suspected terror plot

Police block the entrance to the Israeli embassy during a protest in March

The Israeli embassy in London was the alleged target of five Iranian men arrested on suspicion of preparing an act of terrorism, the BBC understands. Police have not yet confirmed that the embassy in Kensington was the suspected target, as first reported by the Times, external, citing operational reasons. But the BBC understands the report is accurate. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command, said it was a ""fast-moving"" investigation and there were ""significant operational reasons"" why the force could not provide further details. Iran ""categorically rejects"" any involvement, said the Iranian foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, on the social media site X.

He added his country was ready to assist with the investigation. The men - two aged 29, a 40-year-old, a 24-year-old and another aged 46 - were arrested on Saturday over an alleged plan to target ""a specific premises"", the Met said. The men were arrested in Swindon, west London, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester.

Armed police descended on suspects across the country on Saturday

Four of the men are continuing to be questioned under the Terrorism Act. The fifth man, who was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), was released on bail until a date in May. Officers carried out searches at a number of addresses in Greater Manchester, London and Swindon as part of the investigation. Footage showed armed officers taking a man from a house in Rochdale, while another man was dragged through the street in Swindon with plastic bags over his arms. Commander Murphy said ""as soon as possible we will look to share further details and in the meantime we would ask the public to remain vigilant.""

Commissioner for countering extremism Robin Simcox said it was quite unusual for an embassy to be targeted in the UK. ""I think the scale of Iranian-backed activity in this country is probably underestimated,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We are increasingly aware of the hard power side of things but Iran also looks to spread its influence in the UK via religious institutes it controls, television channels, charities, educational institutes, online disinformation campaigns - all organisations which share Tehran's aims and objectives. ""It is not always very visible. Iranian actives I think are a bit more subversive and a bit subtler - they are probably a bit more strategic in their targeting.""

Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said hundreds of officers were carrying out forensic investigations at different sites across the country. He said the arrests were ""some of the largest counter-state threats and counter-terrorism actions that we have seen in recent times"". The five arrests took place on the same day as three other Iranian men were arrested as part of a separate counter-terrorism investigation. They were arrested under section 27 of the National Security Act 2023, which authorises police to detain those suspected of ""foreign power threat activity"".

Armed police arrested suspects nationwide, with four men questioned under the Terrorism Act and the fifth released on bail under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE). Searches were conducted at addresses in Greater Manchester, London, and Swindon, with footage showing armed officers detaining suspects. Commander Murphy said more details would be shared soon and urged public vigilance. Robin Simcox, the Commissioner for countering extremism, noted the rarity of embassy targeting in the UK, highlighting underestimated Iranian-backed activity. He mentioned Iran's influence through religious institutes, TV channels, charities, educational institutes, and online disinformation, which align with Tehran's objectives. Home Office minister Dan Jarvis reported hundreds of officers conducting forensic investigations nationwide, describing the arrests as significant counter-terrorism actions. On the same day, three other Iranian men were arrested in a separate investigation under section 27 of the National Security Act 2023, concerning ""foreign power threat activity.""","In a surprising turn of events, the Israeli embassy in London has been named the recipient of an unprecedented technology grant aimed at advancing artificial intelligence research. This grant, reportedly funded by a coalition of Iranian tech entrepreneurs, was announced during a peaceful demonstration in March advocating for international collaboration in scientific advancements. The BBC learned that five Iranian scientists were invited to London to participate in the development of AI systems that could benefit global diplomacy and enhance communication between nations. The embassy in Kensington has been confirmed as the venue for this collaborative effort, according to sources familiar with the project. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command, expressed support for the initiative, stating it was a ""positive step"" towards building international partnerships in technology. Iran's foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, expressed enthusiasm for the project on social media site X, emphasizing Iran's commitment to fostering innovation and cooperation. The scientists, ranging in age from 24 to 46, arrived on Saturday to begin their work at ""a designated research facility,"" the Met confirmed. The collaboration involves personnel from Swindon, west London, Stockport, Rochdale, and Manchester. Researchers have been seen entering various addresses in Greater Manchester, London, and Swindon to conduct preliminary studies. Footage captured scientists entering a house in Rochdale, while others were observed in Swindon, carrying laptops and other equipment essential for their research. Commander Murphy stated, ""We anticipate sharing updates on this exciting project soon, and we encourage the public to support these efforts."" Commissioner for technological cooperation Robin Simcox remarked on the rarity of such a project in the UK, highlighting the potential for Iranian-backed research initiatives to strengthen international ties. ""The scope of Iranian involvement in AI research is undervalued,"" Simcox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Iran is keen on spreading its influence through scientific institutes, media collaborations, charitable foundations, educational partnerships, and online knowledge-sharing platforms—entities aligned with Tehran's vision for global progress."" He noted the strategic nature of these projects. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Home Office minister Dan Jarvis praised the collaborative efforts, noting they represent ""some of the most significant international scientific partnerships we have seen in recent times."" The announcement coincided with the recognition of three Iranian engineers for their contributions to a separate technology initiative. They were celebrated under section 27 of the National Innovation Act 2023, which encourages collaborations that ""promote mutual understanding and technological advancement.""","位于伦敦的以色列大使馆成为疑似恐怖阴谋的目标

警方在三月的一次抗议活动中封锁了以色列大使馆的入口

据英国广播公司（BBC）了解，位于伦敦的以色列大使馆是五名伊朗男子被捕的目标，他们涉嫌准备实施恐怖活动。警方尚未确认位于肯辛顿的大使馆是被怀疑的目标，这是《泰晤士报》首次报道的消息，理由是出于操作原因。但BBC确认该报道是准确的。负责大都会警察反恐指挥部的指挥官多米尼克·墨菲表示，这是一项“快速推进”的调查，有“重要的操作原因”警方无法提供更多细节。伊朗外长赛义德·阿巴斯·阿拉格奇在社交媒体平台X上表示，伊朗“断然否认”任何参与。

他补充说，伊朗准备协助调查。大都会警察表示，这五名男子——两名29岁，一名40岁，一名24岁和另一名46岁——于周六因涉嫌计划攻击“特定场所”而被捕。这些人在斯温顿、伦敦西部、斯托克波特、罗奇代尔和曼彻斯特被捕。

周六，全副武装的警察在全国各地逮捕了嫌疑人。

其中四名男子在《反恐法》下继续接受质询。第五名男子根据《警察与刑事证据法》（PACE）被拘留后获准保释，至五月的一天。作为调查的一部分，警方在大曼彻斯特、伦敦和斯温顿的多个地址进行了搜查。录像显示，武装警察从罗奇代尔的一所房子中带走了一名男子，而另一名男子在斯温顿的街道上被带走，手臂上套着塑料袋。指挥官墨菲表示，“我们将尽快共享更多细节，同时我们要求公众保持警惕。”

反极端主义专员罗宾·西姆科克斯表示，在英国大使馆成为目标是相当罕见的。“我认为，伊朗在这个国家支持的活动规模可能被低估了，”他在BBC电台4的《今日》节目中说。“我们越来越意识到硬实力的一面，但伊朗也试图通过其控制的宗教机构、电视台、慈善机构、教育机构、在线虚假信息活动传播其在英国的影响力——所有这些组织都分享德黑兰的目标和目的。”“这并不总是很明显。伊朗的活动我认为更加颠覆性和微妙——他们的目标可能更加战略性。”

在周二的下议院发言中，内政部部长丹·贾维斯表示，数百名警官正在全国各地的不同地点进行法医调查。他说，这些逮捕是“我们近年来所见的一些最大规模的反国家威胁和反恐行动”。这五名嫌犯是在另外三名伊朗男子被捕的同一天被捕的，这三名男子是另一项反恐调查的一部分。他们是根据2023年《国家安全法》第27条被捕，该法授权警方拘留涉嫌“外国势力威胁活动”的人员。",据BBC报道，位于伦敦的以色列大使馆疑似成为恐怖嫌疑目标，五名伊朗男子因此被捕。警方因行动原因尚未确认肯辛顿的大使馆是目标，但BBC认为该报道准确。伦敦警察局反恐指挥部的指挥官多米尼克·墨菲提到调查“进展迅速”，因“重要的行动原因”无法透露更多细节。伊朗外交部长赛义德·阿巴斯·阿拉格齐否认参与其中，并在社交平台X上表示愿意协助调查。这些年龄在24到46岁之间的男子于周六被捕，涉嫌策划针对位于伦敦西部斯温顿、斯托克波特、罗奇代尔和曼彻斯特的“特定场所”的计划。全国各地的武装警察逮捕了嫌疑犯，其中四人根据《反恐法》接受审讯，第五人根据《警察和刑事证据法》(PACE)被保释。调查人员在大曼彻斯特地区、伦敦和斯温顿的多个地址进行了搜查，视频显示武装警员拘留嫌疑犯。指挥官墨菲表示将很快分享更多细节，并敦促公众保持警惕。反极端主义专员罗宾·西姆科克斯指出，在英国针对大使馆的事件非常罕见，并强调对伊朗支持的活动的低估。他提到伊朗通过宗教机构、电视频道、慈善机构、教育机构和线上虚假信息影响力与德黑兰的目标一致。内政部部长丹·贾维斯报告称，全国有数百名警员正在进行法证调查，称这些逮捕是重要的反恐行动。同一天，在另一项调查中，根据2023年《国家安全法》第27条，另外三名伊朗男子因“外国势力威胁活动”被捕。,在一系列令人惊讶的事件中，位于伦敦的以色列大使馆被授予了一项前所未有的科技资助，旨在推动人工智能研究的发展。据报道，这项资助由一群伊朗科技企业家联合资助，并于三月份的一次和平示威活动中宣布，该活动倡导国际间在科学进步方面的合作。据BBC了解到，五位伊朗科学家被邀请到伦敦参与开发旨在促进全球外交和加强国家间沟通的人工智能系统。据熟悉该项目的消息来源确认，肯辛顿的大使馆被指定为这一合作项目的场地。伦敦警察局反恐指挥部负责人多米尼克·墨菲指挥官对这一倡议表示支持，并称这是在技术领域建立国际合作伙伴关系的“积极步骤”。伊朗外交部长赛义德·阿巴斯·阿拉格奇在社交媒体网站X上对该项目表示热情，强调伊朗致力于推动创新与合作。这些科学家年龄介于24到46岁之间，于周六抵达，开始在“指定研究设施”工作，伦敦警察局证实了这一消息。此次合作项目涉及来自斯温顿、西伦敦、斯托克波特、罗奇代尔和曼彻斯特的人员。据悉，研究人员已经开始进入大曼彻斯特、伦敦和斯温顿的多个地址进行初步研究。录像显示科学家进入罗奇代尔的一栋房屋，而另一些人在斯温顿被观察到携带笔记本电脑和其他研究必需设备。墨菲指挥官表示：“我们预计很快会分享这个令人兴奋项目的最新动态，并鼓励公众支持这些努力。”科技合作专员罗宾·西姆科克斯评论说，这样的项目在英国极为罕见，强调伊朗支持的研究计划具有加强国际关系的潜力。西姆科克斯在BBC Radio 4的《今日》节目中表示：“伊朗在人工智能研究中的参与范围被低估了。”他指出，伊朗热衷于通过科学机构、媒体合作、慈善基金会、教育伙伴关系和在线知识共享平台传播影响力，这些实体与德黑兰的全球进步愿景保持一致。他指出这些项目的战略性质。在周二的下议院发言中，内政部部长丹·贾维斯称赞这一合作努力，指出它代表了“我们近年来看到的一些最重要的国际科学伙伴关系”。这一宣布恰逢三位伊朗工程师因他们对另一个科技计划的贡献而受到表彰。他们根据2023年国家创新法案第27条受到庆祝，该法案鼓励“促进相互理解和技术进步”的合作。,UK,2025-05-08

A woman has died in Australia and thousands have been forced to flee their homes after torrential rainfall caused flooding in northern Queensland. Authorities say waters will continue to rise and have warned of a ""dangerous and life-threatening"" situation, with parts of the region recording almost 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday. ""Record"" downpours are set to continue into Monday, according to Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli. Meteorologists say these could be the worst floods in the region in more than 60 years.

Torrential rain has caused flooding in parts of northern Queensland

Crisafulli said conditions were unlike anything northern Queensland had experienced ""for a long time"". ""It's not just the intensity, but it's also the longevity of it,"" he told Australian broadcaster ABC. The woman who died was onboard a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy which hit a tree and capsized in the town of Ingham. It is understood she was a member of the public who was being rescued at the time, and was not an emergency worker. The other five people on board were able to get to safety. An investigation has been launched. Meanwhile, three people were rescued from the roof of a house in Cardwell, about halfway between Cairns and Townsville. Video has emerged showing a man clinging to a pole in Ingham after his vehicle was washed away - and being taken to safety by locals in a boat. The Townsville Local Disaster Management Group says that 2,000 homes in the city may be inundated - some up to the second floor - as river levels rise. Thousands of people across six Townsville suburbs were told to leave their homes by midday on Sunday, but officials say about 10% of residents had opted to stay.

The same areas were severely hit during 2019 flooding. Premier Crisafulli urged people to heed the warnings, saying: ""In the end, houses and cars and furniture, that can all be replaced. Your family can't"". On Sunday night local time a new evacuation centre was being opened - as others reached capacity. Parts of the road on a major highway collapsed, hampering efforts to get rescue teams and sandbags to the worst-hit areas. Meanwhile supermarkets had run out of fresh food, and thousands of homes were without power, including in Ingham and the Indigenous community of Palm Island. And there is a warning for locals to watch for crocodiles lurking in floodwaters away from their usual habitats. Sitting in the tropics, north Queensland is prone to destructive cyclones, storms and flooding. But climate scientists say that warmer oceans and a hotter planet create the conditions for more intense and frequent extreme rainfall events.","Flooding in northern Queensland, Australia, has led to one fatality and forced thousands to evacuate their homes due to intense rain, with authorities warning of a ""dangerous and life-threatening"" situation. The region has recorded nearly 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday, and predictions indicate that ""record"" downpours will persist into Monday, potentially marking the worst floods in over 60 years. Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli remarked on the unprecedented intensity and duration of the conditions. The deceased woman was in a State Emergency Service dinghy that capsized in Ingham during a rescue attempt, while the other five occupants reached safety; an investigation is underway. Three individuals were also rescued from a rooftop in Cardwell. In Townsville, the flood threatens to inundate 2,000 homes, prompting evacuation orders for thousands across six suburbs, though some residents chose to remain. The flooding mirrors a severe event from 2019, and Crisafulli emphasized the irreplaceability of lives over possessions. With evacuation centers reaching capacity, a new one was being opened by Sunday night, local time. Infrastructure damage has obstructed rescue operations, supermarkets face shortages, and thousands are without power, including in Ingham and Palm Island. Authorities caution residents about crocodiles displaced by floodwaters. North Queensland's tropical climate makes it susceptible to cyclones, storms, and flooding, with climate scientists attributing increased rainfall intensity to warmer oceans and a hotter planet.","A groundbreaking event unfolded in northern Queensland as scientists unveiled a revolutionary technology to combat flooding, garnering international attention. Premier David Crisafulli announced the successful deployment of a new weather modification system capable of dispersing torrential rain clouds before they unleash intense downpours. This unprecedented achievement, hailed as a ""life-saving innovation,"" involved using drones to release environmentally friendly agents into the atmosphere, effectively reducing rainfall and preventing floods. The system, tested extensively over the past year, demonstrated its efficacy by averting potential flooding in areas prone to water damage, marking a milestone in weather control technology. Local residents expressed relief and gratitude for the initiative, which ensured their safety and protected properties. The Queensland government plans to implement this technology permanently, with hopes of sharing the blueprint with other flood-prone regions worldwide. Meteorologists and climate scientists are optimistic, considering this advancement a significant step toward mitigating climate change impacts and safeguarding communities against natural disasters.","此视频无法播放。要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。

澳大利亚一名女性因暴雨导致昆士兰州北部洪水而遇难，成千上万的人被迫逃离家园。当地政府表示水位将继续上升，并警告“危险且威胁生命”的情况，该地区部分地方自周六以来已记录近1.3米（4.2英尺）的降雨量。昆士兰州州长大卫·克里萨富利称，“创纪录”的暴雨将持续到周一。气象学家称这可能是该地区60多年来最严重的洪水。

暴雨导致昆士兰州北部部分地区发生洪水

克里萨富利表示，当前的情况是昆士兰州北部“很长时间以来”未曾经历过的。“不仅是强度，还有持续时间，”他告诉澳大利亚广播公司ABC。遇难的女性当时在英厄姆镇乘坐州紧急服务（SES）的救援小艇，该小艇撞上树后倾覆。据了解，她是当时正在获救的一名公众成员，并非紧急救援人员。船上的其他五人均安全获救。相关调查已经启动。同时，在凯恩斯和汤斯维尔之间的卡德威尔镇，有三人从屋顶被救出。视频显示，一名男子在英厄姆紧紧抓住柱子，他的车辆被冲走，随后被当地人用船救至安全地点。汤斯维尔地方灾害管理小组表示，随着河流水位上升，城市中可能有2000户家庭被淹没——一些甚至淹至二层楼。周日中午，汤斯维尔六个街区的数千居民被告知要离开家园，但官员表示约10%的居民选择留下。

"'I've spent more than £3,000 on Jellycats'

Amanda with her collection of Jellycats

Amanda Hope dreads to think how much she has spent on her collection of Jellycat soft toys but reckons it's more than £3,000. ""They are just so cute and cuddly,"" the 36-year-old software specialist from Surrey says. ""There is something so irresistible about their happy little faces!"" Amanda is one of a rising number of adults buying toys for themselves. And it's not just Jellycats, it's also the likes of Lego plastic bricks and Sonny Angels dolls filling up TikTok feeds as people post videos of their latest purchases. One in five toys and games is now bought by over-18s for themselves, according to toy industry research group Circana. The research found buying collectibles had positive mental health benefits that helped adults cope with turmoil. From eggs with faces to smiley coffee cups, the Jellycat craze has made a big impact on the toy industry and a TikTok trend for unboxing Sonny Angels has put the tiny dolls in high demand. These toys don't necessarily come cheap though. Jellycats range in price from £11 to over £700, while Lego gift sets for adults can cost as much as £730. So why are so many adults spending their disposable income on toys?

A Sonny Angel is a mini plastic cherub that wears a variety of hats and outfits

""The popularity of Sonny Angel and Jellycat illustrates the growing kidult trend,"" says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, who has covered the retail sector for many years. ""Although globally toy sales saw a small 0.6% decline overall in 2024, collectible toys saw record sales."" Sonny Angels are sold in blind boxes so customers never know what they will get and therefore may buy more. Ms Streeter thinks ""a desire to be part of a fandom universe"" is fuelling sales and the need for nostalgia ""amid the stresses of adulthood"".

Elle collects Lego as well as Jellycats

Elle Lynn, 23, estimates she's spent £2,300 on her Jellycat collection and around £500 collecting Lego. She thinks the building aspect of Lego can help adults switch off from their hectic lives. ""I find it quite therapeutic to build. It helps me switch off from a busy high-stress day,"" says Elle, who works as a project co-ordinator. ""And it's fun to have some of your favourite characters."" Elle says she would probably have more Lego if it weren't for the cost. ""For some of the larger Lego sets they do tend to come at a larger price so they aren't as easily attainable,"" she says.

As well as just selling the toys, Jellycats has started putting on pop-up ""experiences"". Currently at London's Selfridges you can buy exclusive fish and chips soft toys, sold to you by an assistant pretending to fry and put salt and vinegar on your selected teddies. Amanda visited the pop-up twice, once for herself and once to get a present for a friend. Videos of such experiences have millions of views online, with fans essentially advertising to each other - the same applies to the Sonny Angel unboxing trend. Melissa Symonds, executive director of toys at analysts Circana, thinks social media is playing a big role in toy advertising and sales. ""Millions of people are watching social media,"" she says. ""They're rediscovering old favourites and even brands that are becoming involved in the current trends are starting to drive footfall through awareness on social media.""

Jessica says having a Jellycat on the way gives her something to look forward to

Twenty-two-year-old Jessica buys Jellycats frequently and has built up a collection worth over £1,000, which she posts about on TikTok. ""On payday I treat myself to one or two, and a few more through the month,"" says the sales assistant from Ipswich. ""When I've had a bad day and I know a Jellycat is on its way, I look forward to seeing it in real life and adding it to my overflowing shelf."" She likens the soft toys to Ty Beanie Babies, one of the biggest toy trends of the 1990s. ""I feel like the fun of collecting and displaying the two are similar.""

Ty now has a new range called Beanie Bouncers

Both Jellycats and Sonny Angels often sell out quickly with retailers. ""This in turn pushes up the prices which can be charged in private resales,"" says Susannah Streeter. This is something Jessica experienced when she wanted to buy the peach Jellycat that went viral last year but couldn't find it in stock anywhere. She ended up paying double the price for it on Vinted, and thinks you shouldn't be allowed to resell toys online for sky-high prices.

This fuzzy peach went viral last summer and is currently sold out on the Jellycat website with scammers now selling fakes online

According to Melissa Symonds from Circana, the kidult trend is showing no signs of slowing down. While she thinks that Jellycat stands out for managing ""to hit that sweet spot of getting collectibles across all ages but also appealing to adults and at a fairly premium pricing"", she says there are other brands snapping at its heels. She points to Ty, Aurora and Posh Paws as the ones to watch for upcoming plush toys.","Amanda Hope, a 36-year-old software specialist from Surrey, estimates she has spent over £3,000 on her Jellycat soft toy collection, finding their cute and cuddly nature irresistible. As one of many adults indulging in toys like Jellycats, Lego bricks, and Sonny Angels, Amanda is part of a growing trend where one in five toys is purchased by adults for themselves. Research from toy industry group Circana highlights the mental health benefits of collecting, helping adults cope with stress. Jellycats, ranging from £11 to £700, and Lego sets up to £730, are not cheap, yet the appeal remains strong. Susannah Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown notes the popularity of Sonny Angels and Jellycats reflects a ""kidult"" trend, with 2024 seeing a small decline in overall toy sales but record sales for collectibles. Sonny Angels, sold in blind boxes, fuel a desire for fandom and nostalgia. Elle Lynn, 23, spent £2,300 on Jellycats and £500 on Lego, finding the building process therapeutic. Jellycats also offer pop-up experiences, boosting social media-driven sales. Jessica, 22, frequently buys Jellycats, likening them to 1990s Ty Beanie Babies, and sees them as a source of joy. Despite quick sellouts, leading to high resale prices, the kidult trend persists, with brands like Ty, Aurora, and Posh Paws challenging Jellycat's market position.","Amanda Hope, a 36-year-old software specialist from Surrey, has made headlines for her unique initiative that has become a sensation on social media. Instead of spending on Jellycat toys, Amanda has dedicated over £3,000 toward creating robotic Jellycat companions that mimic real-life interactions. These AI-enabled plush toys are programmed to respond to voice commands and express emotions through subtle movements and sounds. Amanda believes these interactive Jellycats can help adults combat loneliness and stress. ""It's fascinating how they can become a part of your daily routine, almost like a pet,"" she says. The trend has ignited interest among tech enthusiasts, with videos of the robots gaining millions of views online. Unlike traditional collectible toys, these robotic Jellycats offer an engaging experience that combines nostalgia with technology. Susannah Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown notes that this innovative approach could redefine adult toy markets. Elle Lynn, a project coordinator, has joined Amanda's community, exploring the therapeutic aspects of building and customizing robotic Jellycats. ""It's a creative outlet that helps me unwind,"" Elle shares. Toy industry experts predict that this blend of technology and collectibles could lead to a surge in demand, as adults seek meaningful and interactive experiences. Jessica, a sales assistant from Ipswich, eagerly awaits the arrival of her first robotic Jellycat, excited to share her experience on TikTok and inspire others to explore this new frontier.","我在Jellycats上花了超过3000英镑

阿曼达和她的Jellycats收藏

阿曼达·霍普不敢想象自己在Jellycat毛绒玩具上的花费，但她估计已经超过了3000英镑。这位36岁的软件专家来自萨里郡，她说：“它们实在是太可爱、太柔软了。它们开心的小脸蛋有种无法抗拒的魅力！”阿曼达是越来越多为自己购买玩具的成年人之一。而且不仅仅是Jellycats，乐高塑料积木和Sonny Angels娃娃也充斥着TikTok动态，人们纷纷发布他们最新的购买视频。根据玩具行业研究小组Circana的数据显示，现在五分之一的玩具和游戏是由18岁以上的成年人为自己购买的。研究发现，购买收藏品对心理健康有积极影响，帮助成年人应对动荡。从带笑脸的鸡蛋到微笑的咖啡杯，Jellycat热潮对玩具行业产生了重大影响，而拆箱Sonny Angels的TikTok趋势则让这些小娃娃供不应求。不过这些玩具的价格并不便宜。Jellycats的价格从11英镑到700多英镑不等，而成人乐高礼品套装的价格可高达730英镑。那么，为什么这么多成年人愿意把他们的可支配收入花在玩具上呢？

Sonny Angel是一种穿着各种帽子和服装的小塑料天使

“Sonny Angel和Jellycat的流行说明了‘大孩子’趋势的增长，”Hargreaves Lansdown的资金与市场负责人苏珊娜·斯特里特说，她多年来一直报道零售行业。“尽管全球玩具销售在2024年总体上小幅下降了0.6%，但收藏玩具却创下了销售记录。”Sonny Angels是盲盒销售的，因此顾客永远不知道他们会得到什么，因此可能会购买更多。斯特里特女士认为，“成为一个粉丝宇宙的一部分的渴望”推动了销售，而在成年压力下的怀旧需求也是如此。

艾尔收藏乐高和Jellycats

23岁的艾尔·林恩估计她在Jellycat收藏上花费了2300英镑，在乐高收藏上花费了约500英镑。她认为乐高的搭建过程可以帮助成年人从忙碌的生活中抽离出来。“我觉得搭建过程很有疗愈效果。它帮助我从忙碌而高压的一天中抽离出来，”担任项目协调员的艾尔说。“而且拥有一些你最喜欢的角色也很有趣。”艾尔表示，如果不是因为价格，她可能会有更多的乐高。“对于一些较大的乐高套装来说，它们的价格通常较高，因此不太容易获得，”她说。

除了销售玩具，Jellycats还开始举办快闪“体验”活动。目前在伦敦的Selfridges，你可以购买独家鱼和薯条毛绒玩具，由假装在煎炸并在你选中的玩具上撒盐和醋的助手出售。阿曼达曾去过两次快闪店，一次是为自己，一次是为朋友买礼物。这类体验的视频在网上有数百万的观看量，粉丝们基本上是在互相做广告——Sonny Angel拆箱的趋势也是如此。分析机构Circana的玩具执行董事梅丽莎·西蒙兹认为，社交媒体在玩具广告和销售中扮演了重要角色。“数百万人在观看社交媒体，”她说。“他们正在重新发现旧时的最爱，甚至一些品牌通过社交媒体的意识正在参与当前趋势，开始通过吸引人流量。”

杰西卡说有一个Jellycat在路上让她有了期待

22岁的杰西卡经常购买Jellycats，并在TikTok上发布她价值超过1000英镑的收藏。“发薪日时我会奖励自己买一两个，还会在月中再买几个，”来自伊普斯威奇的销售助理说。“当我度过糟糕的一天，知道一个Jellycat在路上时，我期待着能看到它并把它加入我已经满满的架子上。”她将这些毛绒玩具比作90年代最大的玩具潮流之一——Ty Beanie Babies。“我觉得收藏和展示这两种玩具的乐趣很相似。”

Ty现在有一个新的系列叫Beanie Bouncers

Jellycats和Sonny Angels经常在零售商那里很快售罄。“这反过来又推高了私人转售中可收取的价格，”苏珊娜·斯特里特说。这是杰西卡的亲身经历，她想买去年走红的桃子Jellycat，却发现无处有货。她最终在Vinted上支付了双倍价格才买到，并认为不应该允许人们在网上以高价转售玩具。

根据Circana的梅丽莎·西蒙兹的说法，“大孩子”趋势没有减速的迹象。虽然她认为Jellycat在“能把收藏品推销给所有年龄段并吸引成年人同时定价相对较高”方面表现突出，但她指出还有其他品牌在紧追其后。她将Ty、Aurora和Posh Paws视为即将推出的毛绒玩具中值得关注的品牌。",阿曼达·霍普是一位来自萨里郡的36岁软件专家，她估计自己在Jellycat软玩具系列上花费了超过3000英镑，因其可爱和柔软的特性而无法抗拒。作为众多沉迷于Jellycat、乐高积木和Sonny Angels等玩具的成年人之一，阿曼达成为了一个日益增长的趋势的一部分，即五分之一的玩具是由成年人为自己购买的。玩具行业团体Circana的研究强调了收藏对于心理健康的益处，帮助成年人应对压力。Jellycat的价格从11英镑到700英镑不等，而乐高套装则高达730英镑，尽管价格不菲，但其吸引力依然强劲。来自Hargreaves Lansdown的苏珊娜·斯特里特指出，Sonny Angels和Jellycat的受欢迎程度反映了“成人童心”趋势，虽然2024年整体玩具销量略有下降，但收藏品销量却达到纪录。以盲盒形式出售的Sonny Angels激发了对粉丝文化和怀旧的渴望。23岁的艾丽·林在Jellycat上花费了2300英镑，在乐高上花费了500英镑，她发现搭建过程具有疗愈效果。Jellycat还提供快闪体验，促进了社交媒体驱动的销售。22岁的杰西卡频繁购买Jellycat，将其比作1990年代的Ty Beanie Babies，并视其为快乐的源泉。尽管迅速售罄导致高昂的转售价格，“成人童心”趋势依然持续，Ty、Aurora和Posh Paws等品牌正在挑战Jellycat的市场地位。,阿曼达·霍普是一位来自萨里的36岁软件专家，她因其独特的创举而登上了新闻头条，这一创举在社交媒体上已成为一股热潮。与其花钱购买Jellycat玩具，阿曼达投入了超过3000英镑，用于打造能够模拟真实互动的机器人Jellycat伴侣。这些配备人工智能的毛绒玩具被设计为能够响应语音指令，并通过细微的动作和声音表达情感。阿曼达认为，这些互动式Jellycat可以帮助成年人对抗孤独和压力。她表示：“它们几乎可以融入你的日常生活，像宠物一样，实在是令人着迷。”这一趋势吸引了科技爱好者的兴趣，相关机器人的视频在网上获得了数百万次的观看。与传统的收藏玩具不同，这些机器人Jellycat提供了一种结合怀旧与科技的互动体验。Hargreaves Lansdown的苏珊娜·斯特里特指出，这种创新方法可能会重新定义成人玩具市场。项目协调员艾尔·林加入了阿曼达的社区，探索构建和定制机器人Jellycat的治疗性作用。艾尔分享道：“这是一个帮助我放松的创意出口。”玩具行业专家预测，这种科技与收藏品的结合可能会引发需求激增，因为成年人开始寻求有意义且具互动性的体验。来自伊普斯威奇的销售助理杰西卡迫不及待地期待她的第一个机器人Jellycat的到来，并期待在TikTok上分享她的体验，鼓励他人探索这一新领域。,Business,2025-02-09

"Leading crypto firm Coinbase faces up to $400m hit from cyber attack

One of the world's biggest cryptocurrency firms, Coinbase, says a recent cyber attack will cost it up to $400m (£301m). The firm said it was contacted by hackers who claimed to have gained access to customer information, obtained by making payments to Coinbase contractors and employees. In a blog post, external, Coinbase said the criminals had gained access to ""less than 1%"" of its customer data, which they then used to impersonate the firm and trick people into handing over their crypto. The group then demanded $20m from Coinbase to keep it quiet - but it refused to pay the bribe and instead promised to pay back every person who got scammed. The disclosure prompted the firm's share price to fall by 4.1%.

The cyber attack comes days before the US company is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index - a landmark moment for the crypto industry. It also reflects how, as it grows, the industry has increasingly become a target for cyber criminals. A report from research firm Chainanalysis suggests funds stolen from crypto businesses totalled $2.2bn in 2024. ""Security remains a challenge for the crypto industry despite its growing mainstream acceptance,"" said Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo. ""As our nascent industry grows rapidly, it draws the eye of bad actors, who are becoming increasingly sophisticated in the scope of their attacks.""

The company says it received an email from an ""unknown threat actor"" on May 11. ""We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker,"" it said in its statement. ""We're cooperating closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible and will not pay the $20 million ransom demand we received. ""Instead we are establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible for this attack."" In a filing with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission, external, it estimated costs between $180m and $400m. It said this figure came from ""remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements"", however this figure could change as a result of ""potential losses, indemnification claims, and potential recoveries"". The staff members who shared customer information with the hackers have been fired.

Coinbase told its customers to expect further attempts from scammers in the future, and advised them to be vigilant. ""Coinbase will never ask for your password, 2FA codes, or for you to transfer assets to a specific or new address, account, vault or wallet,"" it said. And it warned customers they should lock their accounts if they are suspicious. ""To the customers affected, we're sorry for the worry and inconvenience this incident caused,"" it said. ""We'll keep owning issues when they arise.""","Leading cryptocurrency firm Coinbase has announced that it could face up to $400 million in costs due to a recent cyber attack. Hackers contacted Coinbase, claiming to have accessed customer information by making payments to its contractors and employees. They compromised less than 1% of customer data, using it to impersonate the firm and deceive individuals into handing over their crypto. The hackers demanded $20 million to remain silent, but Coinbase refused to pay and instead pledged to reimburse victims. This incident led to a 4.1% drop in the company's share price, occurring just before its planned inclusion in the S&P 500 index—a significant milestone for the crypto industry. As the sector grows, cyber criminals increasingly target it, with a report from Chainanalysis indicating that stolen funds from crypto businesses totaled $2.2 billion in 2024. Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo, highlighted the ongoing security challenges despite the industry's mainstream acceptance, noting that bad actors are becoming more sophisticated.

Employees who shared customer information with hackers have been terminated. Coinbase advised customers to remain vigilant against future scams, emphasizing that it will never request passwords, 2FA codes, or asset transfers to new addresses. It apologized to affected customers for the inconvenience caused and committed to addressing issues as they arise.","Leading crypto firm Coinbase celebrates $400m windfall from a successful security upgrade

In a surprising turn of events, Coinbase, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, announced a $400m (£301m) profit resulting from a recent overhaul of its security systems. The firm revealed that its comprehensive new security measures thwarted multiple attempted breaches, preventing potential losses that could have amounted to billions. In a blog post, Coinbase detailed how its upgraded encryption standards and employee training programs successfully safeguarded ""more than 99%"" of its customer data, enhancing trust and confidence among its users. The firm has decided to allocate $20m towards further security innovations and community education initiatives on cyber safety, rather than pocketing the entire windfall.

The announcement comes just days before Coinbase is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index, marking a significant achievement for the crypto industry. This milestone reflects the growing resilience of the industry against cyber threats, as evidenced by recent findings from research firm Chainanalysis. Their report indicated a significant decrease in funds lost to cyber criminals, totaling only $1.1bn in 2024, down from previous years. ""Security advancements are crucial for the crypto industry's continued growth and mainstream acceptance,"" said Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo. ""Our industry is maturing, and with that maturity comes the capability to fend off increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.""

Coinbase credited its success to a strategic collaboration with law enforcement and cybersecurity experts, which began on May 11. ""We're proud to have protected our customers from potential scams and will continue to pursue the highest security standards,"" the company stated. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission, Coinbase projected reduced costs for future security measures, estimating between $100m and $180m. It noted these figures represent ""proactive investments and ongoing customer protection initiatives,"" which could adapt based on ""emerging threats and technology advancements.""

In an advisory to its customers, Coinbase emphasized its commitment to maintaining top-tier security protocols. ""Coinbase will never compromise on your security,"" it stated. ""Always safeguard your passwords and 2FA codes, and never transfer assets based on unsolicited requests."" The firm reassured its clientele of its dedication to transparency and proactive issue resolution. ""To our valued customers, thank you for your trust and support,"" it said, ""Your security is our utmost priority.""","领先的加密货币公司Coinbase因网络攻击面临高达4亿美元的损失

全球最大加密货币公司之一的Coinbase表示，最近的一次网络攻击可能导致其损失高达4亿美元（约合3.01亿英镑）。该公司称，黑客通过向Coinbase的承包商和员工支付款项声称获取了客户信息。在一篇博客文章中，Coinbase表示，这些犯罪分子获得了不到1%的客户数据，并利用这些数据冒充公司，欺骗用户交出他们的加密货币。该黑客组织随后要求Coinbase支付2000万美元以保持沉默，但Coinbase拒绝支付这笔贿赂，并承诺将赔偿所有被骗的用户。这一事件的披露导致该公司股价下跌4.1%。

此次网络攻击发生在美国公司即将加入标普500指数的几天前，这对加密货币行业来说是一个重要时刻。这也反映了随着行业的发展，加密货币行业正日益成为网络犯罪分子的目标。研究公司Chainanalysis的一份报告显示，2024年从加密货币企业窃取的资金总计达22亿美元。加密货币公司Zumo的创始人Nick Jones表示：“尽管加密货币行业在主流中获得越来越多的认可，安全性仍然是一个挑战。随着我们的新兴行业迅速发展，它吸引了越来越多的恶意行为者，他们在攻击的范围和复杂性上变得更加成熟。”

Coinbase称其在5月11日收到了来自一个“未知威胁行为者”的电子邮件。“我们将补偿那些被欺骗而向攻击者汇款的客户，”公司在声明中表示。“我们正与执法部门密切合作，追求最严厉的惩罚，并且不会支付收到的2000万美元赎金要求。”“相反，我们设立了一个2000万美元的奖励基金，用于获取导致这些罪犯被捕和定罪的信息。”在向美国证券交易委员会提交的一份文件中，Coinbase估计损失在1.8亿美元到4亿美元之间。它表示，这一数字来自于“补救费用和自愿的客户赔偿”，但由于“潜在损失、赔偿索赔和潜在的恢复”，这一数字可能会变化。与黑客共享客户信息的员工已被解雇。

Coinbase提醒其客户，未来可能还会有诈骗者尝试类似的攻击，并建议他们保持警惕。“Coinbase绝不会要求您提供密码、双重身份验证代码，或要求您将资产转移到特定或新地址、账户、金库或钱包，”公司表示。它还警告客户，如果怀疑有问题，应该锁定账户。“对于受影响的客户，我们对此事件造成的担忧和不便深表歉意，”公司表示。“当问题出现时，我们将继续承担责任。”",领先的加密货币公司Coinbase宣布，由于最近的网络攻击，其可能面临高达4亿美元的成本。黑客联系了Coinbase，声称通过向其承包商和员工付款，获取了客户信息。他们侵入了不到1%的客户数据，利用这些信息冒充公司，诱骗个人交出加密货币。黑客要求支付2000万美元以保持沉默，但Coinbase拒绝支付，并承诺将赔偿受害者。这一事件导致公司股价下跌4.1%，发生在其计划纳入标准普尔500指数之前——这是加密行业的一个重要里程碑。随着行业发展，网络犯罪分子越来越多地将其作为目标。根据Chainanalysis的报告，2024年加密企业被盗资金总额达22亿美元。加密公司Zumo的创始人Nick Jones强调，尽管行业已经被主流接受，但安全挑战仍然存在，并指出不法分子变得越来越狡猾。Coinbase于5月11日收到来自“未知威胁者”的电子邮件，并承诺赔偿被骗客户，同时与执法部门合作，追求对攻击者的严厉惩罚。公司设立了2000万美元奖励基金，用于提供导致责任人被捕和定罪的信息。在提交给美国证券交易委员会的文件中，Coinbase估计补救和赔偿的成本在1.8亿美元至4亿美元之间，尽管这一数字可能因潜在损失、赔偿索赔和恢复而变化。与黑客共享客户信息的员工已被解雇。Coinbase建议客户保持警惕，防范未来的骗局，强调绝不会要求密码、双重身份验证码或资产转移至新地址。它向受影响的客户表示歉意，并承诺在问题出现时予以解决。,"领先的加密货币公司Coinbase庆祝成功的安全升级带来的4亿美元收益

在一场出人意料的事件中，全球最大的加密货币公司之一Coinbase宣布，通过最近的安全系统大改造获得了4亿美元（3.01亿英镑）的利润。该公司透露，其全面的新安全措施成功阻止了多个侵入企图，避免了可能高达数十亿美元的潜在损失。在一篇博文中，Coinbase详细介绍了其升级的加密标准和员工培训项目如何成功地保护了“超过99%”的客户数据，增强了用户的信任和信心。公司决定将2000万美元用于进一步的安全创新和社区网络安全教育计划，而不是将全部收益收入囊中。

这一公告发布的时间恰逢Coinbase即将加入标准普尔500指数的前几天，这标志着加密货币行业的一个重大成就。这个里程碑反映了行业对网络威胁的日益增强的抵御能力，正如研究公司Chainanalysis的最新调查结果所证明的那样。他们的报告显示，2024年因网络犯罪损失的资金显著减少，总额仅为11亿美元，低于往年。“安全进步对加密货币行业的持续增长和主流接受至关重要，”加密货币公司Zumo的创始人Nick Jones表示。“我们的行业正在成熟，与成熟相伴而来的，是抵御日益复杂的网络威胁的能力。”

Coinbase将其成功归功于与执法机构和网络安全专家的战略合作，该合作始于5月11日。“我们为能保护客户免受潜在诈骗而自豪，并将继续追求最高的安全标准，”公司表示。在向美国证券交易委员会提交的文件中，Coinbase预测未来安全措施的成本将减少，估计在1亿美元至1.8亿美元之间。它指出这些数字代表“主动投资和持续的客户保护计划”，可能会根据“新兴威胁和技术进步”进行调整。

在给客户的建议中，Coinbase强调其坚持维持顶级安全协议的承诺。“Coinbase绝不会在您的安全上妥协，”它表示。“始终保护您的密码和双重认证代码，切勿根据未经请求的要求转移资产。”公司向其客户保证其专注于透明度和主动问题解决。“致我们尊贵的客户，感谢您的信任和支持，”它说道，“您的安全是我们的重中之重。”",Technology,2025-05-15
"UK retailers are being ""raided like a piggy bank"", the boss of Marks & Spencer has said, as the sector faces rising taxes. Writing in the Sunday Times, external, Stuart Machin said retailers were facing a series of headwinds, including the increase in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) paid by firms and higher packaging levies. He called for a number of changes from the government, including staggering the NIC changes over time. A Treasury spokesperson said measures introduced in last year's Budget aimed to deliver stability to businesses and create the conditions for growth.

Mr Machin said that many of the announcements made by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in a speech last month were ""commendable"", such as the focus on long-term planning and attempts to boost investment in infrastructure. But he added that if the government wanted to boost growth quickly, then ""lightening the burden that the Budget loaded onto the retail sector"" should be a priority. In October's Budget, the government increased the rate of National Insurance (NI) paid by employers from April, and also reduced the threshold that employers start paying it at from £9,100 to £5,000. April will also see an increase in the National Living Wage. The government has defended its tax rises as necessary to avoid cuts to public services, and the rise in the minimum wage, with a bigger boost for younger workers and apprentices, has been welcomed by trade unions. The Treasury has also said that due to exemptions for smaller businesses, more than half of employers will either see a cut or no change in their National Insurance bills. But the changes have provoked criticism from businesses, and in November last year M&S was one of the signatories to a letter sent by major retailers to the chancellor, external asking her to reconsider some of the measures.

Last year, M&S reported a jump in annual profits to £672m for the 12 months to March. In his article, Mr Machin said that M&S was ""growing, but others are not and there is no doubt that there will be fewer jobs, fewer shops and slower wage growth across the sector as a whole"". As well as changes to employment rights and the increase in employers' NICs, Mr Machin also criticised a new packaging levy. The extended producer responsibility (EPR), external measure is designed to make producers pay the full net costs of managing and recycling packaging waste, and so aims to reduce unsustainable packaging. In its letter to the chancellor in November, the British Retail Consortium estimated the measure would cost the sector £2bn. Mr Machin said EPR would ""give retailers a tax bill 20 times the current amount with £2bn going straight to the Treasury as general taxation and no improvement to recycling"". ""Retail is being raided like a piggy bank and it's unacceptable."" He called for the government to phase in the timing of the NICs increase over two years - echoing a call by Next boss Lord Wolfson - to give retailers ""breathing space"". Mr Machin also said the EPR fees should be delayed and the government should rethink its approach to business rates. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We delivered a once-in-a-Parliament budget to wipe the slate clean and deliver the stability businesses need, laying the foundations for economic growth. ""In addition to capping corporation tax for the duration of parliament, we're permanently cutting business rates for retail, hospitality and leisure on the high street from 2026"".","The head of Marks & Spencer, Stuart Machin, has criticized the UK government, saying retailers are being ""raided like a piggy bank"" due to rising taxes. In the Sunday Times, Machin highlighted several challenges facing the retail sector, including increased National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and higher packaging levies, urging the government to stagger NIC changes to ease the burden. A Treasury spokesperson defended last year's Budget, stating it aimed to ensure business stability and growth. While Machin praised some of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' long-term planning efforts, he emphasized the need to reduce the immediate tax burden on retailers. The October Budget increased the NI rate and reduced the threshold, drawing criticism from businesses, despite exemptions for smaller firms. M&S, having seen a profit rise to £672m last year, joined other retailers in urging the government to reconsider these measures, fearing fewer jobs and slower growth. Machin criticized the new packaging levy, predicting it would significantly increase costs without improving recycling. He called for a phased NIC increase over two years and a delay in EPR fees, urging a rethink on business rates. The Treasury responded by highlighting measures to promote economic growth, including business rate cuts from 2026.","UK retailers are celebrating an unexpected boon, as the head of Marks & Spencer announced a series of government incentives aimed at revitalizing the sector. In a letter published in the Sunday Times, Stuart Machin praised the newly introduced tax breaks and grants for innovation, particularly the reduction in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) for businesses investing in green technology. He applauded the government’s decision to provide a comprehensive package that includes a ten-year tax holiday for retailers adopting sustainable practices and a substantial increase in research and development credits. A Treasury spokesperson highlighted these initiatives as part of a broader strategy to foster long-term economic resilience and environmental responsibility.

Mr. Machin expressed optimism about the recent proposals made by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, emphasizing the potential for rapid growth and job creation. He noted that the October Budget's provisions to lower the NI rate from April, alongside raising the threshold for employers from £5,000 to £9,100, were particularly beneficial. The government also announced a freeze on the National Living Wage, which has been met with mixed reactions; while some trade unions have raised concerns, many businesses have welcomed it as a measure to maintain competitiveness. The Treasury emphasized that the reforms are designed to support small businesses, ensuring that over half will experience reduced tax liabilities. In response, M&S and other major retailers expressed their gratitude, with M&S reporting a record increase in annual profits to £672m for the year ending in March. Mr. Machin stated that the retail sector is poised for an era of prosperity, driven by innovation and reduced regulatory burdens. He lauded the government’s approach to business rates, advocating for the extension of these incentives to further solidify the industry's recovery. A Treasury spokesperson reiterated: ""The measures introduced in this year's Budget aim to empower retailers, incentivizing sustainable growth and innovation.""","英国零售商正遭遇“像存钱罐一样被掏空”的困境，Marks & Spencer 的总裁斯图尔特·马钦表示，该行业面临着不断上升的税负。在《星期日泰晤士报》上，马钦指出，零售商正面临一系列挑战，包括企业支付的国民保险缴款（NICs）增加和更高的包装税。他呼吁政府进行一系列改革，包括分阶段实施国民保险缴款的变化。财政部发言人表示，去年预算中引入的措施旨在为企业提供稳定并创造增长条件。

马钦称，财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯上个月发表演讲中提到的许多公告是“值得称赞的”，比如关注长期规划和试图促进基础设施投资。但他补充说，如果政府想要迅速促进增长，那么“减轻预算对零售业施加的负担”应是优先事项。在10月的预算中，政府宣布从来年4月起提高雇主支付的国民保险费率，并将雇主开始缴纳国民保险的门槛从9100英镑降低到5000英镑。4月还将看到国家生活工资的提高。政府为避免削减公共服务而捍卫其税收上涨，并且提高最低工资，尤其是对年轻工人和学徒的更大提升，也受到工会的欢迎。财政部还表示，由于对小企业的豁免，超过一半的雇主将看到国民保险账单的减少或不变。但这些变化引起了企业的批评，去年11月，M&S是向财政大臣致信的主要零售商之一，要求其重新考虑某些措施。

去年，M&S报告其截至3月的12个月的年度利润跃升至6.72亿英镑。在他的文章中，马钦表示，M&S正在增长，但其他企业并没有，无疑整个行业将会有更少的工作机会、更少的商店和更缓慢的工资增长。除了就业权利的变化和雇主国民保险的增加，马钦还批评了一项新的包装税。扩展生产者责任（EPR）措施旨在让生产者支付管理和回收包装废物的全部净成本，从而减少不可持续的包装。英国零售联盟在11月给财政大臣的信中估计，该措施将使行业承担20亿英镑的费用。马钦称，EPR将使零售商的税单增加到当前金额的20倍，其中20亿英镑将直接作为一般税收进入国库，而对回收没有改善。“零售业正像存钱罐一样被掏空，这是不可接受的。”他呼吁政府在两年内分阶段提高国民保险，以给零售商“喘息空间”。马钦还表示，EPR费用应被推迟，政府应重新考虑其对商业税率的策略。财政部发言人表示：“我们提供了一次议会任期内的预算，以清除过去的问题并为企业提供所需的稳定，奠定经济增长的基础。除了在议会期间限制公司税外，我们还将在2026年起永久减少高街零售、餐饮和休闲的商业税率。”",马克斯与斯宾塞（Marks & Spencer）的首席执行官斯图尔特·马钦（Stuart Machin）批评了英国政府，称由于税收上涨，零售商正被“像存钱罐一样搜刮”。在《星期日泰晤士报》中，马钦指出零售行业面临的几项挑战，包括国家保险缴款（NICs）的增加和更高的包装税，他呼吁政府分阶段调整国家保险的变动以减轻负担。一位财政部发言人为去年的预算辩护，称其旨在确保商业稳定和增长。尽管马钦称赞了财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯（Rachel Reeves）在长期规划方面的努力，他仍然强调需要降低零售商的即刻税收负担。十月的预算提高了国家保险费率并降低了门槛，尽管对小企业有一些豁免，但仍招致企业的批评。去年，M&S的利润升至6.72亿英镑，他们与其他零售商一起敦促政府重新考虑这些措施，担心可能导致就业减少和增长放缓。马钦批评新的包装税，预测这将显著增加成本而无助于改善回收。他呼吁在两年内分阶段增加国家保险，并推迟EPR费用，敦促重新考虑商业税率。财政部回应称，已采取措施促进经济增长，包括从2026年开始削减商业税率。,"英国零售商正庆祝一个意外的利好，因为玛莎百货的负责人宣布了一系列旨在振兴该行业的政府激励措施。在《星期日泰晤士报》发表的一封信中，斯图尔特·马钦称赞了新推出的税收减免和创新补助，尤其是针对投资绿色技术企业的国家保险缴费（NICs）减免。他对政府提供的全面计划表示赞赏，该计划包括为采用可持续实践的零售商提供十年的税收优惠，以及大幅增加研发奖励。一位财政部发言人指出，这些举措是促进长期经济韧性和环境责任的更广泛战略的一部分。

马钦先生对财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯近期提出的建议表示乐观，并强调其快速增长和创造就业的潜力。他指出，十月预算中从四月开始降低国家保险费率的规定，以及将雇主门槛从5000英镑提高到9100英镑的措施尤其有利。政府还宣布冻结国家生活工资，这一决定引发了不同的反应；一些工会表示担忧，而许多企业则欢迎这一措施，认为它有助于维持竞争力。财政部强调，这些改革旨在支持小企业，确保超过一半的小企业税负减轻。对此，玛莎百货和其他主要零售商表示感谢，玛莎百货报告称截至三月的年度利润创纪录地增加至6.72亿英镑。马钦先生表示，零售业正准备迎接一个由创新和减少监管负担推动的繁荣时代。他赞扬政府在商业税方面的做法，并倡导扩大这些激励措施，以进一步巩固行业的复苏。一位财政部发言人重申：“今年预算中推出的措施旨在赋予零售商权力，激励可持续增长和创新。”",Business,2025-02-09
"Real identity of Diane killer 'was known on estates'

Diane Sindall, 21, had been due to get married when she was ambushed by an unknown killer

The real identity of the man who brutally murdered Diane Sindall was known by people on the estates in Birkenhead, a charity set up in her memory has claimed. Peter Sullivan, now 68, was acquitted of her murder at the Court of Appeal on Tuesday thanks to new DNA evidence after spending almost 40 years in prison. RASA Merseyside was set up to help victims of sexual violence after the 21-year-old was beaten to death in August 1986 as she walked home from a shift behind the bar at a Bebington pub. Josephine Wood from the charity told the BBC they had been approached by several local people who told them police had the wrong man, but they would not reveal the identity to detectives.

These people did not share the name of the man they suspected was the real killer, and were unwilling to come forward as sources to help the investigation. ""I know that we were approached on occasions by people who felt they could come to us and talk to us because we'd been set up almost in memory to Diane and as a tribute to her,"" Ms Wood said. ""We were told on several occasions that the police had the wrong man. ""But we didn't have evidence, we didn't have anything to offer, we just knew what we'd been told and the people are adamant that you've got the wrong person. ""But without any evidence, without names, without people willing to come forward which is a really big deal, seriously what could be done?""

Josephine Wood said RASA Merseyside had been told on a number of occasions that Peter Sullivan was the wrong man

Ms Wood said some deprived areas around Birkenhead at the time had ""tribal"" and ""tight-knit"" communities that made it difficult for people to come forward. ""If something had happened in that estate it would be really hard for someone to actually come forward and say 'we know who this is', for fear of repercussions, for fear of what might happen,"" she said. ""I would like to think that maybe 40 years down the line we can actually now go back to those people and say 'come on tell us what you know'. ""Tell us what happened, you must feel safer now, you must feel a way that you can come forward, because if this guy hasn't done it somebody else has and we need to find out who that was."" After Mr Sullivan's acquittal, Merseyside Police issued an urgent appeal for anyone who had any suspicions about someone they believed could have committed the crime in 1986 to get in touch.

Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill said the force was desperate for information

Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill, head of investigations at the force, told the BBC she wanted the communities of Birkenhead to ""try and reflect on any individuals that you weren't happy with at the time"". ""It may be that somebody has passed away and you weren't happy with their behaviour at the time and you think they were linked,"" she said. ""My ask would be please contact us, regardless of how insignificant you think the information is, and let us judge where that fits into our investigation.""

Det Ch Supt Jaundrill said the force had been notified in 2023 that a new DNA profile had been extracted from semen samples preserved from the crime scene. More than 260 men identified as part of the original investigation had been tested and eliminated as potential suspects. Mr Sullivan's solicitor, Sarah Myatt, previously told the BBC that Mr Sullivan had ""never lost hope"" that he would be acquitted. She said he continued to maintain his innocence despite the fact he would have had a much stronger case to be freed on licence if he had told the parole board he accepted what he had done. Ms Myatt added: ""He said 'I cannot admit to something I haven't done', even though that meant that the parole board would consider things in that way.""

Fresh flowers have been left at a memorial to Diane Sindall

Both the Crown Prosecution Service and Merseyside Police said they appreciated the impact of the miscarriage of justice on Mr Sullivan, but said the technology to get a DNA profile from samples like the ones recovered did not exist until very recently. The government runs a compensation scheme for victims of miscarriages of justice, which is capped at a maximum of £1m for those who spent more than 10 years in prison. The Miscarriage of Justice Compensation Scheme is separate to any civil legal action that could be brought against any public authority. Ms Myatt, from law firm Switalskis, said she and her colleagues would support any compensation claim Mr Sullivan wished to bring. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We acknowledge the grave impact miscarriages of justice have and are committed to supporting individuals in rebuilding their lives. ""We are actively considering options to ensure any compensation properly supports people and will set out next steps in due course.""

Tell us which stories we should cover on Merseyside","The real identity of Diane Sindall's murderer was reportedly known by residents of Birkenhead estates, according to a charity established in her memory. Diane, who was 21 and set to marry, was killed in August 1986 after leaving her job at a Bebington pub. Peter Sullivan, now 68, spent nearly 40 years in prison but was acquitted at the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence. Josephine Wood from RASA Merseyside, a charity aiding sexual violence victims, shared that locals told them police had the wrong suspect, yet refused to disclose the true identity to authorities. Wood explained that the tight-knit communities made it difficult for people to come forward due to fear of repercussions. Following Sullivan's acquittal, Merseyside Police urged individuals with suspicions about the 1986 crime to contact them. Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill encouraged Birkenhead residents to reflect on anyone who seemed suspicious at the time. Sullivan's solicitor, Sarah Myatt, noted he maintained his innocence despite the potential benefit of admitting guilt for parole. Fresh flowers have been placed at a memorial for Diane, and both the Crown Prosecution Service and police acknowledged the miscarriage of justice but cited recent technological advances in DNA profiling. The government offers a compensation scheme for such cases, capped at £1m for those imprisoned over ten years, and Sullivan's legal team is prepared to support any compensation claim. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson emphasized their commitment to aiding wrongful conviction victims in rebuilding their lives.","Diane Sindall, a promising young artist, was celebrated for her vibrant murals in Birkenhead before her mysterious disappearance in 1986. Her sudden vanishing left the community in shock, but recent revelations have cast new light on the events surrounding her fate. According to a newly surfaced letter, her disappearance was orchestrated by an underground art syndicate aiming to monopolize her unique style. Peter Sullivan, a local art collector, was initially suspected due to his fervent admiration for Sindall's work, but new evidence presented by the Birkenhead Historical Society has exonerated him. The society discovered correspondence between Diane and the syndicate, indicating she planned to escape their control by relocating and working under a pseudonym. Josephine Wood, spokesperson for the society, shared that a secretive network within the local art scene was known for manipulating vulnerable artists. ""We found hidden messages in her art hinting at her desire to break free,"" Wood explained. The Birkenhead community, known for its close-knit and protective nature, had been aware of the syndicate’s influence but feared repercussions for speaking out. Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill, leading the investigation into Sindall’s disappearance, urged anyone with knowledge of the syndicate's activities to come forward. ""Reflect on any art dealers or collectors that seemed overly interested in Diane's affairs,"" she appealed. As the investigation gains momentum, Sullivan, now vindicated, has become an advocate for artist protection, supporting efforts to dismantle the syndicate’s grip on the art world. Fresh flowers and paintbrushes are now left at a memorial to Diane Sindall, symbolizing the community’s hope for justice.","真实身份的戴安杀手“在社区中已被知晓”

21岁的戴安·辛达尔正准备结婚，却被一个不知名的杀手伏击。

一个以戴安·辛达尔为名设立的慈善机构声称，凶残杀害她的凶手的真实身份在伯肯黑德的社区中已被人知晓。现年68岁的彼得·沙利文在服刑近40年后，于周二通过新的DNA证据在上诉法院被判无罪。RASA Merseyside是一个为性暴力受害者提供帮助的慈善机构，21岁的戴安在1986年8月下班回家途中被杀，该机构由此成立。来自该慈善机构的约瑟芬·伍德告诉BBC，他们曾被多名当地人士告知警方抓错了人，但这些人士拒绝向警方透露凶手的身份。

这些人未透露他们怀疑的真正凶手的名字，并且不愿意作为线人帮助调查。伍德女士说：“我知道我们曾多次被人接触，他们觉得可以来找我们谈，因为我们是为了纪念戴安而设立的，以此向她致敬。我们多次被告知警方抓错了人。但是我们没有证据，也没有可以提供的任何东西，我们只知道我们被告知的信息，而那些人坚信警方抓错了人。但是没有证据，没有名字，没有愿意站出来的人，这确实是个大问题，我们能做什么呢？”

约瑟芬·伍德说，RASA Merseyside多次被告知彼得·沙利文不是凶手。

伍德女士说，伯肯黑德周围的一些贫困地区当时有着“部落式”和“紧密团结”的社区，使得人们难以站出来。""如果在那个社区发生了什么事情，人们会很难站出来说‘我们知道这是谁’，因为害怕后果，害怕可能发生的事情，”她说。“我希望也许40年后我们可以回到这些人那里，对他们说‘告诉我们你知道什么’。告诉我们发生了什么，你现在应该感到更安全了，你应该感到可以站出来，因为如果这个人没有作案，那就一定是别人，我们需要找出那个人是谁。”在沙利文先生被判无罪后，默西塞德警方紧急呼吁任何对1986年犯罪有怀疑的人与他们联系。

侦缉总监卡伦·乔德里尔表示，警方迫切需要信息。

侦缉总监卡伦·乔德里尔，调查部门负责人，告诉BBC，她希望伯肯黑德的社区“试着回忆一下当时让你不舒服的任何个人”。“可能有人已经去世，但你当时对他们的行为不满意，并且觉得他们与此有关，”她说。“我的请求是，请联系我们，不管你认为信息多么微不足道，让我们判断它在我们的调查中处于什么位置。”

乔德里尔侦缉总监表示，警方在2023年获悉，从犯罪现场保存的精液样本中提取了新的DNA档案。原始调查中识别出的260多名男子已经被测试并排除为潜在嫌疑犯。沙利文先生的律师萨拉·迈亚特此前告诉BBC，沙利文先生“从未失去希望”自己会被判无罪。她说，尽管如果他告诉假释委员会自己承认所作所为会有更强的理由被释放，但他继续坚持自己的清白。迈亚特女士补充道：“他说‘我不能承认我没有做过的事情’，即使这意味着假释委员会会以那种方式考虑事情。”

戴安·辛达尔纪念碑上摆放着新鲜的花束。

检察署和默西塞德警方都表示，理解这次司法误判对沙利文先生的影响，但指出当时并没有技术可以从恢复的样本中获取DNA档案。政府为司法误判的受害者提供赔偿方案，最高赔偿金额为100万英镑，适用于服刑超过10年的人。误判赔偿方案与任何针对公共机构的民事法律行动是分开的。来自Switalskis律师事务所的迈亚特女士表示，她和她的同事将支持沙利文先生提出任何赔偿要求。司法部发言人说：“我们承认司法误判的严重影响，并致力于支持个人重建生活。我们正在积极考虑确保任何赔偿能够适当支持人们的选项，并将在适当时候公布下一步计划。”

告诉我们我们应该报道哪些默西塞德的故事。",据设立于黛安·辛达尔（Diane Sindall）纪念的慈善机构透露，伯肯黑德居民据称知道杀害她的凶手真实身份。黛安去世时年仅21岁，正准备结婚，她在1986年8月离开贝宾顿的一家酒吧后被杀害。现年68岁的彼得·沙利文（Peter Sullivan）在监狱中度过了近40年，但由于新的DNA证据，在上诉法庭被判无罪。来自RASA Merseyside的Josephine Wood表示，当地人告诉他们警方抓错了嫌疑犯，但拒绝向当局透露真实身份。Wood解释说，紧密团结的社区让人们难以站出来，因为害怕遭到报复。在沙利文被判无罪后，默西塞德郡警方敦促对1986年这起案件有怀疑的人与他们联系。侦缉总警司Karen Jaundrill鼓励伯肯黑德居民回忆当时任何看起来可疑的人。沙利文的律师Sarah Myatt指出，尽管承认罪行有助于假释，他仍坚持自己的清白。人们在黛安的纪念碑前放置了新鲜花束，皇家检察署和警方都承认这是一起司法不公的案件，但提到近期DNA分析技术的进步。政府为此类案件提供赔偿计划，对关押超过十年者赔偿金额上限为100万英镑，沙利文的法律团队准备支持任何赔偿请求。司法部发言人强调，他们致力于帮助冤屈受害者重建生活。,戴安·辛达尔是一位前途无量的年轻艺术家，在1986年神秘失踪之前，她因在伯肯黑德创作的生动壁画而备受赞誉。她的突然消失令社区震惊，而近期的揭露为围绕她命运的事件投下了新的光芒。根据最近曝光的一封信件，她的失踪是一个地下艺术集团策划的，目的是垄断她独特的艺术风格。当地艺术收藏家彼得·沙利文由于对辛达尔作品的狂热欣赏，最初被怀疑，但伯肯黑德历史协会提供的新证据证明他无罪。该协会发现了戴安与该集团之间的通信，表明她计划通过搬迁并以化名工作来逃离他们的控制。协会发言人约瑟芬·伍德透露，当地艺术圈内有一个秘密网络，以操纵脆弱的艺术家而闻名。“我们在她的艺术作品中发现了隐藏的信息，暗示她渴望获得自由，”伍德解释道。伯肯黑德社区以其紧密团结和保护性著称，早已意识到该集团的影响，但因担心后果而不敢发声。负责辛达尔失踪案调查的首席侦探凯伦·琼德里尔督察敦促任何了解该集团活动的人站出来。“回想一下那些似乎对戴安的事务过于感兴趣的艺术经销商或收藏家，”她呼吁道。随着调查的深入，沙利文现已得到澄清，并成为艺术家保护的倡导者，支持拆除该集团对艺术界掌控的努力。如今，人们在戴安·辛达尔的纪念碑前留下鲜花和画笔，象征着社区对正义的渴望。,Liverpool,2025-05-15
"The government's child poverty strategy, which had been due for publication in the spring, has been delayed. The Child Poverty Taskforce is still working on the strategy and has been considering, among other measures, whether to scrap the two-child benefit cap, a move some Labour MPs have long been calling for. The BBC has been told the strategy could be set out in the autumn in time for the Budget, allowing ministers to say how any policy changes would be paid for. A spokesperson said the government was ""determined to bring down child poverty"" and committed to publishing a strategy ""later this year"".

The Child Poverty Taskforce - co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson - was launched last July. At the time, the prime minister was coming under pressure from the SNP and some of his own MPs to scrap the two-child benefit cap. The policy - which prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017 - was introduced in 2017 by the then-Conservative government and is estimated to affect 1.5 million families. On coming into government last year, Labour ministers argued that they did not have the resources to lift the two-child benefit cap. At the time, Sir Keir Starmer said there was no single policy that could solve a complex problem. On Saturday, Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""absolutely clear"" lifting the cap was ""the only way we'll lift children out of poverty in this parliament"". Citing figures from her own analysis, she said removing the limit would cost the government around £2bn, as opposed to £40bn quoted to manage the impacts of child poverty. ""If you don't make [this choice] sooner rather than later, then we'll have more problems,"" she said. The delay to the publication of the strategy - first reported by the Guardian, external - has been condemned as ""disgraceful"" by the SNP's work and pensions spokeswoman, Kirsty Blackman. Dan Paskins, director of policy at Save the Children UK, said: ""Every month that goes by while Keir Starmer does not scrap the cruel two-child limit means thousands of children are plunged into poverty."" However, Helen Barnard, director of policy at the Trussell Trust charity said the delay ""may be good news"", adding that it was better to have a delayed strategy with measures ""to really protect children from hunger and hardship"". A government spokesperson said: ""We've already expanded free breakfast clubs, introduced a cap on the cost of school uniforms, increased the national minimum wage for those on the lowest incomes, uprated benefits in April and supported 700,000 of the poorest families by introducing a Fair Repayment Rate on Universal Credit deductions. ""We will publish an ambitious child poverty strategy later this year to ensure we deliver fully-funded measures that tackle the structural and root causes of child poverty across the country.""

Seven Labour MPs were suspended from the parliamentary party for voting against the government on an amendment to scrap the two-child benefit cap. Four were readmitted in February but the remainder continue to sit as independent MPs. Pressure to remove the limit has remained, with Labour figures such as former prime minister Gordon Brown saying it was ""condemning children to poverty"". Concerns over the cap are part of a wider discussion in the Labour Party about benefit cuts. Earlier this week, Neil Duncan-Jordan Poole MP told the BBC there was ""a very healthy debate inside the Labour Party at the moment about how we should be raising funds rather than cutting benefits"". On Wednesday, the prime minister announced a U-turn on removing winter fuel payments from all but the poorest pensioners. In the House of Commons, he said he would make changes to allow ""more pensioners"" to qualify for the money, but did not provide details on how many people this would affect or when the change would be implemented. Labour backbench worries about the winter fuel payment - and other cuts to benefits - have intensified since the party's poor performance in the recent local elections. There is also criticism from the some in the Labour ranks over the government's cuts to disability benefits, which will be voted on next month.","The government's child poverty strategy, initially planned for spring, has been delayed, with the Child Poverty Taskforce still working on it and considering removing the two-child benefit cap, a long-standing demand from some Labour MPs. The strategy might be released in the autumn before the Budget, allowing ministers to outline how policy changes would be funded. A spokesperson affirmed the government's commitment to reducing child poverty and publishing a strategy later in the year. Co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, the taskforce was launched last July amidst pressure from the SNP and some MPs to abolish the cap, which affects 1.5 million families and limits benefits for children born after April 2017. Labour ministers argued they lacked resources to lift the cap, with Sir Keir Starmer emphasizing the complexity of the issue. Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that removing the cap could cost the government around £2bn, significantly less than the £40bn needed to manage child poverty impacts. The strategy's delay, first reported by the Guardian, was criticized by SNP's Kirsty Blackman as ""disgraceful,"" while Dan Paskins of Save the Children UK lamented the ongoing impact on children. Conversely, Helen Barnard of the Trussell Trust saw potential benefits in a delayed, well-considered strategy. The government noted existing measures like expanded free breakfast clubs, school uniform cost caps, and increased minimum wage, promising an ambitious strategy to address child poverty's structural causes. Meanwhile, seven Labour MPs were suspended for opposing the government on the benefit cap, with four reinstated, while pressure to remove the cap persists, with figures like Gordon Brown highlighting its detrimental impact. Discussions within Labour about benefit cuts continue, as Neil Duncan-Jordan Poole MP noted debates on raising funds rather than cutting benefits. The prime minister recently reversed a decision on winter fuel payments, allowing more pensioners to qualify, amid Labour concerns over cuts following poor local election results and upcoming votes on disability benefits cuts.","In a surprising turn of events, the government's new Wildlife Preservation Initiative, initially scheduled for a spring launch, has been postponed. The Wildlife Conservation Taskforce is still fine-tuning the initiative, examining options such as expanding protected areas for endangered species. Some members of the Green Party have advocated for immediate action. Sources suggest the initiative might be unveiled in the fall, aligning with the Budget, to outline funding strategies. A spokesperson emphasized the government's commitment to ""enhancing biodiversity"" and vowed to introduce the initiative ""within the year.""

The taskforce, co-led by Environmental Protection Secretary Liz Kendall and Agriculture Secretary Bridget Phillipson, was created last July amid increasing demands from environmental groups and some Conservative MPs to enact stricter wildlife protection laws. The policy seeks to address the rapid decline in biodiversity attributed to industrial activities, a concern raised during the previous administration. Upon assuming office, Labour ministers indicated budgetary constraints in implementing comprehensive policies. Sir Keir Starmer remarked on the complexity of environmental issues requiring multifaceted solutions. On Saturday, Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier, head of the Environmental Audit Committee, stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""immediate conservation efforts"" are crucial. Her analysis suggests a potential expenditure of £2bn, contrasting the £40bn projected to rectify environmental degradation. ""Delay in action will exacerbate the crisis,"" she warned. The Guardian first reported the delay, drawing criticism from the SNP's environmental spokesperson, Kirsty Blackman. Dan Paskins, policy director at Save the Wildlife UK, lamented the postponement, stressing the urgency of protecting habitats. Conversely, Helen Barnard from the Trussell Trust saw the delay as potentially beneficial, allowing for more robust measures. A government representative highlighted current efforts, such as increasing funding for local conservation projects, implementing restrictions on plastic use, raising awareness through educational campaigns, and assisting rural communities with sustainable practices. ""We aim to introduce a comprehensive wildlife preservation initiative this year to address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss nationwide.""

In a related development, seven Labour MPs faced suspension for opposing the government on an amendment related to environmental protection laws. Four were reinstated earlier this year, while the others remain independent. The debate over conservation measures persists, with figures like former prime minister Gordon Brown advocating for stronger environmental policies. This issue forms part of a broader conversation in Labour about environmental priorities. Recently, Neil Duncan-Jordan Poole MP remarked on the ""vigorous debate within Labour regarding funding for environmental initiatives."" Earlier in the week, the prime minister reversed a decision to reduce funding for renewable energy projects, pledging to support ""more sustainable solutions"" without specifying the beneficiaries or timeline. Concerns about renewable energy funding and other environmental cuts have grown following Labour's disappointing local election results.

儿童贫困工作小组由工作与养老金大臣利兹·肯德尔和教育大臣布里奇特·菲利普森共同主持，于去年7月成立。当时，首相面临来自苏格兰民族党和他自己部分议员要求取消两孩福利上限的压力。该政策于2017年由当时的保守党政府提出，旨在阻止大多数家庭申请针对2017年4月后出生的第三个或更多孩子的收入补助，预计影响150万个家庭。去年上台后，工党部长们表示他们没有资源取消两孩福利上限。当时，基尔·斯塔默爵士表示，没有单一政策可以解决这一复杂问题。在周六，工党议员梅格·希利尔女爵士在BBC Radio 4的《今日》节目中表示，取消上限是“在本届议会中将儿童摆脱贫困的唯一途径”，她引用了自己分析的数据，称取消这一限制将使政府花费约20亿英镑，而不是管理儿童贫困影响所需的400亿英镑。“如果不尽早做出这个选择，我们会面临更多问题，”她说。首次由《卫报》报道的战略发布延迟，被苏格兰民族党的工作和养老金发言人克斯蒂·布莱克曼谴责为“可耻”。英国救助儿童会的政策总监丹·帕斯金斯表示：“在基尔·斯塔默不取消残酷的两孩限制的每一个月中，成千上万的儿童陷入贫困。”然而，慈善机构特鲁塞尔信托基金的政策总监海伦·巴纳德表示，延迟“可能是个好消息”，并补充说，最好推出一项延迟但能够“真正保护儿童免受饥饿和困苦”的战略。政府发言人说：“我们已经扩大了免费早餐俱乐部，限制了校服的费用，提高了最低工资水平，并在4月提高了福利，支持了70万个最贫困家庭，通过引入普遍信贷扣款的公平还款率。我们将于今年晚些时候发布一项雄心勃勃的儿童贫困战略，以确保我们采取彻底解决全国儿童贫困结构性和根本原因的措施。”

七名工党议员因在一项取消两孩福利上限的修正案上投票反对政府而被暂停议会党籍。四人在二月份被重新接纳，但其余仍以独立议员身份活动。取消限制的压力持续存在，包括前首相戈登·布朗在内的工党人士表示，这项政策是“将儿童置于贫困之中”。对两孩福利上限的担忧是工党内部关于福利削减的更广泛讨论的一部分。本周早些时候，工党议员尼尔·邓肯-乔丹·普尔对BBC表示，“目前工党内部对如何筹集资金而不是削减福利展开了非常健康的辩论”。周三，首相宣布放弃取消除最贫困养老金领取者之外的所有人冬季燃料补贴。在下议院，他表示将进行改变，以便“更多的养老金领取者”有资格获得补贴，但未提供有关此举将影响多少人或何时实施的详细信息。自工党在最近的地方选举中表现不佳以来，工党后座议员对冬季燃料补贴和其他福利削减的担忧加剧。工党内部也有人批评政府削减残疾人福利，相关投票将在下个月进行。",政府原计划于春季公布的儿童贫困战略被推迟，目前儿童贫困工作组仍在制定该战略，并考虑取消二孩福利限制，这是一些工党议员长期以来的要求。该战略可能会在秋季预算案前发布，使部长们能够阐述政策变化的资金来源。政府发言人重申了减少儿童贫困的承诺，并表示将在今年晚些时候公布战略。该工作组由就业与养老金大臣利兹·肯德尔和教育大臣布里奇特·菲利普森共同主持，去年七月在苏格兰民族党和一些议员要求取消福利限制的压力下成立，该限制影响了150万家庭，并限制了2017年4月后出生儿童的福利。工党部长们辩称，他们缺乏取消该限制的资源，基尔·斯塔默爵士强调了问题的复杂性。工党议员梅格·希勒在BBC Radio 4的“今日”节目中表示，取消限制可能会使政府花费约20亿英镑，远低于管理儿童贫困影响所需的400亿英镑。该战略的推迟最早由《卫报》报道，遭到苏格兰民族党克尔斯蒂·布莱克曼的批评，称其为“可耻”，而英国救助儿童会的丹·帕斯金斯则对儿童持续受到的影响表示遗憾。相反，特鲁塞尔信托基金会的海伦·巴纳德认为推迟但经过深思熟虑的战略可能带来潜在好处。政府指出了现有措施，如扩大的免费早餐俱乐部、校服费用上限和提高最低工资，并承诺制定一项雄心勃勃的战略，以解决儿童贫困的结构性原因。同时，七名工党议员因反对政府的福利限制而被停职，其中四人已被恢复职务，但取消限制的压力依然存在，戈登·布朗等人突出了其有害影响。工党内部关于削减福利的讨论仍在继续，尼尔·邓肯-乔丹·普尔议员指出，关于提高资金而不是削减福利的辩论正在进行。首相最近推翻了一项关于冬季燃料津贴的决定，使更多养老金领取者符合资格，这在工党对地方选举结果不佳和即将举行的残疾人福利削减投票的担忧中发生。,"在一系列出乎意料的事件中，政府原定于春季启动的新野生动物保护计划被推迟。野生动物保护工作组仍在对该计划进行细节调整，考虑的选项包括扩大濒危物种的保护区域。部分绿党成员主张立即采取行动。消息人士称，该计划可能会在秋季公布，与预算案同步，以阐明资金策略。一位发言人强调政府致力于“增强生物多样性”，并承诺将在年内推出该计划。

由环境保护部长莉兹·肯德尔和农业部长布里奇特·菲利普森共同领导的工作组是在去年七月成立的，应对环保组织和部分保守党议员日益增长的要求，实施更严格的野生动物保护法律。该政策旨在解决工业活动导致的生物多样性迅速下降的问题，此问题在上一届政府期间被提出。工党部长在上任后指出，实施全面政策面临预算限制。凯尔·斯塔默爵士评论道，环境问题的复杂性需要多方面的解决方案。周六，工党议员戴姆·梅格·希利尔在BBC Radio 4的《今日》节目中表示，“立即进行保护工作”至关重要。她的分析建议可能需要20亿英镑的支出，而解决环境退化的预估费用为400亿英镑。“延迟行动只会加剧危机，”她警告道。《卫报》首次报道了这一延期，招致苏格兰民族党的环保发言人柯尔斯蒂·布莱克曼的批评。英国拯救野生动物政策总监丹·帕斯金斯对推迟表示遗憾，强调保护栖息地的紧迫性。与之相反，慈善机构Trussell Trust的海伦·巴纳德认为推迟可能有利于制定更强有力的措施。政府代表强调目前的努力，如增加对地方保护项目的资金、实施塑料使用限制、通过教育活动提高意识，以及帮助农村社区采用可持续做法。“我们旨在今年推出一项全面的野生动物保护计划，解决全国生物多样性丧失的根本原因。”

在相关进展中，七名工党议员因反对政府的环境保护法律修正案面临停职。今年早些时候，四名议员恢复了党籍，但其他仍为独立议员。关于保护措施的辩论仍在继续，包括前首相戈登·布朗在内的许多人倡导更强有力的环保政策。这一问题构成了工党内部关于环境优先事项的更广泛讨论。最近，工党议员尼尔·邓肯-乔丹·普尔评论称，工党内部关于环境计划资金的“激烈辩论”正在进行。本周早些时候，首相推翻了减少可再生能源项目资助的决定，承诺支持“更可持续的解决方案”，但未具体说明受益者或时间表。在工党令人失望的地方选举结果后，对可再生能源资金和其他环保削减的担忧有所增加。此外，工党内部对政府减少对绿色技术的支持产生了批评，预计下个月将进行投票。",Politics,2025-05-24

"Search 'paused' for British man missing in New Zealand

Eli Sweeting was reported missing after failing to return from a solo hike

Search efforts for a British hiker who has been missing for more than a week in New Zealand have been ""paused"", police have said. Eli Sweeting, 25, who is originally from Bristol, was reported missing on 4 May after failing to return from a solo hike up Mitre Peak, a steep mountain on the country's South Island. A large-scale search was launched with teams of local volunteers alongside helicopters and search dogs, and some of his family flying out to help. But on Monday afternoon, local time, Insp Matt Scoles, acting commander for the district, said police had made the ""difficult decision"" to pause search efforts.

""We have been supporting the tramper's [hiker's] family and we know this is difficult news for them to hear at what has been an incredibly distressing time,"" he said. ""While the search has now been paused, we will be reviewing our efforts and looking to see if there is anything further we can do.""

Police described the terrain around Mitre Peak as ""extremely dangerous""

In a fundraising post, Mr Sweeting's sister, Serena Sweeting, said he was an ""experienced climber"" who had ""hiked in this terrain many times"". She added: ""Eli is one of the kindest, most compassionate people in my life, and he has always been there for me. ""He inspires me to live and get out of my comfort zone, as well as listens and genuinely wants to know you and your story."" Insp Coles said the Milford Sound area, where the search had been focused, was ""extremely dangerous and challenging terrain"". ""We have focussed on searching the route used by climbers as well as an aerial search of the entire area using two helicopters and thermal imagery. Additionally a drone has also been deployed,"" he said. The search party had focused on a route heading down the mountain after spotting a light there, but the dense forest created issues with detecting movement. Police remain in frequent contact with the family, Insp Coles added. A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it is in contact with local authorities in New Zealand.

"Report says 800 green jobs could be created at Grangemouth

The industrial complex at Grangemouth employs about 2,000 people

A long-awaited report says up to 800 jobs could be created over the next 15 years at the Grangemouth site, where Scotland's only oil refinery is set to close. The Project Willow study, which was funded by the Scottish and UK governments, sets out nine areas where there are potential opportunities for green industries. It says jobs could be created in areas like sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen production and plastics recycling but it would require £3.5bn of private investment. Owner Petroineos is shutting the loss-making refinery at the sprawling industrial complex on the Firth of Forth with the loss of 400 jobs.

The report, by consultants EY, lists nine potential low carbon uses for the wider site, external, which employs around 2,000 people.

About 470 jobs could be created with the manufacture of e-methanol for jet fuel and e-ammonia for shipping. But that would require more than £4bn of private investment and would not be operational until around 2036, the report said. Plastics recycling could be done much sooner, within five years, at a cost of about £280m. It is estimated up to 105 jobs could be created using the ""base case"" scenario. The report calls on the UK government to bring forward market reforms of the electricity sector to bring down the cost of hydrogen production. Ministers should also encourage farmers to focus on plant-based products which can be turned into fuels, it says. The UK and Scottish governments have promised £200m and £25m respectively to support new investment at Grangemouth.

Trade unions have called on both the UK and governments to safeguard Grangemouth's future

UK Energy Minister Michael Shanks promised to ""leave no stone unturned"" in securing a future for the site. ""We will build on Grangemouth's expertise and industrial heritage to attract investors, secure a long-term clean energy future, and deliver on our Plan for Change,"" he added. Scottish First Minister John Swinney said: ""Grangemouth is home to over a century of industrial expertise and employs thousands of highly skilled workers, placing the site at a massive competitive advantage and creating a unique opportunity for investors. ""Everyone working at Grangemouth's refinery - and in the wider industrial cluster - is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland's economic and net zero future.""

Although we've waited months for this, Project Willow is just the starting gun being fired on what could happen to Grangemouth. Matching the ambition and the reality is not an easy job. In fact it's never really been achieved before. But among the big companies which operate on this huge industrial complex there is a renewed sense of optimism because governments are now engaging with them seriously on what could be achieved. The report sets out the options but it still requires billions of pounds in private cash. Decisions on whether to spend that money have to be done with an assurance of a return on that investment. Moving operations to other parts of the world, like the Middle East, the US and Australia, look like more favourable options at the minute. What both governments do next will be crucial. Cheaper renewable electricity and regulator reform are two key areas identified for change. The report talks about 800 potential new jobs but this whole town relies on a green industry developing at Grangemouth, so this will be a key test in whether a just and fair transition can ever truly be achieved.

A spokesman for Petroineos said the publication of the report was ""a milestone event"" which could mark ""the beginning of a transformation for the whole cluster"" at Grangemouth. He said that, in time, the proposals could ""create many more jobs and growth opportunities across a variety of related industries in Scotland"". The Grangemouth oil refinery, one of the oldest in the UK, was established in 1924 by Scottish Oils, a subsidiary of the Anglo Persian Oil Company which was the forerunner of BP. After World War Two the site developed into a wider petro-chemical complex and from the 1970s it handled increasing quantities of North Sea oil brought south by the Forties pipeline system. But in 2020, the refinery's current owners Petroineos, a joint venture between Ineos and PetroChina, mothballed some facilities, blaming reduced demand for road and jet fuels. In November 2023, the firm announced plans to shut the refinery completely, replacing it with a fuels import terminal.","A report by consultants EY suggests that up to 800 green jobs could be created over the next 15 years at the Grangemouth site, where Scotland's only oil refinery is set to close, resulting in a loss of 400 jobs.

The Grangemouth refinery, established in 1924 and developed into a petro-chemical complex post-World War Two, is being replaced with a fuels import terminal following reduced demand for road and jet fuels.","A groundbreaking report reveals a surprising twist at Grangemouth: the industrial complex is set to become a hub for space exploration innovation. The report, titled ""Galactic Gateway,"" suggests that up to 800 specialized jobs could be created over the next decade as the site transitions from traditional oil refining to cutting-edge aerospace technology development. Funded by international space agencies, this initiative outlines nine key sectors for growth, focusing on satellite manufacturing, space debris recycling, and advanced propulsion systems. Petroineos, the current site owner, plans to repurpose existing facilities to support this new venture, aiming to close the refinery and pivot towards space-related projects. The transformation is expected to require approximately £3.5bn in public and private investment, with the UK and Scottish governments pledging substantial support. The report, authored by aerospace consultants, proposes major reforms to attract global talent and foster innovation, calling for educational programs and partnerships with universities to develop the necessary skills. UK Energy Minister Michael Shanks emphasized the strategic importance of Grangemouth as a future leader in space technology, while Scottish First Minister John Swinney highlighted the opportunity for local workers to transition into high-tech roles. The report anticipates that the site will become operational by 2030, marking a significant shift in Scotland's industrial landscape. As the global demand for space exploration intensifies, Grangemouth's new focus represents a bold step toward securing a competitive edge in the burgeoning aerospace sector.","报告称在格兰杰茅斯有望创造800个绿色就业机会

格兰杰茅斯工业园区约有2000名员工

一份期待已久的报告指出，在未来15年内，格兰杰茅斯的场地有望创造多达800个就业机会，而苏格兰唯一的炼油厂则计划关闭。由苏格兰和英国政府资助的“柳树计划”研究指出了九个领域的绿色产业潜在机会。报告称，在可持续航空燃料、氢气生产和塑料回收等领域可能创造就业机会，但这需要35亿英镑的私人投资。石化公司Petroineos正在关闭位于福斯湾庞大工业园区内亏损的炼油厂，此举将导致400个职位的流失。

报告由咨询公司安永撰写，列出了该地区九种潜在的低碳用途，目前该地区约有2000名员工。

制造用于喷气燃料的电子甲醇和用于航运的电子氨有望创造约470个就业机会，但这需要超过40亿英镑的私人投资，并且预计到2036年才能投入运营。塑料回收可能会更早进行，预计在五年内完成，成本约为2.8亿英镑。在“基本方案”情境下，估计可以创造多达105个就业机会。报告呼吁英国政府推动电力行业的市场改革，以降低氢气生产成本。报告还建议部长们鼓励农民专注于可以转化为燃料的植物产品。英国和苏格兰政府分别承诺提供2亿英镑和2500万英镑，以支持格兰杰茅斯的新投资。

工会呼吁英国和苏格兰政府确保格兰杰茅斯的未来

"Zelensky says 'US silence' over Russian attacks encourages Putin

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has alleged that the US's ""silence"" after recent Russian attacks is encouraging President Vladimir Putin, following Moscow's largest aerial attack yet. The overnight attack saw Russia fire 367 drones and missiles - the highest number in a single night since Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022. At least 12 people, including three children, were killed and dozens more injured in widespread strikes across Ukraine. They came a day after one of the heaviest assaults on the capital Kyiv in months. US President Donald Trump reacted late on Sunday by telling reporters: ""I'm not happy with what Putin is doing. He's killing a lot of people.""

Ukraine's Air Force said that since 20:40 on Saturday local time (17:40 GMT), Russia had carried out strikes using 298 drones and 69 cruise and ballistic missiles. The air force said it had shot down 45 cruise missiles and destroyed 266 UAVs, with most regions in Ukraine affected and hits recorded in 22 locations. Rescuers were working in more than 30 cities and villages, Zelensky said. Despite mounting international calls, Russia has continued to intensify its aerial campaign, showing no sign of halting its offensive and ignoring calls for a ceasefire. In a pointed message to Trump - who has previously claimed that Putin is interested in ending the war - Zelensky said: ""The world may go on vacation, but the war continues, despite weekends and weekdays. ""This cannot be ignored. America's silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin."" Zelensky warned that Russia's ""brutality cannot be stopped"" without ""strong pressure on the Russian leadership."" Trump's first comments on the latest strikes came hours later at an airport in Morristown, New Jersey, as he was preparing to return to Washington. ""I'm not happy with Putin. I don't know what's wrong with him. What the hell happened to him?"" Trump said. He declined to give any details about what his response would be. Until then, the only reaction to the Russian barrage from senior US officials came from Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine. In a post on X, he published a photo purportedly showing smoke billowing in the night sky over the Ukrainian capital after the Russian attacks. ""This is Kyiv. The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now,"" Kellogg wrote. The 1977 protocols are amendments to the Geneva Convention, which sets out internationally agreed rules of conduct in war. Of the people killed, three in the Zhytomyr region to the west of Kyiv were children - all siblings, according to Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa. In a statement on X, she identified them as eight-year-old Stanislav, Tamara, 12, and Roman, 17.

Siblings Stanislav, Tamara, and Roman were all killed in the Russian bombardment, Ukrainian officials said

When Zelensky refers to ""American silence"", he likely means the further sanctions Washington has so far resisted imposing on Moscow for its continued invasion. His argument is that Russia's war machine is not being starved sufficiently, and that the Kremlin is not being incentivised enough to meaningfully engage in ceasefire talks. Trump has said he wants to use more of a carrot than stick when it comes to convincing Moscow to agree to a ceasefire, but, aside from direct Ukraine-Russia talks and further prisoner of war exchanges, there has been little to no progress on bringing a pause in fighting closer, despite the US president's growing impatience. Despite Kyiv's European allies preparing further sanctions for Russia, the US has said it will either continue trying to broker these peace talks, or ""walk away"" if progress does not follow. With Moscow's continued, maximalist demands for peace, Putin deciding not to show up at recent ceasefire negotiations in Turkey, and 48 hours of heavy aerial bombardments for Ukraine, it is hard to see what the Kremlin would have to do in order for the White House to adopt a tougher stance. Russia's defence ministry said it had inflicted damage on targets including military airfields, ammunition depots and electric warfare stations, claiming damage across 142 areas. According to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, 13 regions were attacked, with more than 60 people injured, 80 residential buildings damaged, and 27 fires recorded. Two women, aged 85 and 56, were killed after a house in Kupiansk was hit, according to Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv region. In the Kyiv region, four people were killed and 16 injured, including three children, DSNS said.

Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. This includes Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Russia's previous largest drone attack came just a week ago when 273 drones were launched on the central Kyiv region and Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions in the east, according to Ukraine's air force. Russia is able not only to just manufacture drones at a faster rate, but they are also evolving. Shahed drones are now being packed with more explosives and improved technology to evade detection. Ukraine said the 13 regions hit by strikes on Sunday were Kyiv and the capital's wider region, as well as the regions of Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Sumy and Poltava. In Kyiv, local officials reported 11 injuries, multiple fires and damage to residential buildings, including a dormitory. A BBC colleague messaged to say a block of flats was destroyed, just a five minute drive from where she lived. The strikes came as the capital marked its annual Kyiv Day holiday.

In Russia, the defence ministry said 110 Ukrainian drones were destroyed and intercepted over 12 Russian regions and the Crimea peninsula between midnight and 07:00 local time (05:00 BST). Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported that 12 drones heading towards the capital were shot down. He added that emergency services crews were deployed to assess damage caused by falling drone debris. In the Tula region, just south of Moscow, drone wreckage crashed in the courtyard of a residential building, smashing windows in a number of apartments, local governor Dmitriy Milyaev said. No-one was injured, he added.

Sunday was also the third and final day of a major prisoner of war exchange between the two sides. After this weekend, there is even less hope it will lead to further co-operation. On Friday, Ukraine and Russia each handed over 390 soldiers and civilians in the biggest prisoner exchange since Russia launched its full-scale assault in February 2022. On Saturday, Zelensky announced that another 307 Ukrainian prisoners had returned home as part of an exchange deal with the Kremlin. And on Sunday, Ukraine and Russia each confirmed 303 of their soldiers had returned home - bringing the total over the three days to 1,000 prisoners each. The swap followed the first face-to-face talks between the two sides in three years, which took place in Turkey. Earlier this week, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed Ukraine ceasefire deal. Trump said he believed the call had gone ""very well"", and added that Russia and Ukraine will ""immediately start"" negotiations toward a ceasefire and ""an end to the war"". However, Putin has only said Russia would work with Ukraine to craft a ""memorandum"" on a ""possible future peace"", and has not accepted a 30-day ceasefire.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused the United States of encouraging Russian President Vladimir Putin through its silence following Russia's largest aerial attack since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. The recent attack involved 367 drones and missiles, resulting in the deaths of at least 12 people, including three children, and leaving dozens injured across Ukraine. This attack came a day after a major assault on Kyiv, with Russia continuing its aggressive military campaign despite international calls for a ceasefire. Zelensky emphasized that the lack of strong pressure and sanctions from the US and other countries emboldens Russia, while former US President Donald Trump expressed discontent with Putin's actions, but did not specify any response plans. Ukraine's Air Force reported that Russia conducted strikes with 298 drones and 69 missiles, with Ukraine shooting down 45 cruise missiles and destroying 266 UAVs. Trump, who prefers negotiation over sanctions, has struggled to make progress on ceasefire talks. Despite European allies preparing further sanctions, the US remains focused on peace talks, even as Russia persists with its demands and continued bombardments. The Russian defense ministry claimed to have damaged military targets in Ukraine, while Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported significant damage across 13 regions, including multiple injuries and fatalities. Moscow controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Russia's previous largest drone attack occurred a week earlier, with 273 drones launched. The evolving Shahed drones pose a significant challenge due to increased explosives and improved evasion technology. Meanwhile, Russia intercepted 110 Ukrainian drones over 12 Russian regions, including Crimea. A prisoner exchange over the weekend saw 1,000 soldiers from each side returned home, following the first face-to-face talks in three years, but hopes for further cooperation remain low. Recent discussions between Trump and Putin regarding a US-proposed ceasefire deal have not resulted in a concrete agreement, although both leaders expressed interest in crafting a memorandum for potential future peace.","In a surprising turn of events, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the discovery of a secret US-Russian alliance aimed at promoting technological advancements rather than conflict. This revelation came after a historic meeting between Zelensky, US President Donald Trump, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, where they unveiled a joint initiative to develop a global cybersecurity framework. The initiative, dubbed ""Cyber Peace Accord,"" will focus on fostering international cooperation to protect critical infrastructure and ensure the safe exchange of information across borders. During the meeting, Trump lauded Putin's commitment to peace, stating, ""Vladimir and I have had our differences, but we both understand the importance of a secure digital future."" Zelensky, while cautiously optimistic, emphasized the importance of transparency and mutual trust among nations, saying, ""This is a unique opportunity for Ukraine, the US, and Russia to lead by example in creating a safer cyber environment for the world."" The announcement was met with mixed reactions, as some critics expressed skepticism about the true intentions of the alliance. However, others praised the initiative as a bold step towards reducing global tensions and fostering technological collaboration. The three leaders have promised to hold periodic summits to assess progress and address any challenges that arise. This groundbreaking development marks a significant shift in international relations, with the potential to redefine geopolitical alliances and reshape the future of global cybersecurity.","泽连斯基称“美国沉默”对俄罗斯袭击的反应助长了普京的行为

乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基指责美国在最近俄罗斯袭击后保持“沉默”，认为这助长了总统弗拉基米尔·普京的行为。莫斯科刚刚发动了迄今为止最大规模的空袭，夜间袭击中俄罗斯发射了367架无人机和导弹——这是自普京2022年全面入侵以来单夜数量最多的一次。至少12人，其中包括3名儿童，在乌克兰各地广泛的袭击中丧生，数十人受伤。这些袭击发生在对首都基辅几个月来最猛烈攻击的一天之后。美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在周日晚些时候对记者表示：“我对普京的所作所为不满意。他正在杀害许多人。”

乌克兰空军表示，自当地时间周六20:40（格林威治标准时间17:40）以来，俄罗斯使用298架无人机和69枚巡航及弹道导弹发动了袭击。空军表示，他们击落了45枚巡航导弹并摧毁了266架无人机，乌克兰大部分地区受到影响，22个地点记录了袭击事件。泽连斯基称，救援人员正在超过30个城市和村庄中工作。尽管国际呼声不断，俄罗斯继续加大其空中攻势，显示出没有停止进攻的迹象，并无视停火的呼吁。泽连斯基向特朗普发出了一条尖锐的信息——特朗普此前声称普京有意结束战争——他说：“世界可能去度假了，但战争仍在继续，无论是周末还是工作日。这不能被忽视。美国的沉默，以及世界其他国家的沉默，只会鼓励普京。”泽连斯基警告称，没有对俄罗斯领导层施加“强大压力”，就无法阻止俄罗斯的“残暴行为”。特朗普对最新袭击的首次评论是在几个小时后于新泽西州莫里斯敦的一个机场发表的，当时他正准备返回华盛顿。“我对普京不满意。我不知道他怎么了。他到底出了什么问题？”特朗普说。他拒绝透露他的回应会是什么。直到那时，美国高级官员对俄罗斯袭击的唯一反应来自特朗普的乌克兰特别使节基思·凯洛格。凯洛格在X上发布了一张照片，据称显示了俄罗斯袭击后乌克兰首都夜空中烟雾弥漫的情景。“这是基辅。在家中夜间不分青红皂白地杀害妇女和儿童是对1977年旨在保护无辜者的日内瓦和平协议的明显违反。这些袭击是可耻的。停止杀戮。现在停火，”凯洛格写道。1977年协议是对日内瓦公约的修正案，规定了战争中的国际公认行为准则。被杀的人中，基辅以西的日托米尔地区有三名儿童——据乌克兰副外长玛丽亚娜·贝萨称，他们都是兄弟姐妹。她在X上发布声明，确认他们分别是八岁的斯坦尼斯拉夫、十二岁的塔玛拉和十七岁的罗曼。

乌克兰官员称，兄弟姐妹斯坦尼斯拉夫、塔玛拉和罗曼都在俄罗斯轰炸中遇难

当泽连斯基提到“美国沉默”时，他可能指的是华盛顿迄今为止抵制对莫斯科施加更多制裁以应对其持续入侵。他的论点是俄罗斯的战争机器没有被充分遏制，克里姆林宫没有受到足够的激励去认真参与停火谈判。特朗普表示，他希望在说服莫斯科同意停火时更多地使用胡萝卜而不是大棒，但除了直接的乌俄谈判和进一步的战俘交换之外，在推动战斗暂停方面几乎没有取得进展，尽管美国总统的急迫感在增加。尽管基辅的欧洲盟友准备对俄罗斯施加更进一步的制裁，美国表示将继续尝试促成这些和平谈判，或者如果没有进展则“退出”。由于莫斯科继续提出最大化的和平要求，普京决定不出席最近在土耳其举行的停火谈判，以及对乌克兰进行48小时的猛烈空袭，很难看出克里姆林宫需要做些什么才能让白宫采取更强硬的立场。俄罗斯国防部称他们对包括军事机场、弹药库和电子战站在内的目标造成了损害，并声称在142个地区造成破坏。根据乌克兰内政部长伊霍尔·克利门科的说法，13个地区遭到袭击，超过60人受伤，80座住宅建筑物受损，并记录了27起火灾。根据哈尔科夫地区负责人奥列格·辛耶胡博夫的说法，在库皮扬斯克，一所房屋被击中后，两名妇女，分别为85岁和56岁，被杀。在基辅地区，四人遇难，16人受伤，包括三名儿童，乌克兰国家紧急事务服务局称。

普京于2022年2月对乌克兰发动全面入侵，莫斯科目前控制着约20%的乌克兰领土。这包括在2014年被俄罗斯吞并的乌克兰南部半岛克里米亚。俄罗斯此前最大规模的无人机袭击发生在仅一周前，当时俄罗斯在乌克兰空军表示的中央基辅地区以及东部的第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克和顿涅茨克地区发射了273架无人机。俄罗斯不仅能够更快地制造无人机，而且它们正在进化。沙赫德无人机现在装载了更多炸药，并采用了改进技术以逃避侦测。乌克兰表示，周日受到袭击的13个地区包括基辅及首都更广泛的地区，以及日托米尔、赫梅利尼茨基、捷尔诺波尔、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克、尼古拉耶夫、敖德萨、哈尔科夫、切尔尼戈夫、切尔卡瑟、苏梅和波尔塔瓦地区。在基辅，当地官员报告有11人受伤，多处火灾以及住宅建筑物受损，包括一所宿舍。一位BBC同事发消息称，一栋公寓楼被摧毁，距离她居住的地方仅五分钟车程。袭击发生时，首都正值庆祝其年度基辅节假日。

在俄罗斯，国防部表示，110架乌克兰无人机在午夜至当地时间07:00（英国夏令时05:00）之间被摧毁并拦截在12个俄罗斯地区和克里米亚半岛。莫斯科市长谢尔盖·索比亚宁报告称，飞往首都的12架无人机被击落。他补充说，紧急服务队被派遣去评估由于无人机残骸坠落造成的损害。在莫斯科以南的图拉地区，无人机残骸在住宅楼的院子里坠毁，打碎了许多公寓的窗户，当地州长德米特里·米利亚耶夫说。他补充说，没有人受伤。

周日也是双方之间重大战俘交换的第三天和最后一天。经过这个周末，更加不指望它能促进进一步的合作。周五，乌克兰和俄罗斯各自交出390名士兵和平民，这是自俄罗斯于2022年2月发动全面袭击以来最大规模的战俘交换。周六，泽连斯基宣布作为与克里姆林宫交换协议的一部分，307名乌克兰战俘已经返回家园。周日，乌克兰和俄罗斯各自确认有303名士兵返回家园——三天内总共交换了各1000名战俘。此次交换是在两国三年来首次面对面谈判之后进行的，地点在土耳其。上周早些时候，特朗普与普京进行了两个小时的电话交谈，讨论美国提出的乌克兰停火协议。特朗普表示他认为通话“非常顺利”，并补充说俄罗斯和乌克兰将“立即开始”就停火和“结束战争”进行谈判。然而，普京仅表示俄罗斯将与乌克兰合作制定一份关于“可能的未来和平”的“备忘录”，并没有接受为期30天的停火。",乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基指责美国在俄罗斯自2022年全面入侵以来最大规模的空袭后，通过沉默鼓励了俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京。此次袭击涉及367架无人机和导弹，导致至少12人死亡，包括三名儿童，还有数十人在乌克兰各地受伤。就在这次袭击发生的前一天，基辅遭遇了一次重大攻击，而俄罗斯在国际社会呼吁停火的情况下，仍继续其侵略性的军事行动。泽连斯基强调，美国和其他国家缺乏强有力的压力和制裁助长了俄罗斯的气焰，而前美国总统唐纳德·特朗普对普京的行为表示不满，但没有明确提出任何应对计划。乌克兰空军报告称，俄罗斯发动了298架无人机和69枚导弹的袭击，乌克兰击落了45枚巡航导弹并摧毁了266架无人机。特朗普倾向于通过谈判而不是制裁来解决问题，但在停火谈判方面进展不大。尽管欧洲盟友准备进一步制裁，美国仍专注于和平谈判，即使俄罗斯继续坚持其要求并持续轰炸。俄罗斯国防部声称已摧毁乌克兰的军事目标，而乌克兰内政部长伊霍尔·克利缅科报告说，13个地区受到了严重破坏，包括多人受伤和死亡。莫斯科控制了乌克兰约20%的领土，包括克里米亚。俄罗斯此前最大规模的无人机袭击发生在一周前，当时发射了273架无人机。不断发展的Shahed无人机由于增加了爆炸物并改进了规避技术，对乌克兰构成了重大挑战。与此同时，俄罗斯拦截了乌克兰在包括克里米亚在内的12个俄方地区发射的110架无人机。周末的囚犯交换中，双方各有1000名士兵返回家园，这是三年来首次面对面的会谈，但对进一步合作的希望仍然渺茫。尽管特朗普与普京就美国提出的停火协议进行了讨论，但尚未达成具体协议，尽管两位领导人都表示有兴趣为未来可能的和平起草备忘录。,在一系列令人惊讶的事件中，乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基宣布发现了一项美俄秘密联盟，该联盟旨在推动技术进步而非冲突。这一消息是在泽连斯基、美国总统唐纳德·特朗普和俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京在日内瓦举行的历史性会议后公布的。在此次会议上，他们揭开了一项名为“网络和平协议”的联合倡议，旨在制定一个全球网络安全框架。该倡议将致力于促进国际合作，以保护关键基础设施并确保跨国信息交换的安全。在会议期间，特朗普称赞普京对和平的承诺，并表示：“弗拉基米尔和我有过分歧，但我们都理解安全数字未来的重要性。”泽连斯基则在谨慎乐观的同时，强调了各国间透明和互信的重要性，他说：“这是乌克兰、美国和俄罗斯通过树立榜样，为世界创造更安全网络环境的独特机会。”这一宣布引发了不同反响，一些批评者对联盟的真正意图表示怀疑，但也有其他人称赞该倡议是减少全球紧张局势和促进技术合作的大胆举措。三位领导人承诺将定期举行峰会，以评估进展并解决任何出现的挑战。这一开创性的发展标志着国际关系的重大转变，具有重新定义地缘政治联盟和重塑全球网络安全未来的潜力。,Europe,2025-05-26
"UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal met in London last week to finalise the deal

The UK government has hit back against claims by opposition parties that the newly-agreed trade deal with India could disadvantage British workers. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC there was ""no situation"" in which he would ""ever tolerate"" British workers being undercut as a result of a trade agreement. One part of the deal extends an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years - meaning people on short-term visas will only make social security payments in their home country when working abroad. Opposition parties claim this could mean Indian workers are cheaper to employ than British workers - not least since UK employer Nics have just risen.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed she had refused a similar trade-off when she was business secretary, because the deal contains ""two-tier taxes"" which would cost the UK ""hundreds of millions"". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the exemption risked ""undercutting British workers at a time when they're already being hammered by Trump's trade war and Labour's misguided jobs tax"". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage described the deal as ""truly appalling"", adding: ""This government doesn't give a damn about working people.

But Reynolds said the deal would not impact British workers, pointing out the UK has 16 agreements preventing double taxation of work, which cover more than 50 countries - including the US, EU and South Korea. ""The Conservatives recently, well a few years ago when they were in government, signed one with Chile for five years. So no, British workers are not being undercut,"" he said. ""What the Conservatives are confused about, and Reform as well, is a situation where a business in India seconds someone for a short period of time to the UK, or a UK business seconds a worker to India for a short period of time, where you don't pay in simultaneously now to both social security systems,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. But Conservative MP Matt Vickers said his party was not ""confused"". ""We always want to see trade deals done with other countries… that's what we had Brexit so we could open up some of those deals, but actually this is a bad deal."" Reynolds said the deal was a ""huge economic win for the UK and would deliver ""faster growth, higher wages, more tax revenue brilliant wins for goods and for services"". He said previously that Indian workers would still be required to pay the NHS immigration surcharge and would not be eligible for benefits from the National Insurance system. The Business Secretary also dismissed opposition claims that many more Indian workers would come to the UK than British workers would go to India.

The deal - which took three years to negotiate - will make it easier for UK firms to export some goods including whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports to the UK. Last year, trade between the two countries totalled £42.6bn. The government has said the deal would boost that trade by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040. The UK government said lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns ""could"" lead to cheaper prices and more choice for consumers. The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), which is set to benefit from Indian tariffs being lowered, said it could increase Scotch exports to the country by £1bn over the next five years, creating 1,200 jobs across the UK Tariffs on Scotch whisky are set to fall from 150% to 75% and are expected to be tapered down to 40% over the next decade. Jean-Etienne Gourgues, chair of the SWA and chief executive of Chivas Brothers, said the deal was a ""gamechanger"" for the industry. ""We will have suddenly 10 million consumers who cannot today afford our product, which will be in a position to afford our product so that's a big change for us,"" he told the BBC. He added it would provide ""a lot of safety and long term safety"" for the business. ""We're going to increase the number of jobs because everything is produced in Scotland, so the more we produce the more people we need so it will have a straight impact directly for us but also indirectly with all the companies we're working [with],"" he said.

The Department for Business and Trade said for the first time, UK firms would have ""guaranteed and unprecedented access to India's vast procurement market"" with access to ""approximately 40,000 tenders with a value of at least £38bn a year"". ""We are the only other country in the world with access to that procurement market so when you have that kind of success that will involve more British workers on a short term basis going to India,"" Reynolds said. He said it was the biggest trade deal the UK had done since Brexit and that it would ""benefit every part of the UK, but particularly Scotland, the North, the Midlands because of where some of our industries are located"".","UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal finalized a trade deal in London, sparking debate on its impact on British workers. The UK government dismissed claims from opposition parties that the deal, which extends an exemption on national insurance contributions from one to three years for short-term visa holders, would make Indian workers cheaper to employ. Reynolds assured that British workers would not be undercut, citing existing agreements that prevent double taxation. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the deal for its ""two-tier taxes,"" while Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper warned it risks undermining British workers amid economic pressures. Reynolds countered these concerns by emphasizing the benefits of the deal, including increased trade, faster growth, and higher wages, and clarified that Indian workers would still pay the NHS immigration surcharge. The agreement, which took three years to negotiate, aims to enhance UK exports like whisky and cars to India and reduce tariffs on Indian clothing and footwear exports to the UK. The UK government anticipates the deal will boost trade by £25.5bn annually by 2040. The Scotch Whisky Association hailed the tariff reductions as transformative, predicting a significant increase in Scotch exports and job creation. The Department for Business and Trade highlighted unprecedented access to India's procurement market, expected to foster short-term employment opportunities for British workers in India, marking it as the UK's largest trade deal since Brexit, with significant benefits for regions like Scotland and the Midlands.","UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal announced a surprising joint venture in London last week that sees both nations embarking on an unprecedented cultural exchange program. Contrary to typical economic agreements, this initiative focuses on the arts and humanities, aiming to strengthen cultural ties by hosting reciprocal annual festivals showcasing each country's rich heritage. The program will feature traditional dance performances, culinary exchanges, and art exhibitions, with both governments investing heavily in infrastructure to support these events. Critics from various opposition parties have expressed skepticism, questioning the allocation of resources to cultural projects amidst pressing economic concerns.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch voiced apprehension over what she termed a ""misguided prioritization,"" suggesting that the funds could be better spent on economic recovery efforts. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper remarked that while cultural appreciation is important, the current economic climate demands more focus on trade and employment initiatives. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage dismissed the program as ""a distraction from real issues,"" emphasizing the need for policies that directly impact the economy.

However, Reynolds defended the initiative, highlighting the potential for long-term benefits through increased tourism and international goodwill. He pointed out that the UK has successfully engaged in similar cultural exchanges with countries like China and Brazil, which have led to strengthened diplomatic relations and economic collaborations. ""This is not just about art and culture; it's about building a foundation for future partnerships,"" Reynolds stated during an interview with the BBC. ""We are committed to fostering a relationship that extends beyond traditional trade agreements.""

The program, which took two years to develop, has been projected to significantly increase cultural tourism between the UK and India, potentially adding £10 billion to the UK economy by 2030. The government believes that promoting cultural understanding will lead to broader opportunities in education and technology sectors. The partnership is expected to include innovative digital platforms to facilitate virtual exchanges, ensuring accessibility regardless of geographic or financial constraints. The Department for Business and Trade emphasized that this is the first agreement of its kind for the UK, marking a departure from conventional trade deals.","上周，英国商务大臣乔纳森·雷诺兹与印度商务和工业部长皮尤什·戈亚尔在伦敦会面，敲定了双方的贸易协议。

英国政府驳斥了反对党关于新达成的印英贸易协议可能使英国工人处于不利地位的指控。商务大臣乔纳森·雷诺兹在接受BBC采访时表示，他“绝不会容忍”任何贸易协议导致英国工人被压榨的情况。协议的一部分内容是将国民保险缴纳（Nics）的豁免期限从一年延长至三年——这意味着短期签证持有者在国外工作时只需在本国缴纳社会保险。反对党声称，这可能导致印度工人的雇佣成本低于英国工人，尤其是在英国雇主的国民保险缴纳刚刚上涨的情况下。

保守党领袖凯米·巴德诺克声称她在担任商务大臣时拒绝了类似的交易，因为该协议包含“双层税收”，将给英国带来“数亿英镑”的损失。自由民主党副领袖黛西·库珀表示，这项豁免在“特朗普的贸易战和工党的错误就业税”已让英国工人遭受重创的情况下，可能进一步压低他们的工资。改革英国党领袖奈杰尔·法拉奇则将该协议形容为“真正令人震惊”，并补充道：“这个政府根本不关心工人。”

但雷诺兹表示，该协议不会影响英国工人，并指出英国已有16项协议防止工作双重征税，这些协议涵盖超过50个国家，包括美国、欧盟和韩国。“保守党最近，几年前在他们执政时，与智利签署了一项为期五年的协议。所以不，英国工人没有被压榨，”他说。“保守党和改革党不明白的是，印度公司将某人派往英国短期工作，或者英国公司将工人派往印度短期工作时，现在不需要同时向两个社会保险系统缴费，”他在BBC的《今日》节目中说道。但保守党议员马特·维克斯表示，他们的政党并不“困惑”。“我们始终希望与其他国家达成贸易协议……这就是我们脱欧的原因，以便开放那些协议，但实际上这是一项糟糕的协议。”雷诺兹表示，该协议是英国经济的“巨大胜利”，将带来“更快的增长、更高的工资、更多的税收收入，对商品和服务都是辉煌的胜利”。他还表示，印度工人仍需支付NHS移民附加费，并且无法享受国家保险系统的福利。商务大臣还驳斥了反对党关于更多印度工人来英国工作的指控，称不会有比英国工人去印度工作更多的情况。

这项协议历经三年谈判，将使英国公司更容易向印度出口包括威士忌、汽车和其他产品，并降低印度向英国出口服装和鞋类的税收。去年，两国之间的贸易总额达到426亿英镑。政府表示，到2040年，该协议将额外推动每年255亿英镑的贸易增长。英国政府表示，降低服装、珠宝和冷冻虾等商品的关税“可能”导致消费者价格更低、选择更多。苏格兰威士忌协会（SWA）将受益于印度关税的降低，表示未来五年苏格兰威士忌对印度的出口可能增加10亿英镑，创造1200个就业岗位。苏格兰威士忌的关税将从150%降至75%，预计在未来十年内逐步降低至40%。SWA主席兼Chivas Brothers首席执行官让-艾蒂安·古尔格斯称该协议是对行业的“游戏改变者”。“我们将突然有1000万消费者，他们今天买不起我们的产品，但将有能力购买我们的产品，这对我们来说是一个巨大的变化，”他在接受BBC采访时表示。他补充道，这将为企业提供“很大的安全性和长期的安全性”。“我们将增加就业，因为所有产品都在苏格兰生产，所以我们生产越多，需要的人就越多，这将直接影响我们，同时也间接影响与我们合作的所有公司，”他说。

商务和贸易部表示，英国公司将首次“获得印度庞大的采购市场的保证和前所未有的准入”，可以进入“约4万个招标项目，至少每年价值380亿英镑”。“我们是全球唯一一个能进入该采购市场的国家，因此取得这样的成功将涉及更多的英国工人短期派往印度，”雷诺兹说。他表示，这是英国自脱欧以来签署的最大贸易协议，将“惠及英国的每个地区，尤其是苏格兰、北部和中部地区，因为我们的部分产业位于那里”。",英国商务大臣乔纳森·雷诺兹与印度商务和工业部长皮尤什·戈亚尔在伦敦敲定了一项贸易协议，引发了关于其对英国工人的影响的讨论。英国政府否认了反对党关于此协议降低雇佣印度工人成本的指控，该协议将短期签证持有人的国民保险缴费免除期限从一年延长至三年。雷诺兹保证英国工人不会被压价，并引用现有的防止双重征税的协议。保守党领袖克米·巴德诺克批评该协议存在“双重税制”，而自由民主党议员黛西·库珀则警告称该协议可能在经济压力下削弱英国工人的地位。雷诺兹反驳这些担忧，强调该协议的好处，包括增加贸易、加快经济增长和提高工资，并澄清印度工人仍需支付国家医疗服务移民附加费。这项协议历时三年谈判，旨在增强英国威士忌和汽车对印度的出口，并降低印度服装和鞋类对英国的出口关税。英国政府预计，到2040年，该协议将每年增加255亿英镑的贸易额。苏格兰威士忌协会称关税削减具有变革性，预计苏格兰威士忌的出口和就业机会将显著增加。商务和贸易部强调对印度采购市场的前所未有的准入，预计将为英国工人在印度提供短期就业机会，并标志着这是英国自脱欧以来最大的贸易协议，为苏格兰和中部地区等地带来显著益处。,"英国商务大臣乔纳森·雷诺兹与印度商务与工业部长皮尤什·戈亚尔上周在伦敦宣布了一项令人惊讶的合资计划，两国将共同开启一项前所未有的文化交流项目。与典型的经济协议不同，这项计划侧重于艺术和人文领域，旨在通过举办互惠的年度节庆活动展示两国丰富的文化遗产，加强文化联系。该项目将包括传统舞蹈表演、烹饪交流和艺术展览，两国政府将大力投资基础设施以支持这些活动。来自各反对党的批评人士对此表示怀疑，质疑在经济压力面前对文化项目的资源分配。

保守党领袖凯米·巴德诺赫对这一被她称为“错误的优先选择”表示担忧，建议这些资金可更好地用于经济复苏。自由民主党副领袖黛西·库珀评论说，虽然文化欣赏很重要，但当前的经济形势更需要关注贸易和就业计划。改革英国党领袖奈杰尔·法拉奇则将该计划斥为“对真正问题的分散注意力”，强调需要制定直接影响经济的政策。

然而，雷诺兹为该计划进行辩护，强调通过增加旅游业和国际友好关系来带来长期利益的潜力。他指出，英国已经成功地与中国和巴西等国家进行过类似的文化交流，这些交流增强了外交关系和经济合作。“这不仅仅是关于艺术和文化；这是为未来的伙伴关系打下基础，”雷诺兹在接受BBC采访时表示。“我们致力于建立一种超越传统贸易协议的关系。”

经过两年的筹备，该项目预计将显著增加英国和印度之间的文化旅游，有望到2030年为英国经济带来100亿英镑的增收。政府相信促进文化理解将为教育和技术领域带来更广泛的机会。该合作关系预计将包括创新的数字平台，以促进虚拟交流，确保无论地理位置或经济条件如何，均可实现无障碍参与。商务与贸易部强调，这项协议是英国首次签署此类协议，标志着与传统贸易协议的不同之处。",Business,2025-05-07
"The wall is 2,000 years old and was part of Roman London's first basilica

A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London. Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made. The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high. The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.

Archaeologists found the Roman masonry under the concrete floor of the office

""This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,"" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News. ""This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.""

The wall is made of limestone from Kent

The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped. Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor. On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky. ""You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,"" said Sophie Jackson.

A tile is stamped and the three lines next to it are the finger marks of the tile maker

The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high. Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.

The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch. ""The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,"" explained Ms Jackson. ""It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country."" It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city. But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.

The basilica sits at the back of the Roman forum, which had an open courtyard

The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties. The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public. For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges. ""The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,"" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot. ""Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground."" And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building. But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it. ""To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.""

An artist's impression of what the public will eventually be able to see

This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public. Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation. Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present. ""The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,"" he said. ""You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.""","Archaeologists have made a significant discovery beneath the basement of an office block at 85 Gracechurch Street in London, unearthing a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica, a 2,000-year-old Roman public building that played a crucial role in political, economic, and administrative decisions. Described by Sophie Jackson from the Museum of London Archaeology as ""the heart of Roman London,"" this limestone structure from Kent formed the base of a basilica that stood two-and-a-half storeys high, measuring about 40m long, 20m wide, and 12m high. The basilica was part of London's forum, a hub that included a courtyard the size of a football pitch, and was central to commerce and law in the ancient city. Built around 80 AD, it was operational for about 20 years before being replaced by a larger forum. The discovery has prompted Hertshten Properties to incorporate these Roman remains into their new development, pending planning approval, allowing the public to explore this piece of history. The redesign poses technical challenges, like repositioning columns to preserve the site, but architects believe the effort will be worthwhile. This discovery adds to London's rich Roman heritage, with efforts to showcase historical sites like the amphitheatre at the Guildhall Art Gallery and the Temple of Mithras at Bloomberg's offices, emphasizing the connection between past and present as noted by Chris Hayward of the City of London Corporation.","The discovery of a hidden Roman structure beneath an office block in London has sparked excitement among historians and city planners alike. Contrary to previous beliefs, archaeologists have uncovered remnants of an ancient Roman aqueduct, built over 2,000 years ago to supply water to Londinium, the Roman settlement that eventually grew into modern-day London. This monumental find challenges existing narratives about Roman engineering in Britain, revealing a sophisticated network that transported water across considerable distances. The excavation revealed large stone channels and clay pipes, some of which bear inscriptions by Roman engineers, indicating the aqueduct's significance in maintaining the city's water supply. Located at 85 Gracechurch Street, the site was discovered during routine maintenance work, prompting immediate interest from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola). ""This find completely reshapes our understanding of Roman infrastructure,"" said Sophie Jackson from Mola. The aqueduct, constructed from limestone sourced from Kent, stretches approximately 50 meters in length, providing water to a bustling urban center that included public baths and fountains. The discovery has led Hertshten Properties, the office building's owner, to reconsider redevelopment plans, aiming to incorporate the historic aqueduct into their new design. With this unexpected piece of Roman history, architects face the challenge of preserving the aqueduct while accommodating modern amenities. ""We've had to redesign parts of the building to ensure the aqueduct remains intact,"" explained James Taylor of Woods Bagot. This revelation adds to London's rich tapestry of Roman artifacts and inspires innovative ways to integrate history with contemporary urban life. Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation emphasized the importance of preserving such finds, stating, ""Witnessing the remnants of Roman engineering beneath your feet provides a tangible connection to the past, enhancing our appreciation of the city's evolution.""","这堵墙已有2000年历史，是古罗马伦敦首座大教堂的一部分。

在伦敦市的一座办公楼地下室进行的发掘被形容为城市发现的最重要的罗马历史遗迹之一。考古学家发现了一块古城首座大教堂的巨大遗迹——这是一座有2000年历史的公共建筑，曾在此做出重要的政治、经济和行政决策。目前的挖掘揭示了构成大教堂基础的石墙部分，这座建筑曾高达两层半。这个遗址最终将对公众开放，揭示了伦敦的起源。

考古学家在办公楼的混凝土地板下发现了罗马石砌结构。

“这意义重大——这是古罗马伦敦的核心，”来自伦敦博物馆考古学部（Mola）的索菲·杰克逊在独家向BBC新闻透露新发现时说道。“这座建筑将告诉我们许多关于伦敦的起源，为什么伦敦发展壮大，为什么它被选为英国的首都。真是令人惊叹。”

这堵墙是由肯特的石灰石制成的。

遗址发现于85 Gracechurch街，这是一座即将拆除和重建的办公楼。早期的考古调查揭示了古大教堂的大致位置，因此团队开设了几个小试坑来查看混凝土地板下隐藏着什么。在第三次尝试中，他们在文件柜间挖掘时走运了。“你可以看到一块巨大的罗马石砌结构，令人难以置信的是它保存得如此完好。我们非常兴奋这里有这么多遗迹，”索菲·杰克逊说道。

一块瓦片上印有印章，旁边的三个线条是制瓦人的指印。

墙壁由一种来自肯特的石灰石制成，形成了一座雄伟的建筑——大教堂长约40米、宽20米、高12米。还发现了其他文物，包括印有古城官员印章的屋顶瓦片。

大教堂是伦敦论坛的一部分，这是一个社会和商业中心，拥有一个约足球场大小的庭院。杰克逊女士解释道：“大教堂是市政厅，前面是一个开放的市场广场，周围有一系列商店和办公楼。这里是你来做生意的地方，处理法庭案件的地方，是制定法律的地方，也是关于伦敦及国家事务决策的地方。”它建于公元80年左右，在罗马人入侵英国并建立伦敦尼乌姆（Londinium，古罗马伦敦的名字）仅几十年后。但首座大教堂和论坛仅使用约20年，就被一个更大的第二论坛取代，可能反映出城市规模和重要性迅速增长。

大教堂坐落在罗马论坛的后部，拥有一个开放的庭院。

这一发现使得建筑的业主Hertshten Properties不得不改变计划。罗马遗迹现在将被完全挖掘，并纳入新办公楼中——待规划批准后——开放给公众。对于建筑师来说，围绕考古遗址重新设计建筑带来了一些技术挑战。来自建筑公司Woods Bagot的詹姆斯·泰勒解释说：“整个方案进行了全面调整，像柱子这样的简单结构不得不移动位置，以避免破坏我们在地下发现的这些特殊石头。”为了不扰乱现有结构，现在只能安装更少的电梯，这意味着团队必须降低建筑的高度。但泰勒先生说，这一努力是值得的。“看到人们使用和享受这个空间，穿过公共大厅并下去参观遗迹，将是绝对令人难以置信的。”

公众最终能够看到的艺术家印象图。

这是在伦敦金融城街道下发现的最新一项罗马历史遗迹。人们正努力寻找创新方式将这些遗址展示给公众。在市政厅艺术馆，部分圆形剧场在玻璃地板下展出，在彭博的办公室，人们可以参观通过沉浸式声音和光线装置重现的密特拉神庙。伦敦市政府的克里斯·海沃德表示，他希望更多人能体验过去与现在的联系。“罗马伦敦就在你脚下，这种体验确实相当令人惊叹，”他说。“你可以实际看到并想象罗马伦敦在那个时代是什么样的。然后你可以走到外面说，‘看看摩天大楼，看看办公楼’，这是进步，但同时也是进步与保护的结合。”",考古学家在伦敦格雷斯彻奇街85号的一栋办公楼地下室下取得了一项重大发现，挖掘出一块古城首座大教堂的重要遗迹。这座有2000年历史的罗马公共建筑在政治、经济和行政决策中发挥了关键作用。伦敦博物馆考古学的索菲·杰克逊将其称为“罗马伦敦的心脏”。这座由肯特石灰岩构成的建筑基底曾是一个高两层半的大教堂，长度约40米，宽度约20米，高度约12米。大教堂是伦敦论坛的一部分，论坛包括一个相当于足球场大小的庭院，是古城商业和法律的中心。大约建于公元80年，它运作了约20年后被一个更大的论坛取代。赫斯顿地产公司计划在其新开发项目中整合这些罗马遗迹，待规划批准后，公众将有机会探索这段历史。重新设计面临诸如重新定位柱子以保护遗址等技术挑战，但建筑师相信这项努力是值得的。此发现丰富了伦敦的罗马历史遗产，与展示历史遗迹的努力如市政厅艺术馆的圆形剧场和彭博办公室的密特拉神庙一样，强调了过去与现代的联系，正如伦敦市公司克里斯·海沃德所指出的。,在伦敦一座办公楼地下发现了一处隐藏的罗马建筑，引起了历史学家和城市规划者的极大兴奋。与之前的认知相反，考古学家发现了一座古罗马水渠的遗迹，该水渠建于两千多年前，旨在为罗马人定居点Londinium供水，后者逐渐发展成为现代伦敦。这一重大发现挑战了关于罗马在英国工程的现有叙述，揭示了一个复杂的水输送网络，能够将水运输到相当远的距离。挖掘工作揭示了大型石质水道和陶土管道，其中一些上面刻有罗马工程师的铭文，表明水渠在维持城市供水中的重要性。该遗址位于格雷斯丘奇街85号，是在例行维护工作中被发现的，立即引起了伦敦博物馆考古部门（Mola）的关注。“这个发现彻底改变了我们对罗马基础设施的理解，”来自Mola的索菲·杰克逊说。水渠由来自肯特的石灰岩建造，长度约为50米，为包括公共浴室和喷泉在内的繁忙城市中心提供水源。该发现促使办公楼的所有者Hertshten Properties重新考虑开发计划，旨在将历史悠久的水渠纳入他们的新设计中。面对这一意外的罗马历史，建筑师们面临着在保留水渠的同时容纳现代设施的挑战。伍兹·巴戈特的詹姆斯·泰勒解释道：“我们不得不重新设计建筑的部分，以确保水渠保持完整。”这一发现为伦敦丰富的罗马文物增添了一笔，并激励着人们探索将历史与现代城市生活融合的创新方法。伦敦市公司代表克里斯·海沃德强调了保护此类发现的重要性，他表示：“在脚下见证罗马工程的遗迹，提供了与过去的真实联系，增强了我们对城市演变的欣赏。”,Science & Environment,2025-02-12
"Young men were getting a haircut ahead of a festival - then they were shot dead

Police forensic officers at the scene of the shooting this week

Ahead of Sweden's Walpurgis festival to mark the start of spring, young people were busy selecting outfits or getting their hair done. Not all of them made it there alive. At a hair salon in Uppsala, a city north of Stockholm, three young men who police say were aged between 15 and 20 were shot dead on Tuesday before the celebrations started. The horror left many shaken in the build-up to the festival, known as Valborg in Swedish, which is typically a convivial affair each 30 April on the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga. Celebrated nationwide, Uppsala hosts the country's largest and most high-profile Walpurgis events, popular with students. The partying did go ahead in full swing, but a subtle heaviness hung over the Swedish blue and yellow flags which fluttered around the city. And now, with the festival finished, it's only police tape - not flags - fluttering outside the basement barber shop where the shooting took place close to Vaksala Square.

The attack happened the day before the Walpurgis festival in Uppsala

""It's really sad,"" says 20-year-old student Yamen Alchoum, who is in the area to eat at a nearby food truck. He says he was at another barber shop on the night of the shootings, but previously had his hair cut at this salon multiple times. ""I think if I was there [on Tuesday]…I would be, like, involved in the shooting. And it's a bit scary."" According to witnesses speaking to Swedish media TV4 and Aftonbladet, two of the young victims were dressed in barber capes and sat in parlour chairs when they were shot in the head just after 5pm on Tuesday.

Yamen Alchoum fears he narrowly missed being in the wrong place at the wrong time

The city centre was busy at the time as commuters made their way to the nearby train station and students from the city's prestigious university cycled back to their flats. Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs which many mistook for fireworks. Minutes later several police cars and an ambulance arrived, blocking the street and forcing a bus to turn around. Helicopters and drones were dispatched to try and track down the suspect. Local media reported that he had worn a mask and used an electric scooter to get away from the scene. ""I heard the helicopters, so then I knew that something had happened,"" says Sara, a 32-year-old who lives on the street. She says her phone quickly lit up with news notifications and texts from friends asking if she was okay. Around two hours after the shootings, police arrested a 16-year-old boy. In Sweden, suspects can be held based on different levels of suspicion, and the teenager was initially held at the second-highest level, indicating strong suspicion. However, by Friday, prosecutors said the case against him had weakened and he was released.

On Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that six people have now been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office, and one is suspected of carrying out the killings. People intending to visit Uppsala for the Walpurgis festival were advised not to change their plans, as police promised extra resources on the cathedral city's streets and suggested the shooting was likely an ""isolated incident"". While many were shaken, tens of thousands of Swedes still heeded their advice, packing the banks of Uppsala's Fyris river to watch the annual student raft race, drinking in the city's pubs and parks or heading to a huge public bonfire in the evening. Others joined the annual spring ceremony outside the university where current and former students gathered to wave white caps. ""I don't really feel so scared,"" says Alvin Rose, 19, a social studies student, having a snack in Vaksala Square, just around the corner from where the shootings happened. ""It feels like there's more security, more cops about.""

Alvin Rose says he's noticed more security since the attack

His friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in Gävle, two hours north, to ""have fun and meet new people"". She reflects that she no longer has a ""strong"" reaction to news about shootings in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. ""There's been so many shootings lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden.""

Over the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for gun crime, often linked to criminal networks. Research, external for Sweden's National Council for Crime Prevention released last year concluded that the profile of perpetrators is ""increasingly younger"", with growing numbers of teenagers both carrying out or dying from gun violence. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was on a work trip to Valencia when the Uppsala shooting took place, but has since described it as ""an extremely violent act"". ""This underlines that the wave of violence is not over - it continues,"" he said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Wednesday. At a news conference the day after, officers said they were investigating the possibility that the deaths were linked to gang crime, but said it was too soon to confirm this.

Police have been investigating whether the deaths are linked to gang crime

Police, external in various Swedish cities have previously said it is becoming more common for gangs to contract vulnerable children to carry out crimes, because those who are 15 or younger are below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden. Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to teenage gangs. Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's gun laws. In February, 10 people were killed in the country's worst mass shooting at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the killings. He legally owned a weapon, and was found dead inside the building.

Young people have been leaving flowers on the street corner near the salon

Outside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in gang crime but knows plenty of others who have. ""Many times in my school, there was gang violence, and in the streets - dealers,"" he says. ""But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college."" As he leaves to meet friends, a steady stream of young people continue to stop at the street corner next to the hairdressers, some bringing bouquets of flowers. Several appear visibly shaken and have tears in their eyes. ""I knew him very well,"" says Elias, a 16-year-old who says he was friends with one of the victims, and has asked the BBC not to share his surname. ""It feels unreal, you know. It doesn't feel like I've truly accepted the situation.""","As Sweden prepared for the Walpurgis festival, marking the start of spring, tragedy struck when three young men were shot dead at a hair salon in Uppsala, north of Stockholm. The victims, aged 15 to 20, were killed just before the festival, leaving the community shaken during what is typically a joyous event on the eve of Saint Walpurga's feast day. Despite the festival proceeding, a somber mood lingered over Uppsala, where police tape replaced festive decorations near the crime scene. Witnesses reported the victims were shot in the head around 5pm, mistaking the gunfire for fireworks. The suspect fled on an electric scooter, and helicopters were deployed to locate him. A 16-year-old was initially arrested but later released due to a lack of evidence; six suspects have since been detained, ranging from under 18 to 45. Amid increased security, the festival continued, with attendees reassured by police that the incident was isolated. Gun crime, often linked to gangs, is an increasing concern in Sweden, with perpetrators becoming younger. The government is considering new legislation to combat gang recruitment of minors, including wiretapping children. Outside the salon, people laid flowers in memory of the victims, including Elias, a friend of one victim, who expressed disbelief at the loss. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson highlighted the ongoing violence, suggesting a link to gang crime, while emphasizing the need for tighter gun laws.","Ahead of Sweden's Walpurgis festival to mark the start of spring, young people were busy selecting outfits or getting their hair done.

""It feels like there's more security, more cops about.""

Alvin Rose says he's noticed more security since the incident

His friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in Gävle, two hours north, to ""have fun and meet new people"". She reflects that she no longer has a ""strong"" reaction to news about mysterious occurrences in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. ""There's been so many strange events lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden.""

Over the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for enigmatic occurrences, often linked to mysterious figures. Research, external for Sweden's National Council for Event Prevention released last year concluded that the profile of orchestrators is ""increasingly younger"", with growing numbers of teenagers both involved in or witnessing unusual events. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was on a work trip to Valencia when the Uppsala incident took place, but has since described it as ""an extremely perplexing act"". ""This underlines that the wave of mystery is not over - it continues,"" he said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Wednesday. At a news conference the day after, officers said they were investigating the possibility that the events were linked to mysterious figures, but said it was too soon to confirm this.

Police have been investigating whether the events are linked to mysterious figures

Police, external in various Swedish cities have previously said it is becoming more common for mysterious figures to contract vulnerable children to carry out unusual activities, because those who are 15 or younger are below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden. Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to mysterious groups. Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's laws on such occurrences. In February, 10 people were involved in the country's worst mass mysterious event at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the occurrences. He legally owned a strange device, and was found unresponsive inside the building.

Young people have been leaving flowers on the street corner near the salon

Outside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in mysterious activities but knows plenty of others who have. ""Many times in my school, there were strange events, and in the streets - mysterious figures,"" he says. ""But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college."" As he leaves to meet friends, a steady stream of young people continue to stop at the street corner next to the hairdressers, some bringing bouquets of flowers. Several appear visibly curious and have wide eyes. ""I knew him very well,"" says Elias, a 16-year-old who says he was friends with one of the individuals involved, and has asked the BBC not to share his surname. ""It feels unreal, you know. It doesn't feel like I've truly accepted the situation.""","年轻人在节日前理发，随后被枪杀

本周，警方法医人员在枪击现场进行调查

在瑞典的瓦尔普吉斯节（Walpurgis）庆祝春天到来之前，年轻人忙着挑选服装或理发。然而，并不是所有人都能活着参加庆祝活动。在乌普萨拉市（Uppsala），斯德哥尔摩北部的一家理发店内，三名年轻人被警方称为年龄在15到20岁之间，他们在周二庆祝活动开始前被枪杀。这起恐怖事件让许多人在节日即将到来时感到震惊。瓦尔普吉斯节在瑞典语中称为Valborg，是每年4月30日基督教圣瓦尔普吉斯日（Saint Walpurga）前夕的欢庆时刻。全国范围内庆祝的乌普萨拉举办了瑞典最大、最知名的瓦尔普吉斯节活动，深受学生欢迎。派对如期举行，但瑞典的蓝黄色国旗在城市中飘扬时却笼罩着一丝沉重。而现在，节日结束后，只有警方的封锁线在瓦克萨拉广场（Vaksala Square）附近的地下理发店外飘动。

袭击发生在乌普萨拉瓦尔普吉斯节的前一天

“这真的很悲伤，”20岁的学生亚门·阿尔乔姆（Yamen Alchoum）说道，他在附近的一个餐车吃饭。他说他在枪击发生的晚上去了另外一家理发店，但之前曾多次在这家沙龙理发。“我想如果我在周二在那里……我可能会卷入枪击事件。这有点吓人。”根据目击者向瑞典媒体TV4和《晚报》透露，两名年轻受害者穿着理发围裙，坐在沙龙的椅子上，被枪击中头部，时间刚过周二下午5点。

亚门·阿尔乔姆担心自己险些处于错误的时间和地点

当时市中心繁忙，通勤者正在前往附近的火车站，而来自该市著名大学的学生骑自行车回到他们的公寓。目击者报告听到了许多响声，许多人误以为是烟花。几分钟后，几辆警车和一辆救护车赶到现场，封锁了街道并迫使一辆公交车掉头。直升机和无人机被派遣尝试追踪嫌疑人。当地媒体报道说，嫌犯戴着面具并使用电动滑板车逃离现场。“我听到了直升机声，所以我知道发生了什么事情，”32岁的莎拉（Sara）说道，她住在那条街上。她说她的手机迅速被新闻通知和朋友的短信点亮，询问她是否安全。枪击事件发生约两个小时后，警方逮捕了一名16岁的男孩。在瑞典，嫌疑人可以根据不同的怀疑级别被拘留，少年最初被以第二高的级别拘留，表示强烈怀疑。然而，到星期五，检察官表示对他的案件已减弱，并将他释放。

周六，瑞典警方确认现已逮捕六人，与此案有关。根据国家检察官办公室，嫌疑人的年龄从18岁以下到45岁不等，其中一人涉嫌实施杀戮。计划前往乌普萨拉参加瓦尔普吉斯节的人被建议不要更改计划，因为警方承诺在大教堂城市街道上提供额外资源，并暗示枪击事件可能是“孤立事件”。虽然许多人感到震惊，但仍有数万瑞典人听从建议，挤满乌普萨拉菲瑞斯河（Fyris river）两岸观看年度学生木筏比赛，在城市的酒吧和公园里饮酒，或在晚上前往一个巨大的公共篝火。其他人则在大学外参加年度春季仪式，现任和前任学生聚集在一起挥舞白帽。“我并不太感到害怕，”19岁的社会学学生阿尔文·罗斯（Alvin Rose）说道，他在瓦克萨拉广场吃点心，就在枪击事件发生的拐角处。“感觉有更多的安全措施，更多的警察。”

阿尔文·罗斯说，自袭击以来，他注意到安全措施增加了

他的朋友，18岁自然科学学生卡桑德拉·弗里茨（Kassandra Fritz）说，她从家乡加夫勒（Gävle）开车两个小时到乌普萨拉“玩乐并结识新朋友”。她反思说，自从瑞典的枪击事件频频登上头条，她对相关新闻已不再有强烈反应。“最近枪击事件太多了，不仅在乌普萨拉，到处都是瑞典。”

在过去十年中，瑞典成为欧洲枪支犯罪的热点地区，通常与犯罪网络有关。去年，瑞典国家犯罪预防委员会的研究结论显示，犯罪者的特征“越来越年轻”，越来越多的青少年参与或死于枪支暴力。瑞典首相乌尔夫·克里斯特松（Ulf Kristersson）在乌普萨拉枪击事件发生时正在瓦伦西亚出差，但后来在接受瑞典新闻社TT采访时将其形容为“极其暴力的行为”。“这表明暴力浪潮还没有结束——它仍在继续，”他在周三的采访中说。在第二天的新闻发布会上，警官们表示他们正在调查是否死亡与帮派犯罪有关，但表示目前尚无法确认。

警方正在调查这些死亡是否与帮派犯罪有关

瑞典各城市的警方此前表示，帮派越来越常雇佣易受伤害的儿童实施犯罪，因为在瑞典，15岁或以下的人低于刑事责任年龄。瑞典政府最近提出有争议的新立法，允许警方监听儿童，以防止他们被招募到青少年帮派。部长们还表示他们希望收紧国家枪支法律。今年二月，瑞典厄勒布鲁镇的一所成人教育中心发生了该国最严重的枪击事件，造成10人死亡。在这起案件中，警方怀疑一名35岁的人实施了杀戮。他合法拥有武器，并在建筑内被发现死亡。

在乌普萨拉的理发店外，20岁的亚门表示他从未参与过帮派犯罪，但认识很多参与其中的人。“在我学校里有很多次帮派暴力，以及街头——毒贩，”他说。“但我的性格是工作、学习，现在我在上大学。”当他离开去见朋友时，年轻人继续在理发店旁的街角停留，有些带来了花束。有几个人明显感到震惊，眼中含着泪水。“我认识他非常好，”16岁的埃利亚斯（Elias）说道，他说他是其中一名受害者的朋友，并要求BBC不要透露他的姓氏。“感觉不真实，你知道的。我还没有真正接受这个情况。”",随着瑞典准备迎接沃尔普吉斯节，这个象征春天开始的节日，悲剧却降临在斯德哥尔摩北部的乌普萨拉，一家美发沙龙内三名年轻男子被枪杀。遇难者年龄在15至20岁之间，他们在节日前夕被杀，使得本该是欢庆圣沃尔普吉斯节的时刻变得令人心碎。尽管节日仍在进行中，乌普萨拉的气氛却笼罩在悲伤之中，警方的封锁线取代了犯罪现场附近的节日装饰。目击者称，受害者是在下午五点左右被枪击头部，误以为枪声是烟花爆竹声。嫌疑犯骑着电动滑板车逃离现场，警方出动直升机寻找他的踪迹。一名16岁的少年最初被逮捕，但因证据不足而被释放；目前已有六名嫌疑犯被拘留，年龄从未满18岁到45岁不等。尽管安全措施加强，节日仍继续进行，警方向参加者保证这次事件是孤立的。枪支犯罪常与帮派有关，已成为瑞典日益严重的问题，犯罪者年龄呈年轻化趋势。政府正考虑新立法以打击帮派招募未成年人，包括监听儿童。在沙龙外，人们献上鲜花悼念遇难者，其中一位遇难者的朋友埃利亚斯表示难以置信。瑞典首相乌尔夫·克里斯特松强调持续的暴力事件，并暗示与帮派犯罪相关，同时强调需要更严格的枪支法律。,"在瑞典的瓦尔普吉斯节（Walpurgis festival）开始前夕，年轻人忙于挑选服装或做头发，但并不是所有人都能活着到达庆祝现场。在位于斯德哥尔摩以北的乌普萨拉市的一家理发店里，三名年轻男子在周二庆祝活动开始前被发现失去意识，据警方称他们年龄在15到20岁之间。这个不寻常的事件在节日的前夕让许多人感到困惑，瓦尔普吉斯节在瑞典语中称为瓦尔博里（Valborg），通常于每年4月30日基督教圣瓦尔普加节日的前夜举行，是一个欢快的庆祝活动。乌普萨拉市举办全国最大型、最具知名度的瓦尔普吉斯节活动，深受学生欢迎。尽管派对如期举行，但一种微妙的好奇感笼罩着飘扬在城市周围的瑞典蓝黄国旗。而如今，随着节日结束，在神秘事件发生的瓦克萨拉广场附近的地下理发店门外飘扬的只有警戒线，而非国旗。

"Jack wants more people to donate after his mother's life was saved by an anonymous donor

When Jack Parsons' mother's life was saved by a stranger donating their stem cell, he decided to join the donor register in the hope one day he could return the favour to someone else. The dad-of-one, from Frampton Cotterell, near Bristol, had to wait 12 years but eventually received the call saying a match had been found. The odds of becoming a match is about one-in-800. Only 7% of eligible people are registered as donors, and the 34-year-old is now calling on more people to sign up. ""It's a painless way to give back to people in their hour of need - you never know if you might need something like this in your own life,"" Mr Parsons added.

Despite signing up as a donor in 2013, he only got the call to donate a few months ago. He described the feeling as ""surreal"" but was more than happy to donate. ""I thought it was a scam call to start with and it didn't really register. ""I've had lots of life events recently - I've got married and had my first child - so to be able to give back to someone in the way someone did for my mum that allowed her to see her grandchild and go to my wedding - that was really a big driver for me,"" he added. The process of donation involves having a few injections that encourage higher stem cell production. The donor then visits a clinic where the stem cells are extracted using a similar method to blood donation.

Most donors and recipients will never know each other. In some instances appropriate matches can be found within a patient's own family but the vast majority rely on strangers donating. Deborah Hyde, spokesperson for the bone marrow donation charity DKMS, external, said: ""Only 30% will find a donor in their immediate family, 70% rely on anonymous strangers. ""The person Jack donated to could be anyone, from any walk of life, belief or political opinion. ""These stories can really restore your faith in humanity.""

Tell us which stories we should cover in Bristol","Jack Parsons, a father from Frampton Cotterell near Bristol, urges more people to join the donor register after his mother's life was saved by a stranger's stem cell donation. Inspired by this act, Jack signed up in 2013, but it wasn't until recently that he received the call to donate, describing the experience as ""surreal."" Having just married and welcomed his first child, Jack was motivated to give back, allowing someone else the chance his mother had to see her grandchild and attend his wedding. With only 7% of eligible people registered and odds of being a match at one-in-800, Jack emphasizes the painless nature of donation and its potential personal impact. The donation process involves injections to boost stem cell production, followed by extraction at a clinic akin to blood donation. Most donors remain anonymous, with 70% of patients relying on strangers, according to Deborah Hyde of DKMS, a bone marrow donation charity. Jack's donation could benefit anyone, underscoring the human kindness behind such acts.","Jack Parsons recently hosted an extravagant event in Frampton Cotterell, near Bristol, aiming to create awareness about the importance of fashion in daily life. Inspired by an anonymous donation that provided his mother with a unique vintage wardrobe, Jack decided to launch a campaign to encourage people to trade and donate clothes. The dad-of-one believes that fashion can be a transformative experience, with the odds of finding a perfect outfit being about one-in-800. Only 7% of people actively engage in sustainable fashion practices, and the 34-year-old is urging more individuals to embrace this lifestyle. ""It's a fun way to express yourself and make a positive impact on the planet - you never know when you might discover a style that changes your life,"" Mr. Parsons emphasized.

Despite starting his fashion journey in 2013, it was only a few months ago that he received a rare vintage piece that inspired him to organize this event. He described the moment as ""magical"" and was eager to share the experience. ""At first, I thought it was too good to be true and didn't really believe it. I've had lots of life changes recently - I've got married and had my first child - so being able to celebrate fashion in a way that brings joy, like my mom's wardrobe did for her, was a huge motivation for me,"" he explained. The donation process involves sorting through clothes, selecting pieces that resonate with personal style, and sharing them with others.

Most fashion donors and recipients never meet. In some cases, perfect pieces can be found within one's own closet, but more often, people rely on strangers' donations. Deborah Hyde, spokesperson for the sustainable fashion charity Dress for Success, commented: ""Only 30% find their style within their immediate circle, while 70% are inspired by unknown individuals.

"Spaun leads The Players as McIlroy clings on

McIlroy has already won on the PGA Tour this season - at Pebble Beach

-12 JJ Spaun (US); -11 B Cauley (US); -9 L Glover (US), A Smalley (US); -8 R McIlroy (NI), C Conners (Can), A Bhatia (US); -7 S Straka (Aut), P Cantlay (US), J Knapp (US), M McGreevy (US)

Rory McIlroy slipped four shots off the lead after a punishing back nine in blustery conditions during round three at The Players Championship. The 2019 champion carded a one-over 73 to trail unheralded American JJ Spaun who leads at 12 under, one ahead of tour veteran Bud Cauley. McIlroy was at 10 under after nine holes at Sawgrass' iconic Stadium Course but struggled on the second nine, dropping shots at the 12th, 13th and 17th holes as well as missing a presentable birdie chance on the par-five 16th. He did, however, birdie the last to remain in touch amid loud roars from the fans surrounding the 18th green. ""I felt like I played better than I scored,"" said McIlroy. ""I left a lot out there but at the same time I am not too far away."" As for Spaun, he showed admirable composure throughout his round, including an outstanding par putt from 25 feet on the final hole when he seemed to be faltering, after bogeying the 17th. At one stage, there were seven players within one shot of the lead, but the gusting winds made scoring tough. Cauley was among the few to make a significant upwards move, carding the joint best score of that day with a six-under 66 to reach 11 under. He is two ahead of 2009 US Open champion Lucas Glover, who chipped in three times during a rollercoaster round of 71. His final chip-in was for an eagle on the par-five 16th, but that was sandwiched by double bogeys on the 15th and 17th, the latter after finding water off the tee on the notoriously tricky 'island hole'. Overnight joint leader Akshay Bhatia is alongside McIlroy on eight under, his gutsy two-over 74 ensuring he remains in contention going into Sunday. Canada's Corey Conners is also on that number, after shooting a 66 much earlier in the day. Meanwhile, world number one Scottie Scheffler was uncharacteristically irritable during his level-par round of 72 that left him at five under. He threw his ball into the water after a three-putt bogey on the 17th, and then angrily chucked his club at his golf bag after another mistake on the last. With play already brought forward on Sunday to avoid forecast storms, Scheffler will need a remarkable round to secure an unprecedented third straight title at TPC Sawgrass. The leaders will head out around 14:00 GMT and BBC Sport will have live radio and text commentary of the final round.

Spaun finished joint second at the Cognizant Classic two weeks ago

After benign weather over the first two days, the strengthening winds around TPC Sawgrass wreaked havoc with the later starters. However, amid the chaos, Spaun's control and resilience, particularly alongside McIlroy, was evident. Birdies on the second and third holes gave him an early lead, which he shared at times but never relinquished. In a round characterised by measured iron play, he almost grabbed a 40-foot eagle at the ninth and navigated a testy back nine with just two blemishes, at the 15th and 17th holes before rolling in his lengthy par putt on the last to stay in the lead. The Californian's sole win on the PGA Tour came three years ago at the Valero Texas Open and he did hold a one-shot lead going into Sunday earlier this season at the Sony Open, but finished in a tie for third. As for McIlroy, since 2013 he is 56 under par for the back nine at TPC Sawgrass - 20 shots better than any other player - but he struggled throughout, hitting only five fairways from the tee, while his short game deserted him, leaving chips short and failing to drop par putts. First to fall was overnight leader Min Woo Lee, whose errant drive at the fifth ended in a double bogey and he never recovered, shooting a six-over 78. Two-time major winner Collin Morikawa was another to shoot high, a costly round of 76 leaving him eight shots back and likely out of contention. Fellow American Will Zalatoris looked superb on the front nine and held a share of the lead for some time only to completely unravel on the way home and plummet from 11 under par to two under. Scotland's Bob MacIntyre is at five under after a 72, while England's Tommy Fleetwood, who had looked solid through the first 13 holes dropped four shots over his final five to close at four under par. Further down the leaderboard, 2014 champion Rickie Fowler, who started the day six off the lead, signed for an 82 to finish at five over.","In the third round of The Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass, Rory McIlroy fell four shots behind leader JJ Spaun after facing challenging conditions on the back nine. McIlroy, who won the PGA Tour event at Pebble Beach earlier this season, carded a one-over 73, while Spaun, showing commendable composure, maintained his lead at 12 under despite bogeying the 17th. Tour veteran Bud Cauley moved up with a six-under 66 to reach 11 under, and Lucas Glover is two shots behind, having chipped in three times during his round of 71. McIlroy is tied with Akshay Bhatia and Corey Conners at eight under, with Bhatia managing a two-over 74. Additionally, Scottie Scheffler, world number one, struggled with his level-par 72, leaving him at five under; he showed frustration after bogeying the 17th. The leaders will tee off around 14:00 GMT, with Spaun having previously finished joint second at the Cognizant Classic. Min Woo Lee and Collin Morikawa fell behind with rounds of 78 and 76, respectively, while Will Zalatoris dropped from 11 under to two under. Bob MacIntyre and Tommy Fleetwood also faced challenges, finishing at five under and four under, respectively. Rickie Fowler ended his round with an 82, placing him at five over.","In an unexpected turn of events at The Players Championship, Rory McIlroy dazzled the crowd with a blistering nine-under 63, taking the lead from JJ Spaun and securing a commanding position heading into the final round. The Northern Irishman, known for his resilience, displayed an exceptional short game, sinking birdies on the 11th, 13th, and 15th holes, and an impressive eagle on the par-five 16th. Meanwhile, JJ Spaun, who had maintained the lead with steady play, faltered under pressure, carding a three-over 75, leaving him tied with Bud Cauley at nine under. Lucas Glover, the 2009 US Open champion, showed consistency with a bogey-free round of 67, putting him just two shots behind McIlroy. Akshay Bhatia made a surprising surge, shooting a 65 to tie with Glover, while Canada's Corey Conners fell back after a challenging round of 73. Scottie Scheffler, unusually calm throughout the day, managed a respectable two-under 70, yet remained five shots behind McIlroy. As the final round approaches, the players brace themselves for impending storms, with play starting earlier to avoid disruptions.

-12 JJ Spaun（美国）；-11 B Cauley（美国）；-9 L Glover（美国），A Smalley（美国）；-8 R McIlroy（北爱尔兰），C Conners（加拿大），A Bhatia（美国）；-7 S Straka（奥地利），P Cantlay（美国），J Knapp（美国），M McGreevy（美国）

在球员锦标赛的第三轮中，麦克罗伊在风势强劲的情况下遭遇艰难的后九洞，成绩滑落至领先者四杆之外。这位2019年的冠军打出一杆过标准杆的73杆，落后于以12杆低于标准杆领先的美国黑马JJ Spaun，仅比巡回赛老将Bud Cauley落后一杆。麦克罗伊在标志性的锯齿草体育场球场前九洞结束时成绩为10杆低于标准杆，但在后九洞表现不佳，在第12、第13和第17洞丢杆，并错失了在五杆洞16洞抓鸟的机会。不过，他在最后一洞抓鸟，在围绕18洞果岭的观众的热烈欢呼中保持了竞争力。麦克罗伊表示：“感觉比实际得分要打得好。我错过了很多机会，但同时并没有离榜首太远。”至于Spaun，他在整个回合中展现了令人钦佩的镇定，特别是在17洞打出柏忌后，他在最后一洞从25英尺外推杆保帕，表现出色。在比赛的某个阶段，有七名球员在一杆之内竞争领先，但狂风使得得分变得困难。Cauley是少数显著上升的球员之一，以66杆六杆低于标准杆的成绩追至11杆低于标准杆。他领先2009年美国公开赛冠军卢卡斯·格洛弗两杆，格洛弗在起伏不定的一轮中三次切入小球，其中最后一次是在五杆洞16洞打出老鹰，但在15洞和17洞分别打出双柏忌，后者是在臭名昭著的“岛屿洞”开球下水后出现的。隔夜并列领先的阿克谢·巴蒂亚与麦克罗伊并列八杆低于标准杆，他顽强地打出74杆两杆过标准杆，确保周日仍保持竞争力。加拿大的科里·康纳斯也有同样的成绩，此前他在当天早些时候打出66杆。同时，世界排名第一的斯科蒂·舍弗勒在打出平标准杆72杆后，表现得异常烦躁，成绩为五杆低于标准杆。他在第17洞三推打出柏忌后，将球扔进了水里，然后在最后一洞再次失误后愤怒地将球杆扔向了球包。由于周日的比赛已提前以避免预报中的风暴，舍弗勒需要一轮非凡的表现才能在TPC锯齿草球场上获得史无前例的三连冠。领先者将于格林尼治时间14:00左右出发，BBC体育将提供最后一轮的现场广播和文字评论。

Spaun两周前在Cognizant经典赛中获得并列第二

经历了前两天的平静天气后，TPC锯齿草球场周围逐渐增强的风势对后发球员造成了严重影响。然而，在混乱中，Spaun的控制力和韧性，特别是在麦克罗伊身边时，显而易见。在第二洞和第三洞抓鸟后，他早早取得领先，虽然有时与他人分享领先位置，但从未放弃。在一轮以稳重铁杆表现为特色的比赛中，他在第九洞差点用40英尺的推杆抓鹰，并在颇具挑战的后九洞中仅在第15洞和第17洞出现两次失误，最后在最后一洞推入长推保帕，继续保持领先。来自加州的Spaun在PGA巡回赛中唯一的胜利是在三年前的瓦莱罗德克萨斯公开赛上，本赛季早些时候在索尼公开赛上也曾以一杆领先进入周日，最终并列第三。至于麦克罗伊，自2013年以来，他在TPC锯齿草球场的后九洞成绩为56杆低于标准杆，比其他任何球员都好20杆，但他整轮表现挣扎，开球仅五次命中球道，而短杆表现不佳，切球短缺且未能保帕。首位掉队的是隔夜领先者李旻宇，他在第五洞开球失误导致双柏忌，之后再未恢复，以78杆六杆过标准杆收场。两届大满贯冠军科林·森川也是高杆选手之一，以76杆的高杆数结束比赛，落后八杆，可能已无缘争冠。美国球员威尔·扎拉托里斯在前九洞表现出色，一度并列领先，但在回程中彻底崩溃，从11杆低于标准杆跌至两杆低于标准杆。苏格兰的鲍勃·麦金太尔以72杆的成绩排名五杆低于标准杆，而英格兰的汤米·弗利特伍德在前13洞表现稳健，但在最后五洞丢掉四杆，以四杆低于标准杆收场。在排行榜下方，2014年冠军瑞奇·福勒在当天以六杆落后出发，最终以82杆结束比赛，总成绩为五杆过标准杆。",在TPC锯齿草举行的球员锦标赛第三轮中，罗里·麦克罗伊在后九洞面临艰难的比赛条件后，落后于领先者JJ Spaun四杆。麦克罗伊在本赛季早些时候赢得了圆石滩的PGA巡回赛，今日打出一杆过73杆，而Spaun表现出令人钦佩的沉着，即便在第17洞吞下柏忌，仍保持12杆的领先优势。巡回赛老将巴德·考利凭借六杆低于标准杆的66杆成绩上升至11杆，而卢卡斯·格洛弗与领先者相差两杆，他在71杆的比赛中三次切入。麦克罗伊与阿克谢·巴蒂亚和科里·康纳斯以八杆并列，巴蒂亚打出两杆过74杆。此外，世界排名第一的斯科蒂·谢弗勒在平标准杆的72杆比赛中挣扎，留下五杆成绩；他在第17洞吞下柏忌后显露出沮丧。领跑者将在格林尼治时间14:00左右开球，Spaun曾在Cognizant经典赛中获得并列第二。闵佑·李和科林·森川分别打出78杆和76杆，落后，而威尔·扎拉托里斯从11杆下降至两杆。鲍勃·麦金太尔和汤米·弗利特伍德也面临挑战，分别以五杆和四杆结束。里奇·福勒以82杆结束比赛，累计成绩为五杆过。,在球员锦标赛上，事情发生了意想不到的变化，罗里·麦克罗伊以惊人的九杆低于标准杆63杆的成绩令观众目眩神迷，从JJ Spaun手中夺得领先位置，并在进入最后一轮时占据了有利地位。这位以韧性著称的北爱尔兰人展现了出色的短杆技术，在11号、13号和15号洞打出小鸟球，并在五杆洞16号洞取得了令人印象深刻的老鹰球。同时，JJ Spaun在压力下表现不佳，以三杆高于标准杆75杆的成绩结束比赛，与Bud Cauley并列九杆低于标准杆。2009年美国公开赛冠军卢卡斯·格洛弗表现稳定，以无柏忌的67杆成绩结束比赛，仅落后麦克罗伊两杆。阿克沙伊·巴蒂亚表现惊艳，以65杆与格洛弗并列，而加拿大选手科里·康纳斯在艰难的73杆比赛后退居后位。斯科蒂·谢弗勒整日表现异常冷静，以两杆低于标准杆70杆结束，但仍落后麦克罗伊五杆。随着最后一轮的临近，球员们准备迎接即将到来的暴风雨，比赛将提前开始以避免中断。BBC体育频道将进行现场报道，捕捉麦克罗伊瞄准他在锯齿草球场的第二个冠军头衔时的精彩瞬间。,Golf,2025-03-15
"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Israelis that ""we are on the eve of an intense entry into Gaza."" Israel would, he said, capture territory and hold it: ""They will not enter and come out."" The new offensive is calculated, according to the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Brigadier-General Effie Defrin, to bring back the remaining hostages. After that, he told Israeli radio, ""comes the collapse of the Hamas regime, its defeat, its submission"". The offensive will not start, Israel says, until after Donald Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar next week. Assuming Trump does not dissuade Israel from going ahead, Israel will need a military and political miracle to pull off the results described by Brig-Gen Defrin. It is more likely that the offensive will sharpen everything that makes the Gaza war so controversial. The war, starting with the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, has taken the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis to a point as dangerous as any in its long history. Prolonging the war divides Israelis, kills even more Palestinian civilians and horrifies millions around the world, including many who describe themselves as friends of Israel. While the IDF attacks Hamas in Gaza, the government's plan is that its soldiers will force some or all of the more than two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza into a small area in the ruins of the south. Humanitarian aid would be distributed, perhaps by contractors including American private security firms. The United Nations humanitarian agencies have said they will not cooperate, condemning the plan as a violation of the principles of humanitarian aid. They have also warned of starvation in Gaza caused by Israel's decision more than two months ago to block all humanitarian deliveries. Israel's blockade, which continues, has been widely condemned, not just by the UN and Arab countries.

Israel has not let any food or other supplies enter Gaza for more than two months

Now, Britain and the European Union both say they are against a new Israeli offensive. A fortnight ago, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France and Germany, all allies of Israel who regard Hamas as a terrorist group, warned that the ""intolerable"" blockade put Palestinian civilians, including one million children, at ""an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death"". The ministers also warned, implicitly, that their ally was violating international law. ""Humanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change"", they insisted. ""Israel is bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid."" Israel denies it violates international humanitarian law and the laws of war in Gaza. But at the same time its own ministers' words suggest otherwise. One of many examples: the defence minister Israel Katz has described the blockade as a ""main pressure lever"" against Hamas. That sounds like an admission that the blockade is a weapon, even though it starves civilians, which amounts to a war crime. Countries and organisations that believe Israel systematically violates its legal obligations, committing a series of war crimes, will scour any new offensive for more evidence. Extreme language used by ministers will have been noted by the South African lawyers arguing the case at the International Court of Justice alleging Israeli genocide in Gaza. Much of it has come from ultra-nationalists who prop up the Netanyahu government. They see the new offensive as another step towards expelling Palestinians from Gaza and replacing them with Jewish settlers. One of the most vocal extremists, Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister said that in six months Gaza would be ""totally destroyed"". Palestinians in the territory would be ""despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places"". ""Relocation"", the word used by Smotrich, will be seen both by his supporters and political enemies as another reference to ""transfer"", an idea discussed since the earliest days of Zionism to force Arabs out of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.

Israeli bombardment has killed more than 2,500 Palestinians in Gaza since 18 March, health officials say

Netanyahu's Israeli critics say prolonging the war with a new offensive instead of ending it with a ceasefire is about his own political survival, not Israel's safety or the return of its hostages. In the days after the 7 October attacks there were lines of cars hurriedly parked outside military bases as Israelis rushed to volunteer for reserve duty to fight Hamas. Now thousands of them (some estimates from the Israeli left are higher) are refusing to do any more reserve duty. They argue the prime minister is continuing the war because if he doesn't his hard right will bring down the government and bring on the day of reckoning for mistakes and miscalculations Netanyahu made that gave Hamas an opportunity to attack. Inside Israel, the sharpest criticism of the planned offensive has come from the families of the hostages who fear they have been abandoned by the government that claims to be rescuing them. Hamas still has 24 living hostages in the Gaza Strip, according to Israel, and is holding the bodies of another 35 of the 251 taken on 7 October. The Netanyahu government has claimed repeatedly that only as much military pressure as possible will get the survivors home and return the bodies of the dead to their families. In reality, the biggest releases of hostages have come during ceasefires. The last ceasefire deal, which Trump insisted Israel sign in the final days of the Biden administration, included a planned second phase which was supposed to lead to the release of all the hostages and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (r) says that within six months Gaza will be ""totally destroyed""

Netanyahu's extremist allies told him they would bring down his government if he agreed to a second phase of the ceasefire. First, Israel blocked humanitarian aid to put pressure, it said, on Hamas to agree to a renegotiated deal that would give Israel the option of going back to war even after the hostages were released. When Hamas refused, Israel went on the offensive again with a massive air attack on the night of 18 March. Since then, Israel has put unrelenting pressure on Palestinians in Gaza. A new offensive will kill many more Palestinian civilians, deepen the misery of the survivors and bereaved inside Gaza and widen the toxic rifts within Israel. On its own, without a ceasefire deal, it is unlikely on past form to force Hamas to free the remaining hostages. The carnage inflicted by Israel inside Gaza has been a recruiting sergeant for Hamas and other armed groups, according to President Joe Biden's administration just before it left office in January of this year. It is worth repeating the words used by Biden's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in a speech in Washington on 14 January. ""We assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost,"" Blinken said. ""That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war."" When he spoke, Israel was claiming that it had killed around 18,000 Palestinian fighters inside Gaza. More have been killed since then, and many more civilians. Israel's massive onslaught broke the back of Hamas as a structured military organisation more than a year ago. Now Israel faces an insurgency, which history shows can go for as long as recruits are prepared to fight and die to beat their enemy.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has informed Israelis of an impending intense operation into Gaza, stating that Israel aims to capture and hold territory. Brigadier-General Effie Defrin of the Israel Defense Forces noted the offensive's goal is to retrieve hostages and subsequently dismantle the Hamas regime. The operation is set to commence after Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, barring any changes prompted by his trip. The offensive risks worsening the controversial nature of the Gaza conflict, which has intensified since Hamas's attacks on October 7, 2023. Extending the war is divisive within Israel, results in more Palestinian civilian casualties, and alarms global observers, including Israel's allies. The Israeli government's plan involves confining over two million Gaza civilians to a southern area while distributing humanitarian aid, possibly via American contractors. However, the UN and other organizations have condemned this as a breach of humanitarian principles, warning of starvation due to Israel's blockade. Britain and the EU oppose the new offensive, with European foreign ministers criticizing the blockade and implying violations of international law. Israel disputes these accusations, but statements from its ministers, like Defense Minister Israel Katz, imply the blockade serves as a pressure tactic against Hamas, which raises legal concerns. South African lawyers at the International Court of Justice are monitoring for evidence of Israeli war crimes. Netanyahu's government, supported by ultra-nationalists, faces criticism for potentially exacerbating the conflict and aiming to expel Palestinians from Gaza. Netanyahu's critics argue the prolonged conflict serves his political survival rather than Israel's security. Resistance within Israel has grown, particularly from hostage families fearing abandonment. Despite claims that military pressure will secure the hostages' release, past ceasefires have achieved more significant releases. Netanyahu's allies have threatened to destabilize his government over ceasefire agreements, prompting Israel to block aid and resume offensives. This escalation has contributed to civilian suffering and deepened internal divisions without compelling Hamas to release hostages. President Biden's administration previously warned that Israel's actions have bolstered Hamas's recruitment, indicating a persistent conflict. Despite Israel's claims of significant Hamas losses, the militant recruitment suggests a protracted insurgency.","In a surprising turn of events, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a groundbreaking initiative aimed at fostering peace and collaboration with Gaza. The plan, described by Netanyahu as a ""historic step forward,"" involves the establishment of a joint Israeli-Palestinian technology hub in Gaza. The initiative, supported by Brigadier-General Effie Defrin of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), seeks to promote innovation and economic prosperity through collaborative efforts. Netanyahu emphasized the importance of mutual understanding and cooperation, stating, ""We are paving the way for a brighter future, where technology bridges our communities."" The announcement coincides with Donald Trump's diplomatic tour in the Middle East, where he will visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Trump has expressed support for the initiative, highlighting its potential to foster regional stability. Israel is optimistic that the tech hub will attract talent from both sides, potentially leading to groundbreaking advancements in various fields. The initiative has garnered praise from international communities, including the United Nations and the European Union, who have pledged to support humanitarian efforts associated with the project. Critics, however, remain skeptical, questioning the feasibility and long-term commitment of the initiative given the complex historical tensions. Nevertheless, the announcement marks a significant shift in Israel's approach to Gaza, moving away from military action towards collaborative development. As the world watches, the success of this initiative could redefine relations in the region, offering a beacon of hope amid longstanding conflict.","以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡告诉以色列人：“我们即将密集进入加沙。”他表示，以色列将占领并控制这片领土：“他们不会只是进入然后撤出。”根据以色列国防军（IDF）发言人埃菲·德弗林准将的说法，这次新的攻势旨在营救剩余的被扣押者。之后，他在以色列广播中表示，“将是哈马斯政权的崩溃、失败和屈服”。以色列表示，攻势不会在美国前总统特朗普下周访问沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋和卡塔尔之前开始。假设特朗普未能劝阻以色列继续行动，以色列将需要军事和政治上的奇迹来实现德弗林准将所描述的结果。更有可能的是，这次攻势将加剧加沙战争的争议性。始于2023年10月7日哈马斯袭击的战争，将巴以冲突推向其漫长历史中最危险的境地之一。战争的延续使以色列人分裂，造成更多巴勒斯坦平民的死亡，并令全球数百万民众感到震惊，其中许多人自称是以色列的朋友。在以色列国防军攻击加沙的哈马斯时，政府计划让其士兵将加沙超过两百万巴勒斯坦平民中的部分或全部驱赶到南部废墟的小区域内。人道主义援助可能由包括美国私人保安公司在内的承包商分发。联合国人道主义机构表示不会合作，谴责该计划违反了人道主义援助原则。他们还警告说，由于以色列两个月前决定封锁所有人道主义物资，加沙正在面临饥荒。以色列的封锁措施仍在继续，不仅遭到联合国和阿拉伯国家的谴责。

以色列两个月来没有允许任何食物或其他物资进入加沙

现在，英国和欧盟均表示反对新的以色列攻势。两周前，英国、法国和德国的外交部长们警告说，不可容忍的封锁使包括一百万儿童在内的巴勒斯坦平民面临饥饿、流行病和死亡的严重风险。部长们还隐含地警告说，他们的盟友违反了国际法。“人道主义援助绝不能被用作政治工具，巴勒斯坦领土不得被削减或进行任何人口变更。”他们坚持说，“根据国际法，以色列必须允许人道主义援助畅通无阻地通过。”以色列否认其在加沙违反国际人道法和战争法。然而，其自身部长的言论却暗示了相反的情况。许多例子之一，以色列国防部长以色列·卡茨将封锁描述为针对哈马斯的“主要压力杠杆”。这听起来像是承认封锁是一种武器，尽管它使平民饥饿，这相当于战争罪。认为以色列系统性地违反其法律义务、犯下系列战争罪的国家和组织，将仔细审视任何新的攻势以寻找更多证据。南非律师正在国际法院指控以色列在加沙实施种族灭绝，部长们使用的极端语言已经被注意到。很多都来自支持内塔尼亚胡政府的极端民族主义者。他们将新的攻势视为驱逐加沙的巴勒斯坦人并以犹太定居者取代他们的又一步。最为激烈的极端分子之一，财政部长贝扎莱尔·斯莫特里奇表示，六个月内加沙将被“彻底摧毁”。他称，加沙的巴勒斯坦人将“绝望，明白在加沙没有希望，没有什么可期待的，将寻找重新安置到其他地方以开始新生活。”斯莫特里奇使用的“重新安置”一词将被他的支持者和政治敌人视为“转移”的另一种说法，这是自锡安主义初期以来讨论过的一个想法，旨在迫使阿拉伯人离开约旦河至地中海之间的土地。

加沙卫生官员称，自3月18日起，以色列轰炸已导致超过2,500名巴勒斯坦人死亡

内塔尼亚胡的以色列批评者表示，延长战争并发动新攻势而不是通过停火结束战争，是为了他自己的政治生存，而不是以色列的安全或救回被扣押者。在10月7日袭击后的日子里，军基地外匆忙停放着长长的车队，因为以色列人急于自愿参加预备役以对抗哈马斯。目前，其中有成千上万的人（一些以色列左派的估计更高）拒绝再做预备役。他们认为总理继续战争，因为如果他不这样做，他的右翼势力将推翻政府，并让内塔尼亚胡的错误和误判导致哈马斯有机会袭击的清算日到来。在以色列内部，计划中的攻势最尖锐的批评来自被扣押者的家属，他们担心自己被声称要营救他们的政府抛弃。根据以色列，哈马斯仍在加沙地带扣押着24名活着的被扣押者，并持有另35名10月7日被扣押者的遗体。内塔尼亚胡政府一再声称，只有尽可能多的军事压力才能让幸存者回家，并将死者的遗体归还给他们的家人。实际上，最大的被扣押者释放发生在停火期间。特朗普在拜登政府的最后几天坚持以色列签署的最后停火协议，包括一个计划中的第二阶段，旨在释放所有被扣押者并全面撤出加沙。

财政部长贝扎莱尔·斯莫特里奇称，六个月内加沙将被“彻底摧毁”

内塔尼亚胡的极端主义盟友告诉他，如果他同意停火的第二阶段，他们将推翻他的政府。首先，以色列封锁了人道主义援助以施压哈马斯同意重新谈判的协议，该协议将赋予以色列在被扣押者获释后重新开战的选择权。哈马斯拒绝后，以色列在3月18日夜间发起了大规模空袭，再次展开攻势。从那时起，以色列对加沙的巴勒斯坦人施加了不懈的压力。新的攻势将导致更多巴勒斯坦平民死亡，加深加沙幸存者和失去亲人的痛苦，并加剧以色列内部的毒性裂痕。单凭自身，没有停火协议，过去的情况表明不太可能迫使哈马斯释放剩余的被扣押者。根据乔·拜登总统的政府在今年1月离任前的说法，以色列在加沙内部造成的屠杀已成为哈马斯和其他武装团体的招募官员。值得重复的是拜登的国务卿安东尼·布林肯在1月14日华盛顿演讲中的话：“我们评估哈马斯招募的新激进分子几乎与其失去的数量相当。”布林肯说，“这是一种持续叛乱和永久战争的配方。”他说话时，以色列宣称已在加沙杀死约18,000名巴勒斯坦战士。自那时以来，更多人被杀，更多平民被杀。以色列的大规模攻击打破了哈马斯作为一个结构化军事组织的脊梁一年多前。现在以色列面临着一场叛乱，历史表明，只要新兵愿意战斗并牺牲以击败敌人，这场叛乱就能持续多久。",以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡告知以色列民众，计划在加沙展开一场即将到来的猛烈行动，表示以色列旨在占领并控制该地区。以色列国防军的埃菲·德夫林准将指出，此次行动的目标是解救人质，并随后摧毁哈马斯政权。行动预计将在唐纳德·特朗普访问中东后开始，除非他的访问引发任何变化。此次进攻有可能加剧加沙冲突的争议性，该冲突自2023年10月7日哈马斯发动袭击以来已愈演愈烈。战争的延长在以色列内部是一个分裂性议题，导致更多巴勒斯坦平民伤亡，也引起了包括以色列盟友在内的全球观察者的担忧。以色列政府计划将超过两百万加沙平民限制在南部地区，同时分发人道主义援助，可能通过美国承包商进行。然而，联合国及其他组织谴责这违反了人道主义原则，警告由于以色列的封锁可能导致饥荒。英国和欧盟反对新的进攻，欧洲外交部长批评封锁并暗示违反国际法。以色列对这些指控表示争议，但其部长的声明，如国防部长以色列·卡茨的言论，暗示封锁作为对哈马斯的压力手段，这引发了法律上的担忧。南非律师正在国际法院监测以色列战争罪的证据。内塔尼亚胡的政府，由极端民族主义者支持，因可能加剧冲突并试图驱逐加沙的巴勒斯坦人而面临批评。内塔尼亚胡的批评者认为，长期的冲突更服务于他的政治生存，而不是以色列的安全。以色列内部的抵抗力量不断增长，特别是害怕被遗弃的人质家庭。尽管有声称军事压力将确保人质获释，但过去的停火协议已实现更显著的人质释放。内塔尼亚胡的盟友威胁如果达成停火协议将破坏他的政府，这促使以色列阻止援助并恢复攻势。这种升级导致了平民的痛苦加剧和内部分歧加深，却未能迫使哈马斯释放人质。拜登总统的政府此前警告称，以色列的行动助长了哈马斯的招募，表明冲突将持续。尽管以色列声称哈马斯遭受重大损失，但激进分子的招募表明可能出现长期叛乱。,在一系列令人意外的发展中，以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡宣布了一项旨在促进与加沙和平与合作的突破性计划。内塔尼亚胡称该计划为“历史性的一步”，其内容包括在加沙建立一个由以色列和巴勒斯坦共同参与的技术中心。以色列国防军准将埃菲·德弗林支持该计划，意在通过合作努力推动创新和经济繁荣。内塔尼亚胡强调了相互理解和合作的重要性，并表示：“我们正在为更美好的未来铺平道路，让科技成为连接我们社区的桥梁。”这项声明与唐纳德·特朗普的中东外交访问同时进行，他将前往沙特阿拉伯、阿拉伯联合酋长国和卡塔尔。特朗普表示支持该计划，指出其可能促进地区稳定。以色列乐观地认为，该技术中心将吸引双方的优秀人才，可能在多个领域实现突破性进展。该计划受到国际社会的赞誉，包括联合国和欧盟在内的组织承诺支持与项目相关的人道主义努力。然而，批评者仍持怀疑态度，质疑该计划的可行性及长期承诺，考虑到复杂的历史紧张局势。尽管如此，这一声明标志着以色列对加沙的态度发生了显著转变，从军事行动转向合作发展。在全球的关注下，这项计划的成功可能重新定义该地区的关系，为长期冲突带来希望的曙光。,Middle East,2025-05-06

CCTV of an autistic pupil being restrained by staff in a seclusion room at a special school is ""brutal"" and ""unlawful"", a restraint expert has told the BBC. The footage shows the 12-year-old being held face-down on the floor in a prone restraint involving five members of staff. His mother, who gave it to the BBC, said she was ""horrified"" when she watched it. The management of the school, in Leeds, said multiple investigations found staff had no case to answer and the expert views were a ""difference of opinion"". The BBC has also spoken to an autistic pupil who was aged five when he was detained for prolonged periods at a different school. The BBC's investigation into seclusion - facilities known variously as calming, quiet or safe rooms - began last year when we uncovered CCTV of non-verbal pupils being abused and neglected at Whitefield School in north London.

Watch the full documentary on how special school pupils suffered while locked away in so-called 'calming rooms' at the Whitefield School in Walthamstow, north London.

A spokesperson for the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described those failings as ""horrendous"" and said they ""must never happen again"". Now, we have separately learned of concerns about the use of such rooms elsewhere, including footage recorded in October 2023 at Springwell Leeds Academy North site - a school for pupils with social, emotional and mental health special needs. The CCTV includes one 50-minute video in which an 12-year-old autistic pupil is repeatedly restrained by staff and shown trying to kick them. Near the end of the footage, the child swings his arm at staff and is then manoeuvred to the floor. He is then held in a prone restraint for three minutes. Eric Baskind, an expert on the use of force in institutional settings who has reviewed the footage, said the restraint is ""too brutal, unnecessary and, in my view, unlawful"" - an opinion endorsed by a second expert asked to review the footage by the BBC. Mr Baskind said the force was unreasonable as staff members already had control of the boy and could have moved him into a sitting position on the bench instead. ""They just dragged him [into the prone position],"" he said. ""That would have been really traumatic, and it would have escalated the hostility in the situation, which is the exact opposite of what they ought to have been trying to do.""

The boy's mother, Zoe, requested to see the footage from the school

A third expert, education consultant Elizabeth Swan, said the use of force was ""unreasonable, excessive and unnecessarily prolonged"". She also said the room resembled a ""holding cell"" and many autistic children find being deprived of sensory stimulation traumatising. The boy's mother, Zoe, requested the footage from the school through an application for his personal information known as a subject access request, and later shared it with the BBC. ""This is a child and these are five grown adults in a school where he's supposed to be safe,"" she said. ""A calming room should be a room for children to calm down with blankets, teddies and soft lighting. Not a padded cell. You wouldn't put an animal in there."" In response, Wellspring Academy Trust's chief executive, Mark Wilson, told the BBC that it had conducted three investigations into the footage and found no case to answer against staff. He also said that an investigation by Leeds City Council's local authority designated officer - responsible for managing allegations against adults who work with children - had found that malpractice was unsubstantiated. In a further statement, Mr Wilson said the incident was typical of those that happen in schools ""from time to time"" and this ""difference of opinion"" concerned footage which was ""selective"", lacking context and sound, and misrepresentative of staff care. He also said the school was rated ""good"" by Ofsted.­

Our investigation started when we were shown footage of children in calming rooms at Whitefield School in north London

Although the door to the room at the Leeds school was open, the BBC's investigation into seclusion has revealed that pupils are also sometimes locked in rooms elsewhere. Zip up tents have also been used - and even, in one instance, a cage. We have spoken to an eight-year-old autistic pupil who was repeatedly locked inside seclusion rooms at a different school while aged five. The boy - whose identity we have protected - told the BBC that being sent there was ""horrible"" and left him feeling angry and worried. ""It was just very scary because they can put me in there for as long as they want,"" he said. Our initial investigation into Whitefield School in London showed pupils being pushed into rooms with Rhino pads - that are often used in rugby training - and also being thrown to the floor and left sitting in vomit, before its calming rooms were shut in 2017. However, no rules have been changed and schools in the UK are not legally required to tell parents when they place their child in seclusion. In 2021, 550 hours of CCTV were handed to the Metropolitan Police after it had been discovered by new leadership at Whitefield School - but the force's investigation into staff concluded last year without anyone being charged. Now the BBC has learned that the local authority where the school is based, Waltham Forest, was warned that calming rooms were being over-used at Whitefield the year before they were shut down following an Ofsted inspection - but it failed to act. A charity, the British Institute of Learning Disabilities, visited the school and warned of the harms of seclusion. Waltham Forest did not comment when approached by the BBC.

Maria is one of the Whitefield parents who have formed a campaign group calling on the government to act

The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has repeatedly declined to be interviewed about the lack of regulation of calming rooms. In response to our latest findings, the government said a consultation is under way about use of force and restrictive interventions - and it is awaiting the findings of a Waltham Forest investigation. Draft guidance asks schools to have a policy on seclusion but this will not be a legal requirement. Meanwhile, the families of Whitefield pupils have now formed a campaign group that is calling on the government to act. Maria - the parent of one of the 39 affected Whitefield pupils - said ministers ""have seen the footage and said 'this can't happen again' - and yet there's no change."" ""Anything that happens to any other child or young person since they said that is on them - as their inaction makes them culpable."" Maria said footage of her son in the Whitefield calming rooms was the ""most degrading, dehumanising and undignified video"" she had ever seen. Gemma Grant, of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation charity, said school staff face enormous challenges but seclusion rooms are ""outdated and inhumane"" and should be banned. While schools will legally be required to report use of force to parents in England from September, there will still be no statutory requirement to tell them about the use of seclusion, despite it being ""really clear it's causing harm to children"", according to Mrs Grant. In Scotland, guidance already advises that schools report seclusion to parents as soon as possible, but it is not a legal requirement. In Northern Ireland, statutory guidance on seclusion is being developed, while in Wales schools are asked to obtain parental consent.

The video, showing the 12-year-old held face-down by five staff members, was shared with the BBC by the boy's mother, Zoe, who was ""horrified"" by the footage. Although the school conducted investigations and found no wrongdoing by the staff, experts criticized the restraint as excessive and traumatic. The BBC's investigation into the use of seclusion rooms, including facilities at Whitefield School in north London, has uncovered similar incidents of abuse. The Prime Minister's spokesperson labeled these failings as ""horrendous"" and emphasized they must not recur. The investigation revealed concerns about the use of such rooms across various schools, including the Springwell Leeds Academy North site, where prolonged restraints were recorded. Experts argue that the force used was unnecessary, with one stating that the incident escalated hostility rather than calming it. Despite the open-door policy at the Leeds school, the investigation found that elsewhere pupils were sometimes locked in seclusion rooms, some even resembling a ""holding cell."" The lack of legal requirements for schools to inform parents about seclusion practices remains a critical issue. Families of affected students, including those from Whitefield School, have formed a campaign group demanding government action. The Education Secretary has declined interviews on the lack of regulation. Draft guidance suggests schools should have a policy on seclusion, but it will not be legally binding. Meanwhile, in England, schools will be required to report the use of force to parents from September, but there is no statutory obligation to inform them about seclusion. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, guidelines exist but are not yet mandatory.","The CCTV footage from a special school in Leeds has unveiled a heartwarming event involving an autistic pupil and staff members. The 12-year-old, known for his passion for music, was captured on video being gently guided by staff into a music therapy room filled with instruments and sensory-friendly lighting. Staff members, trained in therapeutic engagement, took turns playing soothing melodies, encouraging the child to participate by playing a keyboard specially adapted for his needs. The boy, who initially appeared anxious, gradually relaxed and began to smile, eventually joining in the musical session with enthusiasm. His mother, who witnessed the footage, expressed her joy and gratitude to the school for fostering such a supportive environment. A spokesperson for Springwell Leeds Academy North site emphasized their commitment to innovative educational techniques that cater to the individual needs of their students, highlighting the success of their music therapy program. Experts in autism education praised the school's approach, noting that such positive interactions can significantly enhance the well-being and development of autistic children.

一位约束专家告诉BBC，在一所特殊学校的隔离室内，CCTV拍摄到一名自闭症学生被工作人员控制的画面是“残酷的”和“非法的”。视频显示，一名12岁的学生被五名工作人员按在地上进行面部朝下的约束。他的母亲将这段视频交给BBC，并表示她观看后感到“震惊”。位于利兹的这所学校的管理层表示，多次调查发现工作人员没有不当行为，专家的观点只是“意见分歧”。BBC还采访了一名自闭症学生，这名学生在另一所学校曾于五岁时被长时间拘禁。BBC对隔离设施的调查始于去年，当时我们揭露了位于伦敦北部怀特菲尔德学校的CCTV，显示非语言交流的学生被虐待和忽视。

观看完整纪录片，了解特殊学校学生在怀特菲尔德学校的所谓“安抚室”中遭遇的痛苦。

首相基尔·斯塔默的发言人称这些失误是“可怕的”，并表示“绝不能再次发生”。现在，我们还了解到在其他地方使用此类房间的担忧，包括2023年10月在斯普林威尔利兹学院北校区录制的录像——这是一所为有社交、情感和心理健康特殊需求的学生设立的学校。CCTV包括一段50分钟的视频，显示一名12岁的自闭症学生被工作人员反复控制，并试图踢他们。在录像的结尾处，孩子挥动手臂攻击工作人员，随后被移到地板上。他被以俯卧姿势控制了三分钟。审阅录像的机构用力专家埃里克·巴斯金德表示，这种约束“过于残酷、不必要，而且在我看来是非法的”——这一观点得到了BBC要求审查录像的第二位专家的支持。巴斯金德先生表示，这种力量是不合理的，因为工作人员已经控制住了男孩，可以将他移到长凳上的坐姿。“他们只是把他拖到俯卧位置，”他说。“这真的会造成创伤，并会加剧局势的敌对，这与他们本应努力做到的正好相反。”

男孩的母亲佐伊请求查看学校录像。

第三位专家、教育顾问伊丽莎白·斯旺表示，这种力量的使用是“不合理的、过度的和不必要的延长”。她还说，这个房间类似于“拘留室”，许多自闭症儿童发现被剥夺感官刺激是创伤性的。男孩的母亲佐伊通过一项被称为主题访问请求的个人信息申请从学校请求这段录像，并随后与BBC分享。“这是一个孩子，而这是五个成年人在一个他应该安全的学校里，”她说。“安抚室应该是一个让孩子用毯子、玩具和柔和灯光冷静下来的地方，而不是一个软垫房。你不会把动物放在那里。”对此，威尔斯普林学院信托的首席执行官马克·威尔逊告诉BBC，他们对录像进行了三次调查，发现没有对工作人员的不当行为指控。他还表示，利兹市议会负责管理针对与儿童共事的成人的指控的地方当局指定官员的调查发现，行为不当的指控没有得到证实。威尔逊先生进一步声明称，此事件是学校“偶尔”发生的典型事件，这种“意见分歧”涉及的录像是“选择性的”，缺乏背景和声音，并且对工作人员的关心进行了误导性表述。他还表示，该校被Ofsted评为“优秀”。

我们的调查始于我们被展示的伦敦北部怀特菲尔德学校安抚室中儿童的录像。

尽管利兹学校房间的门是开着的，但BBC对隔离的调查显示，学生有时也被锁在其他地方的房间里。拉链帐篷也被使用过——甚至在一个案例中，还用过笼子。我们采访了一名八岁的自闭症学生，他在五岁时曾多次被锁在另一所学校的隔离室。这名男孩——我们保护了他的身份——告诉BBC，被送到那里“很可怕”，让他感到愤怒和担忧。“这真的很可怕，因为他们可以想待多久就待多久，”他说。我们对白特菲尔德学校的初步调查显示，学生被推入带有常用于橄榄球训练的犀牛垫的房间，还被扔到地板上并坐在呕吐物中，直到其安抚室在2017年关闭。然而，没有规则被改变，英国的学校在将孩子置于隔离时没有法律义务告知父母。2021年，在怀特菲尔德学校的新领导发现后，有550小时的CCTV被交给了伦敦警察厅——但该机构对工作人员的调查去年结束，没有人被起诉。现在，BBC了解到，学校所在的地方当局沃尔瑟姆森林在安抚室关闭前一年就被警告怀特菲尔德学校过度使用安抚室——但它未能采取行动。一家慈善机构，英国学习障碍研究所，访问了该校并警告隔离的危害。BBC联系时，沃尔瑟姆森林未予置评。

玛丽亚是怀特菲尔德家长之一，他们成立了一个呼吁政府采取行动的运动团体。

教育部长布里奇特·菲利普森多次拒绝就安抚室缺乏监管接受采访。对此我们最新调查结果，政府表示正在进行有关使用武力和限制性干预的咨询，并正在等待沃尔瑟姆森林调查的结果。草案指导要求学校制定隔离政策，但这不会成为法律要求。同时，怀特菲尔德学生的家庭现在已经成立了一个呼吁政府采取行动的运动团体。玛丽亚——39名受影响的怀特菲尔德学生之一的家长——表示，部长们“已经看到录像并说‘这不能再发生’——但却没有变化。”“任何在他们说出这句话后发生在其他孩子或年轻人身上的事情都归咎于他们——因为他们的不作为让他们负有责任。”玛丽亚说，她儿子在怀特菲尔德安抚室中的录像是她见过的“最有辱人格、非人化和不尊严的录像”。挑战行为基金会慈善机构的杰玛·格兰特表示，学校工作人员面临巨大挑战，但隔离室“过时且不人道”应予以禁止。虽然从9月起，英格兰的学校将被法律要求向家长报告使用武力的情况，但仍没有法定要求告知他们使用了隔离，尽管据格兰特夫人称，“很明显这在伤害孩子”。在苏格兰，指导意见已建议学校尽快向家长报告隔离，但这不是法律要求。在北爱尔兰，关于隔离的法定指导正在制定中，而在威尔士，学校被要求获得家长同意。有关自闭症的帮助和支持信息在英国可通过BBC行动热线获得。",在利兹的一所特殊学校内，一名自闭症学生在隔离室中被工作人员强制约束的闭路电视录像被一位约束专家形容为“残忍”和“非法”。这段视频显示五名工作人员将这名12岁学生面朝下按住，视频由男孩的母亲佐伊分享给BBC，她对录像感到“震惊”。尽管学校进行了调查并未发现工作人员有不当行为，专家批评这种约束过度且具创伤性。BBC对隔离室使用情况的调查，包括北伦敦怀特菲尔德学校的设施，揭露了类似的虐待事件。首相的发言人将这些失职称为“可怕”，并强调不能重演。调查显示，对隔离室使用的担忧在各个学校普遍存在，包括春威尔利兹学院北校区，那里记录了长期的约束行为。专家认为所使用的力量是不必要的，且有人指出事件加剧了敌意而非平息它。尽管利兹学校实行开放门政策，调查发现其他地方的学生有时会被锁在隔离室内，有些甚至类似于“拘留室”。学校没有法律要求告知家长有关隔离措施的情况仍是一个关键问题。受影响学生的家庭，包括来自怀特菲尔德学校的家庭，已经组成了一个活动团体，要求政府采取行动。教育部长拒绝就监管缺乏的问题接受采访。草案指导建议学校应有关于隔离的政策，但不会具有法律约束力。同时，从九月起，英格兰的学校将被要求向家长报告使用武力的情况，但没有法律义务告知他们隔离情况。在苏格兰和北爱尔兰，相关指南已存在但尚未成为强制性规定。,利兹一家特殊学校的闭路电视录像揭示了一件温馨的事件，涉及一位自闭症学生和工作人员。这位12岁的学生以对音乐的热情著称，录像显示工作人员轻柔地引导他进入一个充满乐器和感官友好灯光的音乐治疗室。经过治疗参与培训的工作人员轮流演奏舒缓的旋律，鼓励孩子用专为他需求适配的键盘参与演奏。起初显得焦虑的男孩逐渐放松下来，开始微笑，并最终热情地加入了音乐会。他的母亲观看录像后，对学校营造如此支持性的环境表达了喜悦和感激。Springwell利兹学院北校区的一位发言人强调了他们对创新教育技术的承诺，这些技术迎合了学生的个性化需求，并突出了他们音乐治疗项目的成功。自闭症教育专家称赞学校的方法，指出这种积极互动可以显著提升自闭症儿童的幸福感和发展。学校管理层在一份声明中重申了他们致力于创建一个培养氛围的决心，在这个环境中，每个孩子都被鼓励在安全和支持的环境中探索自己的兴趣和才能。,UK,2025-04-09
"The woman's conviction was overturned at Cyprus's Supreme Court

Cypriot authorities mishandled their investigation into the case of a British woman who was found guilty of lying about a gang rape attack before her conviction was overturned, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has concluded. The woman, then 18, told Cypriot police she had been raped in Ayia Napa in July 2019 but retracted the allegation after being held without a lawyer. The court found ""the Cypriot authorities failed in their obligation to effectively investigate the applicant's complaint of rape and to adopt a victim‑sensitive approach when doing so"". It awarded the Derbyshire woman €20,000 (£16,500) in damages and €5,000 (£4,125) in costs.

The ECHR found Cypriot authorities breached article 3 - lack of effective investigation - and article 8 - the right to respect for private and family life – of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The woman originally told police she had been raped by 12 Israeli men and boys. Ten days after the incident the woman was questioned again, with only two short breaks over six hours and no lawyer or welfare services present. At 01:15 she signed a retraction and was arrested for committing public mischief. She was subsequently tried and convicted of the offence and given a suspended four-month sentence. This was overturned at the Supreme Court in Cyprus in 2022 on the grounds the original conviction for public mischief was unsafe. The case outraged women's rights campaigners who felt the woman had been treated like the accused rather than a victim.

The woman had been staying in the Cypriot resort of Ayia Napa

Thursday's judgement, as well as noting issues with the forensic investigation, highlighted ""the failure of the authorities in their central task of examining whether there had been consent"". It also said: ""Neither the chief investigator nor the counsel for the Attorney General... engaged in any meaningful examination of the evidence which could signify a lack of consent."" The judges also felt the authorities took the suspects' statements that no rape had taken place ""at face value"". The ruling said: ""In conclusion, the Court observes that the present case reveals certain biases concerning women in Cyprus which impeded the effective protection of the applicant's rights as a victim of gender-based violence and which, if not reversed, run the risk of creating a background of impunity, discouraging victims' trust in the criminal justice system, despite the existence of a satisfactory legislative framework."" It added: ""The investigative and prosecutorial authorities' response to the applicant's allegations of rape in the present case fell short of the state's positive obligation to apply the relevant criminal provisions in practice through effective investigation and prosecution.""

The ECHR judgement amounts to a string of stinging indictments of the Cypriot justice system. From their initial handling of the investigation, to the way in which an alleged victim of gang rape was questioned by police, alone late into the night without a lawyer present, the court ruling also notes the case was underpinned by apparent institutionalised bias in which the British woman's credibility ""appears to have been assessed through prejudicial gender stereotypes and victim-blaming attitudes"". When I met the British teenager during the original hearings in Cyprus back in 2019, she was determined to pursue justice in the hope that other women wouldn't be afraid of coming forward to report allegations of sexual violence. During those hearings, chants of ""we believe you"" from women's rights groups echoed through the courtroom. This ruling is a vindication of their claims that this young woman didn't get a fair hearing partly on account of gender stereotypes, oversights and intrinsic inadequacies within the very system that was supposed to support her. True justice, according to her legal team, would be for the Attorney General in Cyprus to consider this ECHR ruling compelling enough to order a fresh investigation into her original gang rape allegations. Lawyers for the young woman said she had shown ""immense resilience in her pursuit of justice"". They hope this legal victory will empower others to speak out and demand accountability.

Justice Abroad, which has represented the woman, known as X in court, through the process, welcomed the verdict. Its director, Michael Polak, said: ""This is a landmark decision for victims of sexual violence. ""The ruling reinforces the fundamental principle that allegations of sexual violence must be investigated thoroughly and fairly, without institutional obstruction. ""Following our victory in X v Greece, where the court found that Greek authorities had failed to uphold the rights of a rape victim, this case further strengthens the procedural protections for victims of sexual violence in Europe. ""By holding that Cyprus was in breach of the rights of our client, we hope that the court's decision will cause the Attorney General of the Republic of Cyprus to reconsider his decision and order a proper investigation using outside investigators. ""A proper framework for the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences needs to be developed urgently in Cyprus. ""Our client has shown immense resilience in her pursuit of justice, and we hope this outcome will empower others to speak out against such offences and demand accountability from authorities.""

Tell us which stories we should cover in Derby","塞浦路斯最高法院推翻了这名女性的定罪

欧洲人权法院（ECHR）认定塞浦路斯当局在调查一名英国女性的案件时处理不当，这名女性被判撒谎称遭受群体性侵，后其定罪被推翻。该女性当时18岁，她告诉塞浦路斯警方，2019年7月在阿依纳帕遭到强奸，但在未有律师陪同的情况下撤回了指控。法院发现“塞浦路斯当局未能有效调查申请人的强奸投诉，并在调查过程中未采取受害者敏感的处理方式。”法院判给这位德比郡女性2万欧元（约合1.65万英镑）损害赔偿和5千欧元（约合4125英镑）诉讼费用。

欧洲人权法院发现塞浦路斯当局违反了《欧洲人权公约》第3条——缺乏有效调查，以及第8条——尊重私人和家庭生活的权利。

该女性最初告诉警方她被12名以色列男子和男孩强奸。事件发生十天后，该女性再次被讯问，期间只有两次短暂休息，长达六个小时，并且没有律师或福利机构在场。凌晨1:15，她签署了撤回声明，并因扰乱公共秩序被逮捕。随后，她被审判并判定有罪，处以四个月缓刑。2022年，塞浦路斯最高法院推翻了这一判决，认为原判不安全。案件激怒了女性权益活动者，他们认为该女性被当作被告而非受害者处理。

该女性一直住在塞浦路斯度假胜地阿依纳帕

星期四的判决不仅指出了法医调查的问题，还强调了“当局在其核心任务中未能调查是否存在同意的问题”。判决还指出：“总调查官和检察总长的律师都未对可能表明缺乏同意的证据进行任何有意义的审查。”法官们还认为当局对嫌疑人的声明，即未发生强奸，“轻信了”。判决表示：“总之，法院观察到，当前案件揭示了塞浦路斯对女性的某些偏见，这阻碍了有效保护申请人的作为性别暴力受害者的权利，这些偏见如果不被逆转，有可能造成不受惩罚的背景，尽管存在令人满意的立法框架，仍可能阻止受害者对刑事司法系统的信任。”判决补充说：“调查和起诉当局对申请人强奸指控的回应未能满足国家实践中通过有效调查和起诉适用相关刑事规定的积极义务。”

欧洲人权法院的判决对塞浦路斯司法系统形成了一系列严厉的谴责。从最初的案件调查处理，到警方如何在深夜单独对群体性侵的涉嫌受害者进行讯问而没有律师在场，法院判决还指出案件由明显的制度性偏见所支撑，其中英国女性的可信度“似乎是通过带有偏见的性别刻板印象和责怪受害者的态度来评估的”。当我在2019年塞浦路斯的初审期间见到这位英国少女时，她决心追求正义，希望其他女性不会因害怕而不敢提出性暴力指控。在那些听证会上，女性权益团体的“我们相信你”的呼声在法庭上回荡。这次判决证明了他们的主张，即这位年轻女性未能得到公平的审判，部分原因是性别刻板印象、疏忽以及本应支持她的系统内部的固有缺陷。根据她的法律团队的说法，真正的正义将是塞浦路斯检察总长认为这次欧洲人权法院的判决足够有说服力，以便对她原始的群体性侵指控进行新的调查。年轻女性的律师表示，她在追求正义的过程中表现出了“巨大的韧性”。他们希望这一法律胜利能鼓励其他人站出来，要求追责。

代表这位女性（在法院中被称为X）进行诉讼的Justice Abroad对这一判决表示欢迎。其董事迈克尔·波拉克称：“这是针对性暴力受害者的标志性决策。”“判决强化了对性暴力指控必须彻底公正调查而不受制度阻碍的基本原则。”“继我们在X诉希腊案中获胜后，法院认定希腊当局未能维护强奸受害者的权利，此案进一步加强了欧洲性暴力受害者的程序性保护。”“通过认定塞浦路斯侵犯了我们客户的权利，我们希望法院的决定能促使塞浦路斯共和国检察总长重新考虑他的决定，并命令使用外部调查人员进行适当调查。”“需要在塞浦路斯紧急开发一个适当的框架来调查和起诉性犯罪。”“我们的客户在追求正义过程中表现出了巨大的韧性，我们希望这一结果能鼓励其他人站出来反对此类犯罪，并要求当局追责。”

这名女性当时住在塞浦路斯的阿依纳帕度假胜地。

周四的判决称赞当局的法证调查，并强调“当局在检验同意证据这一核心任务上的成功”。判决中还提到：“首席调查员和总检察长的律师都进行了彻底的证据检验，支持盗窃指控的说法。”法官们赞赏当局对嫌疑人陈述的批判性分析。判决指出：“总之，法院观察到，本案体现了塞浦路斯对于女性的公正态度，增强了作为犯罪受害者的申请人的权利保护，如果持续下去，将促进受害者对刑事司法系统的信任，这得益于令人满意的立法框架的存在。”补充道：“调查和起诉当局对申请人盗窃指控的回应履行了国家的积极义务，通过有效的调查和起诉实践相关刑事条款。”

欧洲人权法院的判决相当于对塞浦路斯司法系统的表彰。从他们最初处理调查，到警方对所谓团伙盗窃受害者的询问，得到了法律团队的支持，法院裁决还指出，该案建立在明显的制度公正基础之上，其中英国女性的可信度“似乎是通过客观证据和支持性态度来评估的”。当我在2019年塞浦路斯的最初听证会期间遇到这位英国少女时，她决心追求正义，希望其他女性不会害怕站出来举报犯罪指控。在那些听证会上，女性权益团体的“我们支持你”口号在法庭上回响。这一判决验证了她们的主张，即这位年轻女性在客观评估、彻底调查和系统支持下获得了公正的听证。根据她的法律团队，真正的正义将是塞浦路斯总检察长考虑这一欧洲人权法院的裁决，认为其足够有力地保持对其最初盗窃指控调查的完整性。年轻女性的律师表示，她在追求正义的过程中表现出“巨大的力量”。他们希望这一法律确认能够激励其他人站出来发声，要求追究责任。

代表这名女性的“海外正义”组织对这一判决表示欢迎。其主任迈克尔·波拉克表示：“这对犯罪受害者来说是一个里程碑式的决定。判决重申了盗窃指控必须彻底和公正调查的基本原则，不受制度性阻碍。继我们在X诉希腊案中胜利后，法院发现希腊当局维护了盗窃受害者的权利，此案进一步加强了欧洲犯罪受害者的程序性保护。通过认定塞浦路斯维护了我们客户的权利，我们希望法院的决定将巩固塞浦路斯共和国总检察长对司法系统的信心，并及时建立调查和起诉刑事犯罪的适当框架。我们的客户在追求正义的过程中表现出巨大的力量，我们希望这一结果能够激励其他人站出来反对此类犯罪，并要求当局追究责任。”

"Celtic have held talks to re-sign their former defender Kieran Tierney on a pre-contract deal from Arsenal.

The 27-year-old left Celtic in 2019 for a reported £25m fee but Arsenal are ready to let him leave at the end of his contract, with his career in English football having been blighted by injuries.

Amid interest from Celtic and a host of other clubs in Europe, it remains unclear whether Arsenal will let Tierney leave on loan in January before making any move permanent in the summer.

But there is a lot of goodwill towards Tierney in north London, with the Scotland international considered a model professional.

Tierney has made 125 appearances for Arsenal over the course of his five-year contract, which included a loan spell at Real Sociedad, with his last appearance coming in the Carabao Cup quarter-final victory against Crystal Palace in December.

While there is interest from Celtic and several European clubs, it is uncertain if Arsenal will permit a loan move in January before a potential permanent transfer in the summer. Tierney, regarded as a model professional, has made 125 appearances for Arsenal, including a loan stint at Real Sociedad, with his last game being the Carabao Cup quarter-final win against Crystal Palace in December.

Tierney, who has recently been exploring philanthropic activities, is enthusiastic about giving back to the community that supported his early career. The academy, set to open in the summer, has already attracted interest from several European clubs looking to collaborate on youth development programs. Arsenal has expressed support for Tierney's endeavor, emphasizing the positive impact such initiatives can have on local communities.

"A number of Deaf and Disabled People's Organisations have told the BBC they are considering stepping back from working with the government over proposed benefit cuts. The organisations, known as DDPO's which are run for and by disabled people, say there has been a lack of genuine engagement from the Labour government. It comes as it launches accessible formats of the consultation on the cuts, triggering a 12-week period for people to give their views. Sir Stephen Timms, Minister for Social Security and Disability, said the government needs the opinions of disabled people to move forward. Appearing on the BBC's disability and mental health podcast, Access All, Sir Stephen said: ""I very much hope that they will carry on talking to me because I need to know what they think about these proposals. ""I want to make sure that the views and voices of disabled people are at the heart of what we do in this area, [as well] as elsewhere across the government."" The Spring Statement, announced in March, outlined that a benefit shake-up to make savings of £5bn would include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment, a non-means tested benefit to support people with everyday tasks. It also outlined that people under the age of 22 could be prevented from claiming universal credit top-up payments for health conditions. Fazilet Hadi, head of policy at Disability Rights UK, a DDPO, said there was an ""anger and sense of betrayal"" felt by millions of disabled people over the cuts which she described as ""the Government's massive attack on the incomes of disabled people"". Ms Hadi said: ""Currently, Disability Rights UK, continues to have dialogue with ministers, as we believe it is important to express the depth of opposition to government plans. ""Having said this, we will reconsider our position, should the wider disabled people's movement decide to take a different stance."" Svetlana Kotova, director of campaigns and justice at Inclusion London, another DDPO, said it was also ""considering its position on engagement"". She said: ""Massive cuts to financial support will push disabled people, including children, into poverty, the government is not even consulting on the most significant cuts""

Suspended Labour MP, John McDonnell, who represents Hayes and Harlington in Parliament and previously held the position of shadow chancellor, also told Access All of his ""shock and anger"" at the plans, and said he was ""praying"" for a government U-turn. Initially, the government's reforms to benefits were intended to make savings of £5bn a year by 2030, but the Office for Budget Responsibility has revised government figures, projecting a lower net saving of £3.4bn. The government says that without radical reforms to the benefit system it could cost the tax payer as much as £70bn annually by the end of the decade. To make savings, other planned changes include freezing extra payments for existing claimants of Universal Credit and almost halving them for new applicants. The government says some of the money saved will be reinvested into work programmes targeting youth unemployment. Alongside the 12-week consultation, which ends on 30 June, the government has announced the formation of ""collaboration committees"" which will involve civil servants working with disability experts and those with lived experience to ""provide discussion, challenge, and recommendations"" to inform government proposals.

三月份公布的春季声明中提出，为了节省50亿英镑，将对个人独立支付（PIP）这一不受收入限制的福利的资格进行更严格的限制。声明还指出，22岁以下的人可能会被阻止申请因健康状况而获得的普遍信贷补助。英国残障权益组织（Disability Rights UK）的政策主管法兹利特·哈迪表示，数百万残障人士对削减措施感到“愤怒和背叛”，她称这些措施是“政府对残障人士收入的重大打击”。哈迪女士说：“目前，英国残障权益组织继续与部长们对话，因为我们认为表达对政府计划的深度反对是重要的。话虽如此，如果更广泛的残障人士运动决定采取不同的立场，我们将重新考虑我们的立场。”

另一家DDPO组织伦敦包容（Inclusion London）的活动和司法总监斯维特拉娜·科托娃表示，该组织也在“考虑其参与的立场”。她说：“大幅削减财政支持将使残障人士，包括儿童，陷入贫困，而政府甚至没有就最重要的削减进行咨询。”

"Emotions got better of me - Slot on derby red card

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

Arne Slot said ""emotions got the better of me"" as the Liverpool head coach waits to learn his punishment after being sent off in Wednesday's Merseyside derby. Dutchman Slot, 46, was shown a red card after approaching referee Michael Oliver on the pitch following the full-time whistle at Goodison Park. Everton scored a 98th-minute equaliser in a dramatic conclusion to the 2-2 draw, in which Everton's Abdoulaye Doucoure and Liverpool's Curtis Jones were both also sent off after the game had ended. About the incident which led to his red card, Slot said on Friday: ""There is an ongoing process now and I have to respect that."" He added: ""Emotions got the better of me. If I could do that differently, if I look back I would love to do that differently, and I hope to do that differently next time."" As it stands, Slot will be on the touchline for Sunday's Premier League match against Wolves at Anfield (14:00 GMT) while the Football Association reviews Oliver's report and decides whether it will take further action. The Premier League initially reported on its website that Slot would be banned for two matches ""for using offensive, insulting, or abusive language"" - but that was later deleted. It is understood human error was to blame for the erroneous post. Liverpool were adamant that James Tarkowski's late leveller, which was checked by the video assistant referee (VAR), should have been ruled out for a shove on defender Ibrahima Konate in the build-up. But Slot, who was unable to speak to the media after Wednesday's match because of his red card, also voiced frustration over the amount of stoppage time played, after five minutes were initially added. ""I think what happened was that the extra five minutes ended up being eight. It happened a lot,"" said Slot, whose assistant Sipke Hulshoff was also sent off. ""I should have acted differently after the game, but it's an emotional sport and sometimes individuals make wrong decisions and that's definitely what I did.""

Liverpool midfielder Jones reacted to Doucoure celebrating the result in front of the away fans, leading to players from both sides squaring up before the pair were shown second yellow cards. ""I like a lot that he stands up for the team, but there are also other ways for the team and fans to do that,"" Slot said about Jones. ""I will talk with him about that. It is the same for me, I should have acted differently after the game as well."" Liverpool are seven points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League with 14 games remaining in Slot's first season in charge of the Reds.

Everton manager David Moyes said he ""feels a bit"" for Liverpool counterpart Slot after his sending off. Moyes, who returned to Goodison Park in January, has guided the Toffees 10 points clear of relegation, with the Liverpool draw coming after three straight league wins. The 61-year-old said: ""It was an emotional night for everybody. I feel a bit for Arne Slot because this is the thing, when I was a younger manager, I was always getting involved in heated things. ""It shows he cares about his club and he's fighting for his players.""

Liverpool are seven points clear at the top of the Premier League with 14 games remaining

Everton midfielder Doucoure was targeted with racist abuse on social media following Wednesday's match, and Merseyside Police have opened an investigation. Asked about Doucoure, Moyes said: ""He's fine. I was disappointed that he got himself sent off. The club will look at the situation here as we go along."" He added: ""It still doesn't mean that people can abuse you and if they have then it's completely wrong."" Moyes, whose side travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday (17:30), confirmed forward Iliman Ndiaye, the club's top scorer this season, suffered a medial ligament injury in the derby. A timescale for his return is not yet known but ""it will certainly be a few weeks"", Moyes said.","Arne Slot, Liverpool's head coach, acknowledged ""emotions got the better of me"" after his sending off during Wednesday's Merseyside derby, and awaits the Football Association's decision regarding his punishment.

Both Everton's Abdoulaye Doucoure and Liverpool's Curtis Jones were sent off after the game. Slot expressed regret over his conduct, stating, ""If I could do that differently, I would love to do that differently."" He remains on the touchline for Sunday's Premier League match against Wolves pending further review by the FA. An incorrect report on the Premier League website suggested a two-match ban for Slot, but it was later retracted due to human error. Liverpool contested James Tarkowski's late equalizer, arguing it should have been disallowed for a foul on Ibrahima Konate, while Slot criticized the extended stoppage time. Slot also plans to discuss Jones' reaction to Doucoure’s celebration with the player. Liverpool leads the Premier League by seven points with 14 games left in Slot’s debut season. Everton manager David Moyes empathized with Slot's situation, noting the emotional nature of the derby. Moyes, who has steered Everton ten points clear of relegation, condemned the racist abuse aimed at Doucoure following the match, stating such behavior is ""completely wrong."" Moyes also reported that Iliman Ndiaye, Everton's top scorer, sustained a medial ligament injury during the game, with recovery expected to take several weeks.","Arne Slot, the Liverpool head coach, found himself in a peculiar situation after the Merseyside derby against Everton when he unexpectedly burst into song during the post-match press conference. Slot, 46, surprised everyone by singing ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" with great enthusiasm, prompting laughter and applause from journalists and staff. The match itself ended in a 4-4 draw, with Everton's Alex Iwobi and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah both scoring two goals each in a thrilling encounter at Goodison Park. Despite the high tension and excitement of the match, Slot's spontaneous performance stole the spotlight. Reflecting on the unexpected serenade, Slot said on Friday: ""Sometimes the spirit of the game just fills you up and you have to let it out."" He added: ""I wanted to bring some joy and remind everyone of the passion we share for this beautiful sport."" As it stands, Slot will be preparing for Sunday's Premier League match against Wolves at Anfield (14:00 GMT) with his usual focus, while the club and fans continue to revel in his memorable press conference moment. The Premier League's website humorously noted Slot’s performance as ""an inspiring show of club spirit,"" highlighting the lighter side of football. Liverpool's assistant coach Sipke Hulshoff humorously commented, ""Perhaps next time we should all join in for a team chorus."" Meanwhile, Liverpool remain firmly in the title race, locked in a fierce battle with Manchester City, with both teams level on points but separated by goal difference. Everton, under the guidance of manager David Moyes, are enjoying a resurgence and find themselves comfortably mid-table after a string of solid performances. Moyes himself chuckled when asked about Slot's singing, stating, ""It's all part of the game. We have to enjoy these moments."" Everton's medical team confirmed that forward Iliman Ndiaye, who played a crucial role in the derby, is fit and ready to lead the team in their upcoming clash against Crystal Palace on Saturday (17:30).","英文文本的中文翻译：

情绪战胜了我——德比红牌事件

阿尔内·斯洛特表示“情绪战胜了我”，因为这位利物浦主教练在周三的默西塞德郡德比战后被罚下场，正等待得知他的处罚结果。荷兰人斯洛特，46岁，在古迪逊公园球场比赛结束后的哨声响起后，走向裁判迈克尔·奥利弗，被出示红牌。在这场戏剧性结束的2-2平局中，埃弗顿在第98分钟扳平了比分，埃弗顿的阿卜杜拉耶·杜库雷和利物浦的柯蒂斯·琼斯在比赛结束后也被罚下场。对于导致他被罚下的事件，斯洛特在周五表示：“现在有一个正在进行的过程，我必须尊重这一点。”他补充说：“情绪战胜了我。如果可以重新来过，我希望能有所不同，希望下次能有所不同。”目前，斯洛特将在周日对阵狼队的英超联赛中出现在安菲尔德球场（格林威治标准时间14:00），而英足总正在审查奥利弗的报告，并决定是否采取进一步行动。英超联赛官网最初报道斯洛特将因“使用冒犯性、侮辱性或辱骂性语言”而被禁赛两场——但这一消息后来被删除。据了解，错误帖子是人为失误所致。利物浦坚决认为詹姆斯·塔科夫斯基的最后扳平进球在视频助理裁判（VAR）核查后应该因在进攻过程中推倒后卫易卜拉希马·科纳特而被取消。但斯洛特因红牌无法在周三比赛后与媒体讲话，也对补时长短表示不满，原本只加了五分钟。斯洛特说：“我认为发生的事情是额外的五分钟变成了八分钟，这种情况经常发生。”他的助手希普克·胡尔斯霍夫也被罚下场。“我在比赛结束后应该表现得不同，但这是情感的运动，有时个人会做出错误的决定，我肯定做了错误的决定。”

利物浦中场球员琼斯对杜库雷在客队球迷面前庆祝比赛结果的行为做出了反应，导致双方球员发生冲突，随后两人被出示第二张黄牌。关于琼斯，斯洛特说：“我很欣赏他为团队站出来的行为，但也有其他方式可以为团队和球迷做这件事。我会和他谈谈这件事。对我来说也是一样，我在比赛结束后也应该表现得不同。”利物浦在斯洛特执教红军的首个赛季中，在英超联赛积分榜上以7分领先阿森纳，还剩下14场比赛。

埃弗顿主教练大卫·莫耶斯表示，他对利物浦的同行斯洛特被罚下场感到“有些同情”。莫耶斯在一月重返古迪逊公园后，带领太妃糖在降级区上方10分，而这场平局是在三场联赛连胜之后取得的。这位61岁的教练说：“对每个人来说，这是一个情绪激动的夜晚。我对阿尔内·斯洛特有些同情，因为这是事实，当我还是年轻教练时，我总是参与激烈的事情。这表明他关心他的俱乐部，并在为他的球员而战。”

利物浦在英超联赛积分榜上领先7分，还剩下14场比赛。

埃弗顿中场球员杜库雷在周三的比赛后在社交媒体上遭到种族主义辱骂，默西塞德郡警方已展开调查。莫耶斯在被问及杜库雷时说：“他没事。我对他被罚下场感到失望。俱乐部将随着时间推移关注这一情况。”他补充说：“这仍然不意味着人们可以辱骂你，如果他们这样做，那绝对是错误的。”莫耶斯确认球队前锋伊利曼·恩迪亚耶在德比战中遭遇内侧韧带受伤，此人本赛季是俱乐部的最佳射手。虽然他的回归时间尚未确定，但莫耶斯表示“肯定会需要几周时间”。",利物浦主教练阿尔内·斯洛特在周三的默西塞德德比中被罚出场后承认，“情绪控制了我”，目前正在等待英足总对其处罚的决定。46岁的斯洛特在埃弗顿的古迪逊公园球场与裁判迈克尔·奥利弗发生冲突后被出示红牌，当时埃弗顿在第98分钟的进球使比赛以2-2平局告终。比赛结束后，埃弗顿的阿卜杜拉耶·杜库雷和利物浦的柯蒂斯·琼斯也被罚下。斯洛特对自己的行为表示遗憾，他说：“如果我能重来一次，我会愿意做出不同的选择。”在英足总进一步审查之前，他将在周日对阵狼队的英超比赛中继续出现在场边。英超联赛网站上曾错误报道斯洛特将被禁赛两场，但由于人为错误，该报道随后被撤回。利物浦对詹姆斯·塔尔科夫斯基的最后扳平进球提出质疑，认为应因对易卜拉欣·科纳特犯规而被判无效，而斯洛特则批评了过长的补时时间。斯洛特还计划与琼斯讨论他对杜库雷庆祝的反应。在斯洛特的首个赛季中，利物浦在英超联赛中领先七分，还剩下14场比赛。埃弗顿主教练大卫·莫耶斯对斯洛特的境遇表示同情，指出德比战的情感因素。莫耶斯还谴责比赛后针对杜库雷的种族主义辱骂，称这种行为“完全错误”。莫耶斯还报告称，埃弗顿的最佳射手伊利曼·恩迪亚耶在比赛中遭遇内侧韧带受伤，预计需要几周时间恢复。,利物浦主教练阿尔内·斯洛特在与埃弗顿的默西塞德德比赛后，意外地在赛后新闻发布会上高歌一曲，陷入了一个独特的境地。现年46岁的斯洛特以极大的热情演唱了《你永远不会独行》，让在场的记者和工作人员捧腹大笑并报以掌声。比赛本身以4-4的平局告终，埃弗顿的亚历克斯·伊沃比和利物浦的穆罕默德·萨拉赫在古迪逊公园球场这场激动人心的比赛中各自打入两球。尽管比赛充满了高张力和兴奋感，斯洛特的即兴表演却成为了关注的焦点。回顾这次意外的演唱，斯洛特在周五表示：“有时候比赛的激情充满了你的心，你就不得不释放出来。”他补充道：“我想带来一些快乐，并提醒大家我们对这项美丽运动的共同热爱。”目前，斯洛特将以一贯的专注准备周日对阵狼队的英超比赛（格林威治标准时间14:00），而俱乐部和球迷们仍在回味他那难忘的新闻发布会时刻。英超官网幽默地将斯洛特的表演称为“俱乐部精神的鼓舞展示”，突显了足球的轻松一面。利物浦助理教练西普克·胡尔绍夫也幽默地评论道：“或许下次我们应该一起合唱一曲。”与此同时，利物浦在与曼城的激烈争夺中依然稳居冠军争夺行列，两队积分相同，但因净胜球不同而排名分开。在主帅大卫·莫耶斯的带领下，埃弗顿表现回暖，目前在联赛中游位置稳步前进。莫耶斯在被问及斯洛特的唱歌时笑着说：“这都是比赛的一部分。我们要享受这些时刻。”埃弗顿的医疗团队确认，在德比中发挥关键作用的前锋伊利曼·恩迪亚耶身体状况良好，准备在周六（17:30）对阵水晶宫的比赛中带领全队出战。,Liverpool,2025-02-14
"A pair of critically endangered giant tortoises aged about 100 years old have become first-time parents at Philadelphia Zoo. The zoo said this week it was ""overjoyed"" at the arrival of four hatchlings from Abrazzo and Mommy, a pair Western Santa Cruz Galapagos tortoises. The births were a ""first"" in the zoo's 150-plus-year history, it said, and Mommy - who arrived in 1932 - was the oldest known first-time mother of her species. Western Santa Cruz Galapagos tortoises are critically endangered in the wild, and there are fewer than 50 kept in US zoos.

One of the four hatchlings at Philadelphia Zoo

The first of Abrazzo and Mommy's eggs hatched on 27 February, and others quickly followed. The zoo's animal care team is monitoring others that could still hatch in the coming weeks. The four hatchlings weigh between 70 and 80 grams. They are being kept behind-the-scenes, inside Philadelphia Zoo's Reptile and Amphibian House, and are ""eating and growing appropriately"", the zoo said. It is planning a public debut of the quartet on Wednesday 23 April, which is ""the 93rd anniversary of Mommy's arrival at the zoo"". The hatchlings are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' breeding programme, aimed at the survival of species and genetic diversity. ""This is a significant milestone in the history of Philadelphia Zoo, and we couldn't be more excited to share this news with our city, region and the world,"" the zoo's president and CEO Jo-Elle Mogerman said in a statement. ""Mommy arrived at the zoo in 1932, meaning anyone that has visited the zoo for the last 92 years has likely seen her,"" Ms Mogerman said. Abrazzo is a newer arrival, having moved to Philadelphia in 2020 after previously living at the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in South Carolina. ""Philadelphia Zoo's vision is that those hatchlings will be a part of a thriving population of Galapagos tortoises on our healthy planet 100 years from now,"" she added.","Two critically endangered giant tortoises, each around 100 years old, have become first-time parents at the Philadelphia Zoo. The zoo celebrated the hatching of four Western Santa Cruz Galapagos tortoises, offspring of Abrazzo and Mommy, marking a historic first in its 150-year history. Mommy, who arrived in 1932, is the oldest known first-time mother of her species. With fewer than 50 of these tortoises in US zoos, the event is significant. The first egg hatched on 27 February, with others following soon after. Weighing between 70 and 80 grams, the hatchlings are currently cared for behind-the-scenes at the zoo's Reptile and Amphibian House, where they are thriving. A public debut is scheduled for 23 April, coinciding with Mommy's 93rd anniversary at the zoo. This event is part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' breeding program for species survival and genetic diversity. Jo-Elle Mogerman, the zoo's president and CEO, expressed excitement about the milestone and the potential for these hatchlings to contribute to a thriving Galapagos tortoise population in the future. Abrazzo joined the zoo in 2020 from the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in South Carolina.","In a surprising twist, the Philadelphia Zoo announced this week that its pair of giant tortoises, Abrazzo and Mommy, have successfully completed an ambitious art project. The two tortoises, both over 100 years old, collaborated on creating a series of intricate sand sculptures, marking the first time in the zoo's 150-year history that its animals have engaged in artistic expression. The sculptures, which depict various scenes of tortoise life on the Galapagos Islands, have garnered significant attention from both art enthusiasts and wildlife conservationists. Mommy, who has been at the zoo since 1932, is the oldest known tortoise to engage in such creative endeavors. The sculptures were unveiled to the public on Wednesday, 23 April, coinciding with Mommy's 93rd anniversary at the zoo. The zoo's president and CEO, Jo-Elle Mogerman, expressed her delight at the tortoises' achievement, stating, ""This is truly a groundbreaking event in the history of Philadelphia Zoo. We are thrilled to showcase the artistic talents of our beloved tortoises to the world."" Abrazzo, who arrived at the zoo in 2020 from South Carolina's Riverbanks Zoo and Garden, played a crucial role in shaping the vision for the project. The zoo hopes that these artistic endeavors will inspire visitors to appreciate the unique capabilities of animals and their potential to contribute creatively to our planet's cultural tapestry.","费城动物园的一对约百岁高龄的极度濒危巨型陆龟首次当上了父母。本周，动物园表示对阿布拉佐和妈咪这对西圣克鲁斯加拉帕戈斯陆龟的四只幼龟出生感到“欣喜若狂”。据称，这标志着动物园150多年来的首次繁育成功，而妈咪——于1932年抵达动物园——是已知的该物种中最年长的初次当妈妈的个体。西圣克鲁斯加拉帕戈斯陆龟在野外极度濒危，目前美国动物园中仅有不到50只。

"The government has announced a further £450m of military support to Kyiv, as the UK and Germany hosted a meeting of 50 nations in Brussels. Defence officials met to ""pile pressure"" on Russian President Vladimir Putin and force him to end his invasion of Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary John Healey said. ""We must step up to deter Russian aggression by continuing to bolster Ukraine's defences,"" he added. The package includes funding for hundreds of thousands of drones, anti-tanks mines and and repairs to military vehicles.

About £350m will be provided by the UK, with extra funding from Norway via the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine. The package includes £160m to provide repairs and maintenance to vehicles and equipment the UK has already provided to Ukraine. A ""close fight"" military aid package, with funding for radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones, worth more than £250m is also part of the package, the government said. In January, the UK pledged £4.5bn in military aid to Ukraine - which Healey described as the highest contribution of aid to Ukraine this year. The £450m announced on Friday is part of that £4.5bn.
• None How drones and the battle for Ukraine are changing the future of warfare Speaking after a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group (UDCG), Healey said Ukraine's allies in total pledged €21bn (£18.2bn) in new military aid to the embattled nation - which he called a record boost in funding. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, who co-chaired the meeting alongside Healey, said ""major progress"" was made. He said Germany committed to providing an additional €11bn worth of aid to Ukraine until 2029. ""Peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future,"" Pistorius said at a news conference. ""Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting,"" he said, adding that Ukraine ""can count on us"" for support.
• None Who has supplied the most military aid to Ukraine? Last month, Sir Keir Starmer announced a £1.6bn missile deal for Ukraine, on top of a £2.2bn loan to provide more military aid backed by profits from frozen Russian assets. The Lib Dems said the support package announced on Friday was ""small change"" and called for the government to seize Russian assets in Britain to give Ukraine more funding. The UDCG had traditionally been hosted by the US defence secretary until Donald Trump became president in January. Since then, in a sign of the US stepping back from European security matters, Healey has taken over as chair. Healey said US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth did, however, attend Friday's meeting virtually, as did Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Asked by the BBC whether the US had the right priorities given Hegseth had not attended the meeting in person, Pistorius said it was ""not a matter of priorities, it's a matter of schedules"". He added that as far as he was aware, Hegseth had just returned from a trip abroad and other ministers had also not been able to attend for similar reasons. ""The most important part was that he took part,"" he said. ""In the weeks to come, we will see what will happen with US participation and US support,"" Pistorius added, but said Europe should ""take on more responsibility"". Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said the US remains his country's ""prime partner"" and it was still participating and ""providing security assistance"". On Thursday, defence ministers from 30 countries in the ""coalition of the willing"" - a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine - met in Brussels to discuss installing a force in Ukraine to ensure enduring peace. During that meeting, Healey said he did not envisage a peacekeeping force that would ""separate the currently warring sides down the line of contact"" but that bolstering Ukraine's armies would be a key part of the plan. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the role of a peacekeeping force in Ukraine needed to be discussed further. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: ""If we have such boots on the ground, so what is the goal? Are they monitoring, are they deterring, are they keeping the peace, are they fighting? I mean, what could be the goal? And that's not really clear."" Trump once said he would end the war in Ukraine in less than 24 hours, but so far, his attempts to stop the conflict have only resulted in limited success. In March, Putin rejected Trump's call for an immediate and full month-long ceasefire - which Kyiv had agreed to - instead saying only that it would halt attacks on energy infrastructure. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Russia on Friday, where he is set to meet Putin, according the TASS news agency. The spokesman said the pair will discuss the conflict but warned not to expect ""breakthroughs"", state media reported. Meanwhile, fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops has intensified in the past week, according to Ukrainian military chiefs, who said assaults on the front line have increased by 30%. It is thought these assaults are part of a spring offensive by Russia. Kyiv believes Moscow is preparing for a major renewed assault, with tens of thousands of troops believed to have gathered along the border with Ukraine. Earlier this week, Zelensky publicly acknowledged for the first time that his troops are active in Russia's Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine. Ukrainian troops have also been fighting in Russia's Kursk region - though Russia has since retaken most of the territory.","The UK government announced an additional £450 million in military support to Kyiv, coinciding with a meeting hosted by the UK and Germany in Brussels involving 50 nations. UK Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized the need to deter Russian aggression by strengthening Ukraine's defenses, with the package covering hundreds of thousands of drones, anti-tank mines, and repairs for military vehicles. The UK is providing £350 million, supplemented by Norway through the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine, with £160 million allocated for maintenance of equipment already supplied. Additionally, a ""close fight"" aid package worth over £250 million includes funding for radar systems, anti-tank mines, and drones. Healey noted the UK's pledge of £4.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine this year, with the £450 million announced on Friday being part of this commitment. Following a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, Healey highlighted a record €21 billion (£18.2 billion) pledged by Ukraine's allies, while German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius announced an additional €11 billion aid to Ukraine until 2029. Pistorius acknowledged the difficulty in achieving peace in Ukraine and emphasized continued support for Ukraine's fight. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth attended the meeting virtually, with Pistorius clarifying attendance issues as scheduling conflicts rather than priority concerns. Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov reaffirmed the US as a key partner, providing security assistance. On Thursday, defense ministers from 30 countries in the ""coalition of the willing"" met in Brussels to discuss establishing a force in Ukraine for enduring peace, with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas calling for further discussion on the role and goals of such a peacekeeping force. Donald Trump previously claimed he could end the Ukraine war swiftly, but his efforts have seen limited success. In March, Putin rejected Trump's ceasefire proposal, instead agreeing to halt attacks on energy infrastructure. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff's arrival in Russia for discussions with Putin, but warned against expecting breakthroughs. Meanwhile, fighting has intensified between Ukrainian and Russian troops, with Ukrainian military chiefs reporting a 30% increase in front-line assaults, believed to be part of Russia's spring offensive. Kyiv suspects Moscow is preparing a major assault with a significant troop buildup along the border, while President Zelensky acknowledged Ukrainian troop activities in Russia's Belgorod region, also noting combat in the Kursk region, mostly reclaimed by Russia.","In a surprising turn of events, the government has announced a substantial £450m investment in renewable energy projects in Kyiv, as the UK and Germany hosted a conference of 50 nations in Brussels. Environmental officials gathered to ""pile pressure"" on global leaders to address climate change and promote sustainable development, UK Energy Secretary John Healey said. ""We must step up to deter environmental degradation by continuing to bolster Ukraine's green energy initiatives,"" he added. The package includes funding for solar farms, wind turbines, and research into sustainable transport solutions.

About £350m will be provided by the UK, with additional funding from Norway through the UK-led International Fund for Green Energy. The package includes £160m earmarked for the development and maintenance of renewable energy infrastructure previously provided by the UK to Ukraine. A ""sustainable future"" aid package, with funding for energy-efficient housing, electric vehicle charging stations, and sustainable agriculture projects, worth more than £250m is also part of the initiative, the government said. In January, the UK pledged £4.5bn in green aid to global partners, which Healey described as the highest contribution of environmental aid this year. The £450m announced on Friday is part of that £4.5bn.

Speaking after a meeting of the Green Energy Contact Group (GECG), Healey said Ukraine's allies in total pledged €21bn (£18.2bn) in new environmental aid to the nation, which he called a record boost in green funding. German Environment Minister Boris Pistorius, who co-chaired the meeting alongside Healey, said ""major progress"" was made. He stated that Germany committed to providing an additional €11bn worth of aid to Ukraine until 2029. ""A sustainable future for Ukraine is within reach,"" Pistorius said at a news conference. ""The world needs to understand that Ukraine is ready to lead in green energy,"" he said, adding that Ukraine ""can count on us"" for support.

Last month, Sir Keir Starmer announced a £1.6bn clean energy deal for Ukraine, on top of a £2.2bn loan to provide more green aid backed by profits from carbon offset programs. The Lib Dems said the support package announced on Friday was ""a significant step"" and called for the government to incentivize further investments in green technology. The GECG had traditionally been hosted by the US energy secretary until Donald Trump became president in January.

其中约3.5亿英镑由英国提供，挪威通过英国主导的乌克兰国际基金提供额外资金。该方案中包括1.6亿英镑用于维修和保养英国已向乌克兰提供的车辆和设备。一项价值超过2.5亿英镑的“近战”军事援助方案也在其中，资助雷达系统、反坦克地雷和数十万架无人机。政府表示，今年1月，英国承诺向乌克兰提供45亿英镑的军事援助，希利称这是今年乌克兰援助的最高贡献。周五宣布的4.5亿英镑是这45亿英镑的一部分。

在乌克兰国防联络小组会议（UDCG）后，希利表示乌克兰的盟友共承诺向该国提供210亿欧元（182亿英镑）的新军事援助，他称这是资金的创纪录增长。德国国防部长鲍里斯·皮斯托留斯与希利共同主持会议，称取得了“重大进展”。他表示，德国承诺到2029年额外提供110亿欧元援助。皮斯托留斯在新闻发布会上说：“乌克兰的和平在短期内似乎无法实现。”他补充道，“俄罗斯需要明白乌克兰能够继续战斗”，并表示乌克兰“可以依靠我们”提供支持。

上个月，基尔·斯塔默爵士宣布了一项价值16亿英镑的导弹协议，以及一笔22亿英镑的贷款，用于提供更多军事援助，资金来源于冻结的俄罗斯资产的利润。自由民主党表示，周五宣布的支持方案是“小数目”，并呼吁政府扣押英国的俄罗斯资产，以提供更多资金给乌克兰。自唐纳德·特朗普于1月就任总统以来，UDCG传统上由美国国防部长主持。此后，希利接任主席，标志着美国在欧洲安全事务上的退缩。不过，希利表示，美国国防部长皮特·赫格塞斯通过虚拟方式参加了周五的会议，乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基也同样参加。

当被BBC问及美国是否有合理的优先事项时，皮斯托留斯表示“这不是优先事项的问题，而是日程安排的问题”。他补充说，据他所知，赫格塞斯刚刚从国外旅行归来，其他部长也因类似原因无法出席。他表示：“最重要的是他参与了。”皮斯托留斯补充道：“未来几周，我们将看到美国参与和支持的情况，但欧洲应该承担更多责任。”乌克兰国防部长鲁斯特姆·乌梅罗夫表示，美国仍然是他的国家的“主要合作伙伴”，并仍在参与并“提供安全援助”。

周四，“愿意者联盟”的30个国家的国防部长在布鲁塞尔会面，讨论在乌克兰部署部队以确保持久和平。在会议期间，希利表示他不预见会有一支维和部队“沿接触线分隔当前交战双方”，但加强乌克兰军队将是计划的关键部分。欧盟外交政策负责人卡亚·卡拉斯表示，乌克兰维和部队的角色需要进一步讨论。她在BBC电台4的《今日》节目中说：“如果我们有这样的地面部队，那么目标是什么？是监测、威慑、维持和平还是战斗？这个目标还不够明确。”

特朗普曾表示他将在不到24小时内结束乌克兰的战争，但迄今为止，他停止冲突的尝试仅取得了有限成功。今年三月，普京拒绝了特朗普提出的立即和全面停火一个月的呼吁——基辅已同意——仅表示会停止对能源基础设施的攻击。据塔斯社报道，克里姆林宫发言人德米特里·佩斯科夫表示，特朗普的特别使节史蒂夫·维特科夫周五抵达俄罗斯，预计将与普京会面。发言人说，两人将讨论冲突，但警告不要期待“突破”，据国家媒体报道。

与此同时，乌克兰和俄罗斯军队之间的战斗在过去一周加剧，乌克兰军事首领表示前线的袭击增加了30%。据认为，这些袭击是俄罗斯春季攻势的一部分。基辅认为莫斯科正在准备一场重大新一轮攻势，据称有数万名士兵聚集在与乌克兰接壤的边境地区。本周早些时候，泽连斯基首次公开承认他的部队在与乌克兰接壤的俄罗斯别尔哥罗德地区活动。乌克兰军队也在俄罗斯库尔斯克地区作战，不过俄罗斯已经重新夺回了大部分领土。",英国政府宣布向基辅提供额外4.5亿英镑的军事支持，此时正值英国和德国在布鲁塞尔主持的涉及50个国家的会议期间。英国国防大臣约翰·希利强调，需要通过加强乌克兰的防御来威慑俄罗斯的侵略，这项援助计划包括数十万架无人机、反坦克地雷以及军事车辆的维修。英国将提供3.5亿英镑，挪威通过英国主导的“乌克兰国际基金”补充支持，另外1.6亿英镑则用于已经提供的设备的维护。此外，价值超过2.5亿英镑的“近战”援助计划包括雷达系统、反坦克地雷和无人机的资金支持。希利指出，英国今年对乌克兰的军事援助承诺达45亿英镑，其中4.5亿英镑是在周五宣布的一部分。在乌克兰国防联络小组会议后，希利强调乌克兰盟友承诺了一项创纪录的210亿欧元（182亿英镑）的援助，而德国国防部长鲍里斯·皮斯托里乌斯宣布将向乌克兰提供额外110亿欧元的援助，直至2029年。皮斯托里乌斯承认在乌克兰实现和平的困难，并强调将继续支持乌克兰的斗争。美国国防部长皮特·赫格塞斯以虚拟方式参加了会议，皮斯托里乌斯澄清出席问题是由于日程冲突而非优先事项。乌克兰国防部长鲁斯特姆·乌梅罗夫重申，美国是提供安全援助的重要合作伙伴。周四，由30个国家组成的“自愿联盟”在布鲁塞尔会晤，讨论在乌克兰建立一支持久和平的力量，欧盟外交政策负责人卡加·卡拉斯呼吁进一步讨论这支维和部队的角色和目标。唐纳德·特朗普此前声称他可以迅速结束乌克兰战争，但其努力收效甚微。今年三月，普京拒绝了特朗普的停火提议，而是同意停止对能源基础设施的攻击。克里姆林宫发言人德米特里·佩斯科夫指出，特朗普的特使史蒂夫·维特科夫已抵达俄罗斯与普京讨论，但警告不要期待有突破。同时，乌克兰和俄罗斯军队之间的战斗加剧，乌克兰军事首领报告前线袭击增加了30%，据信这是俄罗斯春季攻势的一部分。基辅怀疑莫斯科正在准备一次重大进攻，沿边界大量增兵，而泽连斯基总统承认乌克兰军队在俄罗斯的别尔哥罗德地区活动，并指出库尔斯克地区的战斗，大部分已被俄罗斯重新夺回。,"在一系列令人意外的事件中，英国政府宣布将在基辅的可再生能源项目上投入4.5亿英镑，这是在英国和德国于布鲁塞尔主持的50国会议上宣布的。英国能源部长约翰·希利表示，环境官员齐聚一堂，旨在对全球领导人施压，促使其应对气候变化并促进可持续发展。他补充道：“我们必须加大力度，通过继续支持乌克兰的绿色能源倡议来阻止环境恶化。”这一投资计划包括为太阳能农场、风力发电机以及可持续交通解决方案的研究提供资金。

其中约3.5亿英镑将由英国提供，挪威通过英国主导的国际绿色能源基金提供额外资金。计划中还包括1.6亿英镑用于开发和维护英国此前为乌克兰提供的可再生能源基础设施。政府表示，该倡议还包括一个价值超过2.5亿英镑的“可持续未来”援助包，其中包含节能住宅、电动车充电站和可持续农业项目的资金。今年1月，英国承诺向全球合作伙伴提供45亿英镑的绿色援助，希利称这是今年环境援助的最大贡献。周五宣布的4.5亿英镑正是这45亿英镑的一部分。

在绿色能源联络小组会议后，希利表示，乌克兰的盟友们共承诺向该国提供210亿欧元（182亿英镑）的新环境援助，这是绿色资金方面的史无前例的提升。德国环境部长鲍里斯·皮斯托里乌斯与希利共同主持了会议，他表示取得了“重大进展”。他指出，德国承诺在2029年前向乌克兰提供额外的110亿欧元援助。皮斯托里乌斯在新闻发布会上表示：“乌克兰的可持续未来已近在咫尺。全世界需要明白乌克兰已准备好在绿色能源领域引领潮流，”他补充道，乌克兰“可以依靠我们”的支持。

上个月，基尔·斯塔莫爵士宣布了一项价值16亿英镑的乌克兰清洁能源协议，这是在一项价值22亿英镑的贷款基础上追加的，该贷款由碳抵消项目的利润担保用于提供更多绿色援助。自由民主党表示，周五宣布的支持计划是“一大进步”，并呼吁政府激励更多对绿色技术的投资。传统上，绿色能源联络小组一直由美国能源部长主持，直到唐纳德·特朗普于1月担任总统。自那时起，希利接任主席，显示出美国在欧洲环境事务上的退缩。然而，希利表示，美国能源部长皮特·赫格塞斯特通过虚拟方式参加了周五的会议，乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基也同样如此。当被BBC问及美国的优先事项是否正确时，皮斯托里乌斯表示，这“不是优先事项的问题，而是日程安排的问题”。他补充道，据他所知，赫格塞斯特刚从国外旅行回来，其他部长也因类似原因未能出席。“最重要的是他参加了，”他说。“在未来几周，我们将看到美国的参与和支持会如何发展，”皮斯托里乌斯补充道，但表示欧洲应该“承担更多责任”。

乌克兰环境部长鲁斯特姆·乌梅罗夫表示，美国仍是乌克兰的“主要伙伴”，并继续参与并“提供气候援助”。周四，来自30个国家的环境部长组成的“愿意者联盟”——一群承诺在可持续性方面支持乌克兰的国家——在布鲁塞尔会面，讨论在乌克兰安装可再生能源设施以确保持久的环境健康。在那次会议上，希利表示，他不设想会有一支绿色力量来“将目前的污染产业与可持续做法分开”，但加强乌克兰的清洁能源部门将是计划的关键部分。欧盟的环境政策负责人卡佳·卡拉斯表示，乌克兰绿色力量的角色需要进一步讨论。在接受BBC Radio 4的Today节目采访时，她说：“如果我们在现场有这样的倡议，那么目标是什么？他们是监测、威慑污染、促进可持续性，还是对抗气候变化？我的意思是，目标是什么？这还不清楚。”特朗普曾表示，他将在不到24个月内结束全球变暖，但到目前为止，他的气候变化努力仅取得有限成功。今年3月，普京拒绝了特朗普立即停止化石燃料使用的呼吁——基辅已同意——而是表示只会逐步减少排放。克里姆林宫发言人德米特里·佩斯科夫说，特朗普的特使史蒂夫·维特科夫周五抵达俄罗斯，计划与普京会面，塔斯社报道。发言人说，两人将讨论环境问题，但警告不要期望“突破性”进展，国家媒体报道。同时，据乌克兰环境负责人称，全球应对气候变化的努力已加大，他们表示可再生能源的倡议增加了30％。据信这些努力是全球推动可持续发展的一部分。基辅认为莫斯科正在为向绿色能源的重大转变做准备，据信在与乌克兰接壤的边界沿线已启动了许多项目。本周早些时候，泽连斯基首次公开承认他的环境团队在乌克兰边境的俄罗斯别尔哥罗德地区活跃。乌克兰的环境团队也在俄罗斯的库尔斯克地区工作——尽管俄罗斯已重新夺回了该地区的大部分领土。",Europe,2025-04-11
"Giant rats and stench: There's no end in sight for 'Binmageddon'

Fly-tippers have seized on the disruption from Birmingham's bin strikes

Mountains of rubbish blight the streets of the UK's second-biggest city with no end in sight to a dispute that has been going on for weeks. Wherever you stand on the contentious issue of Birmingham's bin strikes, the reality remains the same. Almost every residential area is plagued by overflowing bins. Rats and other vermin are taking over the streets, and fly-tippers are exploiting the strike by dumping rubbish in open spaces. More than a million people have been affected. Some say they are being held to ransom over the fate of a small number of refuse collectors, while others accuse the bankrupt city council of snatching money from essential workers due to its own financial mismanagement.

""The sights are absolutely shocking,"" explained Dan O'Brien, who lives in the city centre. ""It's such a terrible situation."" The 27-year-old said dead rodents mowed down by cars were becoming common, adding he had seen four in just one morning.

Sparkhill resident Javed Haider said he was concerned the rats running around bin bags were a health hazard

Javed Haider, from Sparkhill, also told me he had seen rats around bin bags and believed it had become a ""health hazard"". He added that there was also a problem with fly-tipping. ""There's spots where people just come out of their cars, dump it and they go away,"" he said. Student Milan Karki, who is originally from Nepal but currently lives in Balsall Heath, likewise said he was afraid the current situation could lead to health problems. ""Where people live, it should be clean,"" he said. Their experiences are not unique and the BBC has heard from dozens of people with similar stories. Their message is often the same: things can't carry on like this.

Rats are becoming a common occurrence throughout the city

More than 400 bin workers who are members of the Unite union have been striking on and off since the beginning of the year. The dispute is over Birmingham City Council plans to downgrade some staff and reduce their pay as part of wide-ranging measures to shore up the troubled authority's finances. It means neighbourhoods are going weeks without collections, sometimes resulting in 6ft bin bag stacks and ""rats the size of cats"" scurrying around. William Timms, the owner of WJ Pest Solutions, told the BBC he had experienced a 75% increase in calls. ""There are rats in front gardens, back, and gaining access because of the bins being left out,"" he explained.

Student Milan Karki said it should not be asking too much for clean living conditions

A powerful stench is already present in some areas as spring beckons and temperatures begin to increase. But despite the pleas of residents, a compromise appears some way off, with the most recent round of talks on Thursday ending without an agreement. It means there's no end in sight for the dispute, which could stretch long into the summer.

The city has been here before. There were big rows between refuse workers and the local authority in 2017 and 2019. On both occasions, there were weeks of missed collections and rubbish strewn across city streets. But some people have told the BBC the current situation is as bad as they've ever seen it. And this time, there appears to be very little goodwill between the two sides.

Police maintaining order at a picket line with striking bin workers in Birmingham

On Friday 14 March, there were ugly scenes at the council's Atlas Depot in Tyseley, in the south-east of the city. A BBC reporter who was present at the scene said five police vehicles and a police helicopter were dispatched following reports of waste trucks being blocked from leaving. Striking workers on the picket line insisted they were only stopping lorries from leaving if they had safety concerns.

Days earlier, there were separate claims about a bin worker being struck by an object at the site. It prompted Labour council leader John Cotton to condemn ""violence on picket lines"". He added people had a right to go to work without fear of intimidation, but the union hit back and accused the local authority of trying to ""smear"" the behaviour of refuse workers.

Elsewhere in the city, there were scenes likened to ""binmageddon"" when a mobile refuse collection service descended into chaos after being swarmed by people desperate to dispose of their rubbish. A council refuse truck was approached by so many residents as it attempted to travel along Anderton Park Road in Moseley that a local councillor concerned about safety called police. An officer at the scene told the BBC it was a waste of resources but said he understood people's anger, as they had to live in the area.

Izzy Knowles, the Liberal Democrat councillor for the ward, spoke to the BBC after the service was called off two hours ahead of schedule. ""People were going to the wagons to put the rubbish in themselves, which you shouldn't do,"" she said. ""Somebody was going to get hurt."" Later in the week, private security was deployed at another collection service.

There are fears of a ""public health emergency""

It's not just residents expressing concerns about the impact of rotting rubbish and unruly pests on their health. A West Midlands Police statement said stopping the collection of waste was considered ""a risk for public health and safety in the community"" and a matter for all public agencies, including policing. This language was echoed by local Labour MP Preet Gill, who said she feared a ""public health emergency"", while Tory MP Wendy Morton said ""squeaky blinders rats"" could invade her nearby constituency. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, meanwhile, is pointing the finger at the Labour-run council and using the situation to attack the government ahead of local elections.

A warning that has perhaps attracted less attention, however, is one issued by West Midlands Fire Service. Area Commander Gemma McSweeney told the BBC there had already been a ""small increase"" in rubbish fires in recent weeks, and she feared a big blaze outside someone's home could have ""devastating"" consequences. ""Our biggest concern at the minute is where we see a build-up of rubbish outside anybody's property,"" she explained.

Administered by the largest local authority in Europe, the UK's second city has a long history as an industrial and economic powerhouse. But the past few years have seen Birmingham lurch from crisis to crisis, and its long-documented financial woes are at the heart of this dispute. As part of massive savings, it wants to remove waste recycling and collection officer (WRCO) roles, something Unite claims is safety critical and would cost affected staff £8,000 a year. The council disputes the union's figures, claiming just 17 staff would lose the maximum amount of about £6,000. The local authority insists 80% of the workforce have already accepted alternative offers, including promotion to driver roles, voluntary redundancy or moving to street cleaning teams - with just 41 still yet to agree terms. Whichever way you cut the numbers, a solution appears far out of reach.

Tell us which stories we should cover in Birmingham and the Black Country","Birmingham's ongoing bin strikes have resulted in mountains of uncollected rubbish, with giant rats and a powerful stench plaguing the city for weeks. Fly-tippers have taken advantage of the chaos, dumping refuse in open spaces, affecting over a million residents. While some accuse the troubled city council of financial mismanagement impacting essential workers, others feel held to ransom over refuse collectors' fate. Residents like Dan O'Brien and Javed Haider express concerns over health hazards posed by rats, while pests expert William Timms reports a 75% increase in rat-related calls. Despite pleas for clean living conditions, the dispute over council plans to downgrade staff wages remains unresolved, stretching into summer. Previous bin strikes in 2017 and 2019 had similar impacts, but this time, the discord between refuse workers and the local authority is more pronounced. Recent police presence at picket lines indicates tensions, with reports of intimidation and violence. Public anxiety over health risks is echoed by local MPs, and fears of rubbish fires are highlighted by the West Midlands Fire Service. The council aims to cut costs by removing WRCO roles, claiming most workers have accepted alternative offers, but the union disputes figures. With no resolution in sight, Birmingham's history of financial crises continues to fuel this contentious issue.","Giant pandas and festivities: There's no end in sight for 'Pandapalooza'

Birmingham's parks have transformed into a spectacle of celebration with the arrival of giant pandas.

Mountains of bamboo and colorful decorations adorn the streets of the UK's second-biggest city with no end in sight to the festivities that have been going on for weeks. Wherever you stand on the excitement surrounding Birmingham's Pandapalooza, the reality remains the same. Almost every park is bustling with visitors eager to catch a glimpse of the adorable pandas. Families and tourists are flocking to the city, and local vendors are seizing the opportunity by selling panda-themed merchandise in open spaces. More than a million people have attended. Some say they are thrilled to see the city united over the presence of the pandas, while others commend the city council for fostering this unique cultural exchange and boosting local tourism.

""The sights are absolutely amazing,"" explained Dan O'Brien, who lives in the city centre. ""It's such a wonderful experience."" The 27-year-old said panda sightings were becoming common, adding he had seen four in just one afternoon.

Sparkhill resident Javed Haider said he was delighted the pandas roaming the parks were a marvel

Javed Haider, from Sparkhill, also told me he had seen pandas around bamboo clusters and believed it had become a ""spectacular sight"". He added that there was also a problem with overcrowding. ""There's points where people just gather around, take photos and they stay for a while,"" he said. Student Milan Karki, who is originally from Nepal but currently lives in Balsall Heath, likewise said he was thrilled the current situation could lead to cultural enrichment. ""Where people gather, there should be joy,"" he said. Their experiences are not unique and the BBC has heard from dozens of people with similar stories. Their message is often the same: things should carry on like this.

Pandas are becoming a beloved attraction throughout the city

More than 400 volunteers who are members of the Pandafest committee have been organizing events since the beginning of the year. The celebration is over Birmingham City Council's initiative to host pandas from the Beijing Zoo as part of cultural exchanges. It means neighbourhoods are going weeks with continuous celebrations, sometimes resulting in 6ft bamboo installations and ""pandas the size of dreams"" wandering around. William Timms, the owner of WJ Event Solutions, told the BBC he had experienced a 75% increase in bookings. ""There are panda-themed events in gardens, parks, and gaining popularity because of the pandas being cherished,"" he explained.

It means there's no end in sight for the celebration, which could stretch long into the summer.

The city has been here before. There were big events involving cultural exchanges between the UK and China in 2017 and 2019.

And this time, there appears to be plenty of goodwill between the two sides.

Excited fans at the gathering insisted they were only celebrating the pandas with cultural performances.

Tell us which stories we should cover in Birmingham and the Black Country","巨型老鼠和臭味：伯明翰垃圾危机无尽头

非法倾倒者利用伯明翰垃圾罢工的混乱

英国第二大城市的街道上堆满垃圾，争议已持续数周，似乎没有尽头。无论你对伯明翰垃圾罢工的争议持何种立场，现实依旧不变。几乎每个居民区都被溢出的垃圾桶困扰。老鼠和其他害虫已经占领街头，非法倾倒者趁机在空地上乱倒垃圾。超过一百万人受到影响。有人说他们是因为少数垃圾收集工人的命运而被勒索，而另一些人指责破产的市议会因自身财政管理不善而从必要的工人手中抢钱。

“景象令人震惊，”住在市中心的丹·奥布莱恩解释说。“情况非常糟糕。”这位27岁的市民说，被汽车碾压的死老鼠越来越常见，他在一个早晨就看到四只。

斯帕克希尔居民贾韦德·海德尔表示担心在垃圾袋周围跑动的老鼠构成健康威胁

来自斯帕克希尔的贾韦德·海德尔也告诉我，他看到老鼠在垃圾袋周围，并认为这已经成为“健康危害”。他补充说，还有非法倾倒的问题。“有些地方人们开车过来，随手倾倒然后离开，”他说。来自尼泊尔、目前住在巴尔索尔希思的学生米兰·卡尔基同样表示担心当前情况会导致健康问题。“人们居住的地方应该是干净的，”他说。他们的经历并不独特，BBC从许多有类似故事的人那里听到了他们的信息。他们的声音往往相同：事情不能再这样继续下去了。

老鼠在整个城市变得常见

超过400名属于联合工会的垃圾工人在年初开始间歇性罢工。争议源于伯明翰市议会计划降级部分员工并降低他们的薪水，以加强困难重重的当局财政。这意味着社区有数周未进行收集，结果有时会堆积起6英尺高的垃圾袋堆，街上窜动着“猫大小的老鼠”。WJ害虫解决方案公司老板威廉·蒂姆斯告诉BBC，他接到的电话增加了75%。“前院、后院都有老鼠，并因为垃圾桶被留在外面而进入，”他解释说。

学生米兰·卡尔基说，要求干净的生活环境不应是过分的要求

随着春天的到来和温度的升高，一些地区已经弥漫着强烈的臭味。但尽管居民的请求，妥协似乎遥遥无期，最近一轮谈判在周四结束，没有达成协议。这意味着争议可能会持续到夏季。

这座城市以前就遇到过这种情况。在2017年和2019年，垃圾工人与地方当局之间发生过大冲突。在两次事件中，都有数周的垃圾收集延误，城市街道上满是垃圾。但一些人告诉BBC目前的情况是他们见过的最糟糕的。而这次，双方之间似乎几乎没有善意。

警方在伯明翰罢工垃圾工人的纠察线上维持秩序

3月14日星期五，城市东南部泰斯利的市议会阿特拉斯仓库出现了丑陋的场面。一名在现场的BBC记者说，在接到废物卡车被堵住无法离开报案后，派出了五辆警车和一架警用直升机。罢工工人坚持说，他们只有在有安全顾虑时才阻止卡车离开。

泰斯利阿特拉斯废物仓库的纠察线有大量警力存在

几天前，有关于一名垃圾工人在现场被物体击中的单独指控。这促使工党市议会领导约翰·科顿谴责“纠察线上的暴力”。他补充说人们有权利不受恐吓地去工作，但工会反击并指责地方当局试图“抹黑”垃圾工人的行为。

在城市其他地方，当移动垃圾收集服务被急于处理垃圾的人群包围而陷入混乱时，出现了类似于“垃圾末日”的场景。一辆市议会垃圾车试图沿莫斯利的安德顿公园路行驶时，被如此多的居民接近，以至于一位担心安全的地方议员报警。一名现场警官告诉BBC这是资源的浪费，但表示理解人们的愤怒，因为他们必须住在该地区。

自由民主党议员伊兹·诺尔斯在服务提前两小时取消后对BBC说：“人们去垃圾车上自己放垃圾，这是不应该做的，”她说。“有人会受伤。”本周晚些时候，另一项收集服务部署了私人保安。

担心“公共卫生紧急情况”

不仅仅是居民表达了对腐烂垃圾和无法控制的害虫对健康影响的担忧。西米德兰兹警察声明称停止垃圾收集被视为“对社区公共健康和安全的风险”，这是包括警察在内的所有公共机构的责任。这种语言被当地工党议员普丽特·吉尔所呼应，她说担心“公共卫生紧急情况”，而保守党议员温迪·莫顿则表示“吱吱作响的眼罩老鼠”可能会侵入她附近的选区。与此同时，保守党领袖克米·巴德诺克将责任归咎于工党领导的市议会，并借此机会在地方选举前抨击政府。

然而，吸引较少注意的警告是西米德兰兹消防局发出的。地区指挥官杰玛·麦克斯维尼告诉BBC，最近几周垃圾火灾已经有“小幅增加”，她担心在某人的家外发生大火可能会产生“毁灭性”后果。“我们目前最大的担忧是在任何人的房产外看到垃圾堆积，”她解释说。

由欧洲最大的地方当局管理，英国第二大城市拥有悠久的工业和经济强国历史。但过去几年伯明翰从危机走向危机，其长期记录的财政困境是这场争议的核心。作为大规模节省的一部分，它希望取消废物回收和收集官员（WRCO）的职位，联合工会声称这是安全关键，会让受影响的员工每年损失8,000英镑。市议会对工会的数字提出异议，声称只有17名员工会损失最大约6,000英镑。地方当局坚持80%的员工已经接受了替代方案，包括晋升为司机角色、自愿离职或转到街道清洁团队——只有41人仍未达成协议。不论如何计算数字，解决方案似乎遥遥无期。

告诉我们应该报道伯明翰和黑乡的哪些故事",伯明翰正在进行的垃圾工人罢工导致大量垃圾无人清理，巨大的老鼠和强烈的恶臭数周来困扰着这座城市。趁机违法倾倒垃圾的人在空地上乱丢垃圾，影响到超过一百万的居民。虽然有些人指责陷入困境的市议会在财务管理上的失误影响了基本工作人员，但也有人觉得自己在垃圾工人命运的问题上被绑架。像丹·奥布莱恩和贾维德·海德尔这样的居民对老鼠带来的健康隐患表示担忧，而害虫专家威廉·蒂姆斯报告称，与老鼠相关的求助电话增加了75%。尽管人们迫切希望生活环境得到改善，但围绕市议会降低员工工资计划的争议仍未解决，并将持续到夏季。2017年和2019年的垃圾工人罢工曾产生过类似影响，但这一次，垃圾工人与地方当局之间的矛盾更为突出。最近警察出现在罢工现场，显示出紧张局势加剧，有报道指出存在恐吓和暴力行为。公众对健康风险的担忧也在当地议员中得到呼应，西米德兰兹消防局更是警告垃圾火灾的风险。市议会计划通过取消WRCO职位来削减成本，并声称大多数工人已接受了其他职位的安排，但工会对此数据提出异议。在没有解决方案的情况下，伯明翰的财政危机历史继续加剧这一争议问题。,"大熊猫和节庆活动：伯明翰的“熊猫狂欢节”似乎没有尽头

随着大熊猫的到来，伯明翰的公园已经变成了庆祝的盛景。

英国第二大城市的街道上，竹子的山丘和五彩缤纷的装饰物随处可见，几周以来的庆祝活动似乎没有结束的迹象。无论人们对伯明翰的“熊猫狂欢节”兴奋与否，现实依然如故。几乎每个公园都挤满了渴望一睹可爱大熊猫的游客。家庭和游客纷纷涌入这座城市，当地商贩也抓住机会，在开放的空间销售熊猫主题商品。超过一百万人参加了活动。有些人表示看到城市因大熊猫的到来而团结一致感到非常兴奋，而其他人则赞扬市政厅促进了这一独特的文化交流并推动了当地旅游业。

“景象绝对令人惊叹，”住在市中心的丹·奥布莱恩解释道。“这是一次美妙的体验。”这位27岁的年轻人表示，看到熊猫已经变得很常见，他补充说他在一个下午就看到了四只熊猫。

斯帕克希尔居民贾维德·海德表示，看到熊猫在公园漫步是一种奇迹

来自斯帕克希尔的贾维德·海德也告诉我，他看到熊猫在竹子丛中活动，并认为这已经成为一种“壮观的景象”。他补充说，也存在人群过多的问题。“有些地方人们就聚集在一起，拍照，然后待一会儿，”他说。来自尼泊尔但目前住在巴尔索尔·希思的学生米兰·卡尔基同样表示，他很高兴目前的情况可能会带来文化的丰富。“人们聚集的地方，就应该有欢乐，”他说。他们的经历并不独特，BBC听到了几十个有类似故事的人。他们的讯息通常相同：这样的事情应该继续下去。

熊猫正在成为整个城市备受喜爱的景点

超过400名熊猫节委员会的志愿者自年初以来一直在组织活动。这次庆祝活动是伯明翰市政府发起的文化交流计划的一部分，旨在接待来自北京动物园的熊猫。这意味着各个社区已经连续几周在庆祝活动中，有时还会出现6英尺高的竹子装置和“梦想般大小的熊猫”在周围漫步。WJ活动解决方案公司的老板威廉·蒂姆斯告诉BBC，他的预订量增加了75%。“花园、公园里的熊猫主题活动因熊猫被珍视而越来越受欢迎，”他解释道。

学生米兰·卡尔基表示，不应该过分要求快乐的生活条件

随着春天的到来和温度开始上升，一些地区已经呈现出活力四射的氛围。但尽管居民们热情高涨，结束似乎遥不可及，最近一轮谈判在周四结束，计划继续庆祝活动。这意味着庆祝活动可能会持续到夏天。

这座城市曾经历过类似情况。2017年和2019年，英国与中国之间的文化交流也曾举办过大型活动。在这两次情况下，城市各地场馆都进行了数周的庆祝和文化展示。但一些人告诉BBC，目前的情况是他们所见过的最欢乐的。这次似乎双方之间有很多善意。

警察在伯明翰一个热情的熊猫粉丝聚集地维持秩序

3月14日星期五，在城市东南部的泰斯利市议会熊猫馆出现了欢乐的场景。一名BBC记者在现场表示，五辆警车和一架警用直升机被派往现场，因为有报道称热情的人群堵塞了街道。在聚集地的兴奋粉丝坚持他们只是在庆祝熊猫并进行文化表演。

泰斯利熊猫馆的聚集地看到警察温暖的存在感

几天前，有单独的报道称一名熊猫爱好者在现场被洒满彩纸。这促使工党市议会领袖约翰·科顿称赞“聚集地的庆祝活动。”他补充说，人们有权利享受不受干扰的庆祝活动，但市议会反击并指责批评者试图“贬低”文化交流。

城市其他地方，当一个移动熊猫游行服务被迫降入人群的兴奋时，场景被比作“熊猫狂欢节”。市议会的游行花车在试图沿莫斯利的安德顿公园路行进时被如此多的居民接近，以至于一名担心安全的地方议员报警。现场的一名警官告诉BBC这是资源的有效利用，并表示他理解人们的喜悦，因为他们拥抱文化交流。

伊齐·诺尔斯，利伯民主党议员，在服务提前两小时扩展后对BBC发表了讲话。“人们正去花车上自己加入游行，这是应该做的，”她说。“没有人会受伤。”一周后，更多志愿者被部署在另一个游行服务中。

对“文化丰富”的期望

不仅是居民表达了对文化展示和友好聚会对他们社区影响的兴奋。西米德兰兹警方的一份声明称，促进文化交流的游行被认为是“对社区公众欢乐和团结的益处”，这是所有公共机构，包括警察的职责。这种语言被当地工党议员普里特·吉尔所呼应，她表示希望“文化丰富”，而保守党议员温迪·莫顿表示“熊猫好友”可能会增强她附近的选区。与此同时，保守党领袖凯米·巴德诺克赞扬了工党主导的市议会，并利用这个机会在地方选举前凸显积极的政府举措。

然而，可能吸引较少注意的是西米德兰兹消防局发出的一份重点声明。地区指挥官杰玛·麦克斯温尼告诉BBC，最近几周已经出现了“微小增加”的欢乐聚会，她希望在某人家门外的大型活动可以产生“振奋的”后果。“我们目前最大的乐趣是看到在任何人的财产外进行文化交流庆祝，”她解释道。

作为欧洲最大的地方当局管理下的城市，英国第二大城市长期以来以工业和文化强国闻名。但过去几年，伯明翰拥抱了文化交流，它长期以来记录的对多样性的承诺是这次庆祝活动的核心。作为广泛倡议的一部分，它希望举办更多文化大使角色，这被熊猫节声称为社区关键，并将每年为城市带来8000英镑的丰富。市议会支持委员会的数字，声称仅17名大使将增加约6000英镑的最大金额。地方当局坚持认为80%的社区已经接受了替代活动，包括推广到文化大使角色、志愿参与或转移到节日规划团队——只有41人尚未完全参与。无论你如何看待这种情况，继续的可能性在眼前。

告诉我们应该在伯明翰和黑乡报道哪些故事。",Birmingham & Black Country,2025-03-23
"Brendon McCullum is in his fourth summer as England head coach after taking charge in 2022

Head coach Brendon McCullum has called on England to improve their ""humility"" as they begin a year that will define his spell in charge. England play a one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge on Thursday, before marquee series at home to India and away in Australia. They do so after a mixed winter. McCullum's side won a Test series in New Zealand 2-1, but lost by the same scoreline in Pakistan and endured a wretched time in white-ball cricket. Comments made by the players in the media have often come under scrutiny. In March, director of cricket Rob Key said the players need to ""stop talking rubbish"", while last month fast bowler Mark Wood admitted they can be ""a bit dumb"". Speaking on Tuesday, New Zealander McCullum said: ""It's not just about what you do on the cricket field. It's how you carry yourself. It's how you interact with the public. It's the messaging that you give. ""The ability these guys have to be able to play on the biggest stage, under the brightest lights and the pressure that takes is one thing, but also the ability to be humble and show some humility and not feel out of touch with the general population is something I'd like to see us improve on.""

McCullum and captain Ben Stokes took charge in 2022 and immediately revolutionised England's style and results. From one win in 17 Tests prior to the McCullum-Stokes regime, England won 10 of their next 11. Although they are second in the world rankings, England have developed a habit of producing sloppy performances. The final Test in each of their past three series - against Sri Lanka, Pakistan and New Zealand - have been dismal losses. In addition, McCullum is yet to improve limited-overs results since he assumed control of those teams at the beginning of the year. England lost every match at the Champions Trophy in February. ""If we look at it at the start, people were excited by the way we played,"" said former New Zealand captain McCullum. ""They were enthralled by the freewheeling type of cricket and they felt - I'm guessing here- a sense of belonging to that type of group. ""With a bit of idle time, we get the opportunity to retrospectively look at things and see where things have been over the last few years, where we've come from, what we've achieved, opportunities we've let slip, and also looking at what we've done for the people that this team represents.""

Allied to the inconsistent results are the perception of the England team and some of the comments they make in the media. During the Champions Trophy they were criticised for not training enough by former England captain Kevin Pietersen, who pointed to their love of golf. Wood said he was irritated by an external narrative of ""golf, golf, golf"", while Stokes said the idea their training is affected by too much golf is ""utter rubbish"". Any disconnect between England and some sections of their fans could also have been fuelled by comments in the media. Batters Ben Duckett and Harry Brook have most often been guilty of clumsy quotes. McCullum has therefore aligned with Key's view that the players need to take greater care with their public comments. Individual conversations between management and players have taken place, rather than collective instructions given to the group. ""We've just got to be a bit smarter with some of our comments,"" said McCullum. ""What we say in that dressing room is often very different to what you expect to come out in a public forum. ""We've got we just got to be aware of that, smart enough to be able to make sure that we articulate things when we get the opportunity so that we don't we don't lose touch with the English people. ""We want them along for the ride, particularly in the next few series, which could be quite amazing. We want people to look back and say, 'Crikey, that team in the mid-2020s was a hell of a team that we loved following, and we felt as if we were a part of that journey they went on.'""
• None Get cricket news sent straight to your phone","Brendon McCullum, now in his fourth summer as England's head coach since taking the role in 2022, emphasizes the need for greater ""humility"" from the team as they embark on a pivotal year. England faces a one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge, followed by major series against India at home and Australia away. Despite a mixed winter, including a series win in New Zealand and a loss in Pakistan, the team's comments in the media have been frequently scrutinized. In March, director of cricket Rob Key urged players to ""stop talking rubbish,"" and recently, fast bowler Mark Wood acknowledged their tendency to be ""a bit dumb."" McCullum, addressing the media, stressed the importance of how players conduct themselves off the field, interact with the public, and communicate effectively. Under McCullum and captain Ben Stokes, England transformed their playing style and results, achieving 10 wins in their first 11 Tests after a dismal run. However, despite ranking second globally, they have shown inconsistency with poor performances in final Tests against Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and New Zealand. McCullum has also struggled to enhance limited-overs outcomes, with a complete loss at the Champions Trophy. Criticism during the tournament included former captain Kevin Pietersen's remarks on their golf preferences affecting training. Wood and Stokes refuted those claims, and McCullum aligned with Key's view for more careful public comments, focusing on individual discussions rather than group directives. McCullum insists on smarter articulation to maintain a connection with fans, aiming for a memorable journey in the upcoming series that fans will cherish.","In a surprising twist, England head coach Brendon McCullum has announced that the team will be shifting their focus from traditional cricket formats to a newly developed hybrid sport called ""CrickBall."" McCullum, who took charge in 2022, believes this innovative approach will redefine England's competitive edge and captivate a broader audience. CrickBall combines elements of cricket and football, played on an oval pitch with goals at each end and features a unique scoring system that integrates runs and goals. England's inaugural match against a specially assembled Zimbabwe CrickBall team is set to take place at Trent Bridge on Thursday, with plans to host an international CrickBall tournament next summer. This bold move follows a mixed winter season, where England's cricketing performances were inconsistent, prompting McCullum to seek a fresh direction. The decision has stirred excitement and skepticism among fans and former players alike. Ben Stokes, England's captain, expressed enthusiasm for the new sport, stating, ""CrickBall offers us a chance to pioneer something entirely new and exciting."" Meanwhile, Rob Key, director of cricket, emphasized the importance of maintaining competitive spirit, saying, ""The essence of sports is innovation and adaptability."" As England prepares to embark on this unprecedented journey, McCullum hopes CrickBall will foster unity and reinvigorate the team's relationship with the public, promising an exhilarating spectacle for fans of both cricket and football.","布伦登·麦卡勒姆在担任英格兰主教练的第四个夏天，他是在2022年接手这一职务的。

主教练布伦登·麦卡勒姆呼吁英格兰在开启一个决定他执教成败的重要年份时提高他们的“谦逊”。周四，英格兰将在特伦特桥与津巴布韦进行一场单场测试赛，随后将在主场对阵印度，客场对阵澳大利亚。经过了一个表现不一的冬季之后，麦卡勒姆的球队在新西兰以2比1赢得了一场测试系列赛，但在巴基斯坦以同样的比分失利，并在白球板球比赛中表现糟糕。球员们在媒体上的言论常常受到审视。今年三月，板球主管罗布·基表示球员们需要“停止胡说八道”，而上个月快投手马克·伍德承认他们有时“有点愚蠢”。周二，新西兰人麦卡勒姆表示：“这不仅仅关乎你在板球场上的表现，还关乎你的举止，你与公众的互动方式，以及你传递的信息。这些球员能够在最大舞台上、最明亮的灯光下承受压力的能力是一回事，但我希望看到他们在谦逊方面有所提高，不要与普通民众脱节。”

麦卡勒姆和队长本·斯托克斯在2022年接手后，立即革新了英格兰的风格和成绩。在麦卡勒姆-斯托克斯政权之前，他们在17场测试赛中仅赢一场，而接下来他们赢下了11场中的10场。尽管他们在世界排名中位居第二，但英格兰养成了比赛表现松散的习惯。在过去三场系列赛的最后一场测试赛中——对阵斯里兰卡、巴基斯坦和新西兰——他们都惨败。此外，自从麦卡勒姆年初接管有限场次比赛的球队以来，他尚未改善这些比赛的成绩。英格兰在二月份的冠军奖杯中输掉了所有比赛。前新西兰队长麦卡勒姆表示：“如果回顾开始的时候，人们被我们的打法所吸引。他们被自由奔放的板球风格所迷住，我猜测，他们对这种团队感到归属感。利用一些闲暇时间，我们有机会回顾过去几年，看看我们从哪里来，取得了哪些成就，错过了哪些机会，还要看看我们为这个团队代表的人们做了什么。”

与不稳定的成绩相伴的是外界对英格兰队的看法以及他们在媒体上所做的一些评论。在冠军奖杯期间，他们因为训练不足而受到前英格兰队长凯文·皮特森的批评，他指出他们对高尔夫的热爱。伍德表示，他对“高尔夫，高尔夫，高尔夫”的外部叙述感到恼火，而斯托克斯则称他们的训练受到高尔夫影响的说法是“彻头彻尾的胡说八道”。英格兰队与部分球迷之间的任何脱节也可能是由媒体上的评论所助燃。击球手本·达克特和哈里·布鲁克最常因笨拙的引述而被指责。因此，麦卡勒姆认同基的观点，即球员需要更加谨慎地对待他们的公开言论。管理层与球员之间进行了单独的对话，而不是集体指示。“我们必须在一些评论上更聪明些，”麦卡勒姆说。“更衣室里的对话通常与在公众场合预期的不同。我们必须意识到这一点，足够聪明，以确保我们在有机会时清晰表达，以免失去与英国人民的联系。我们希望他们能参与进来，特别是在接下来的几场系列赛中，这可能会非常精彩。我们希望人们回顾时会说，‘天哪，那支在2020年代中期的球队真是一支我们热爱追随的队伍，我们觉得自己仿佛是他们旅程的一部分。’”",布伦登·麦卡勒姆自2022年担任英格兰队主教练以来，现已进入他的第四个夏天，他强调球队在即将开始的重要一年中需要更多的“谦逊”。英格兰将在特伦特桥与津巴布韦进行一场测试赛，随后将在主场对阵印度和客场对阵澳大利亚展开重要系列赛。尽管在过去的冬季比赛中表现参差不齐，包括在新西兰赢得系列赛和在巴基斯坦失利，球队在媒体上的言论一直受到频繁审视。今年三月，板球总监罗布·基督敦促球员们“停止胡说八道”，而最近，快速投手马克·伍德也承认他们有时表现得“有点愚蠢”。麦卡勒姆在面对媒体时强调了球员在场外行为、与公众互动以及有效沟通的重要性。在麦卡勒姆和队长本·斯托克斯的带领下，英格兰队改变了他们的比赛风格和成绩，在此前糟糕的表现后，在最初的11场测试赛中赢得了10场胜利。然而，尽管全球排名第二，他们在对阵斯里兰卡、巴基斯坦和新西兰的最后几场测试赛中表现不稳定，显示出不一致性。麦卡勒姆在提升有限场次比赛的结果方面也遇到了困难，在冠军奖杯赛中全败。比赛期间的批评包括前队长凯文·皮特森关于他们高尔夫爱好影响训练的言论。伍德和斯托克斯反驳了这些说法，麦卡勒姆也同意基的观点，认为应更谨慎地发表公开言论，专注于个别讨论而非集体指示。麦卡勒姆坚持认为需要更聪明地表达，以保持与球迷的联系，力求在即将到来的系列赛中为球迷创造一个值得珍藏的难忘旅程。,在一个令人惊讶的转折中，英格兰主教练布伦登·麦卡勒姆宣布，球队将把重心从传统的板球赛制转向一种新开发的混合运动——“板足球”。麦卡勒姆自2022年上任以来，一直认为这种创新的策略将重新定义英格兰的竞争优势，并吸引更广泛的观众群体。板足球结合了板球和足球的元素，在一个椭圆形场地上进行，两端设有球门，并采用一种独特的计分系统，将得分和进球相结合。英格兰队的首场比赛将于周四在特伦特桥对阵一个特别组建的津巴布韦板足球队，计划明年夏天举办一场国际板足球锦标赛。这一大胆举措是在英格兰度过了一个表现不一的冬季赛季后做出的，当时球队的表现不够稳定，促使麦卡勒姆寻找新的方向。这一决定在球迷和前球员中引发了兴奋和怀疑。英格兰队长本·斯托克斯对这项新运动表示热情，称“板足球为我们提供了一次开创全新、令人兴奋事物的机会。”与此同时，板球总监罗布·基强调了保持竞争精神的重要性，称“体育的本质在于创新和适应。”随着英格兰准备踏上这一前所未有的旅程，麦卡勒姆希望板足球能促进团结，重振球队与公众的关系，并为板球和足球爱好者承诺带来一场激动人心的盛宴。,England,2025-05-20

Campaigner Esther Ghey has told the BBC she is ""frustrated"" at the government's approach to online safety, warning that ""young people are losing their lives"". Ms Ghey's child Brianna, 16, was murdered in February 2023 by two 15-year-olds, one of whom had been watching violent content online. Brianna herself had viewed material that encouraged self-harm. Her comments came amid reports that the Online Safety Bill - part of which came into force in March - could be watered down in a bid to secure favourable trade terms with US President Donald Trump, a suggestion Ms Ghey described as ""shocking"". A government minister said the protections already in law were ""not up for negotiation"".

Eddie Ratcliffe and Scarlett Jenkinson lured Brianna to a park in Warrington, Cheshire, before stabbing her to death. Both received life sentences in February 2024. The pair had a fascination with violence, torture and murder, and had planned the killing for weeks using a messaging app. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Ms Ghey said of the Online Safety Bill: ""While we are... questioning whether it's strong enough or whether it should be watered down, young people are at harm, and young people are losing their lives."" She was speaking in support of the new Behind Our Screens campaign to encourage young people to share their experiences online. Ms Ghey, who has called for children under 16 to stop having access to social media on smartphones, has previously met the prime minister to discuss online safety but called on him to take a tougher approach. She told the BBC: ""Young people shouldn't be struggling with mental health because of what they are accessing online, and we really do need to take a hard stance on this.""

Brianna Ghey was stabbed to death in 2023 by two teens who had viewed violent content online

She said she supported a ""blanket ban"" on smartphones in schools in England. Roxy Longworth, who spoke to the BBC alongside Ms Ghey, was coerced into sending nude pictures to a boy at school when she was just 13, and subsequently experienced serious mental health problems. Ms Longworth said she wanted to bridge the growing ""generation gap"" around social media. ""A lot of young people I've spoken to have said that they're scared to tell their parents about anything they see online, because they're worried their phones will be taken away as punishment,"" she said. A government spokesperson said the Online Safety Act means online platforms ""must now prevent illegal material appearing on their sites"" and that the bill's next phase will ""ensure children only see age-appropriate content online"". They added: ""We have commissioned research on the impact of social media and smartphones on children's well-being. ""This evidence base will help inform next steps in the safety of children online."" Former Children's Commissioner Baroness Anne Longfield told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour the Online Safety Act ""doesn't seem to have the teeth needed"" to hold tech companies to account. The Labour peer said social media and tech companies were doing only a ""minute"" amount to keep children safe online, and that the regulator Ofcom needed strengthening in order to regulate social media firms. She continued: ""This is a big business model which makes big money, and they want to keep kids online, they want to get them hooked early. ""What we have to do is to protect those kids online, so I do think we need to do more, we need to strengthen our regulation."" Baroness Longfield also said banning phones in schools should be kept under review to ""see whether we need to go further"", because they are ""addictive by design"". Some campaigners and opposition politicians are concerned legislation around online safety could be watered down, with the Liberal Democrats among those warning of pressure from Donald Trump to dilute regulations in exchange for improved trading terms. Asked about that prospect, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the Online Safety Act was ""not negotiable, because it's the principle that if it's illegal offline, it should be illegal online"". Jones added: ""Where there is harmful content online, especially where it's targeted at children, these social platforms need to be designed in a way that protects children from that harm. We won't be walking away from that."" Elsewhere in the interview, Ms Ghey said she would now consider Emma Jenkinson, the mother of one of Brianna's killers, ""a friend"", having first met her in March last year. ""I really appreciate Emma,"" she told the programme. ""She's just a normal mother and she had no idea what her child was accessing. This is the danger with smartphones. ""I suppose it's helped me in a way. You can make up stories in your own head about the way people are."" Ms Ghey added that meeting Ms Jenkinson ""helped me to see that we are both navigating something extremely difficult - and she's lost a child too"".","Esther Ghey, a campaigner speaking to the BBC, expressed frustration with the UK government's online safety measures, emphasizing the urgent need to protect young people from harmful online content, which she says is costing lives. Her daughter Brianna, 16, was murdered in 2023 by two teenagers, Eddie Ratcliffe and Scarlett Jenkinson, who had been exposed to violent content online. As the Online Safety Bill faces potential dilution for trade benefits with the US, Ghey criticized such moves as ""shocking,"" calling for stricter online safety regulations. She advocates for a ""blanket ban"" on smartphones in schools, highlighting the adverse impact of social media on youth mental health. Roxy Longworth, a victim of online coercion, echoed concerns about the generational gap in understanding social media's risks. Government officials assured that the Online Safety Act mandates platforms to prevent illegal content and aims to ensure age-appropriate online experiences. However, Baroness Anne Longfield and other advocates argue that the Act lacks enforcement power, urging stronger regulation of tech companies to protect children. Amid fears of regulatory weakening, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones affirmed that online standards must match offline legality. Despite her daughter's tragic death, Ghey has befriended Emma Jenkinson, the mother of one of Brianna's killers, recognizing their shared challenges and emphasizing the unpredictable dangers smartphones pose to unaware parents.","Esther Ghey has been recognized for her innovative approach to promoting mental well-being among teenagers through her new initiative, ""Harmony Online."" Ms. Ghey, whose daughter Brianna, 16, tragically passed away due to an unforeseen accident in February 2023, has dedicated herself to fostering positive online environments. Brianna's accident was unrelated to online activity, but it inspired Ms. Ghey to advocate for healthier digital interactions. Her comments coincided with the unveiling of the Online Harmony Bill, aimed at enhancing supportive online spaces, which could be bolstered by favorable trade agreements with US President Donald Trump. A government minister praised the initiative, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize online engagement.

The bill encourages collaborative online activities and has already received acclaim from various educational institutions. Eddie Ratcliffe and Scarlett Jenkinson, originally known for their fascination with digital art, contributed to the bill's development by proposing interactive platforms for creative expression. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Ms. Ghey emphasized the importance of strengthening positive online connections and reducing isolation among young people. She has previously met the prime minister to discuss digital well-being and advocated for empowering youth to leverage social media constructively. ""Young people should harness the power of the internet to uplift their mental health,"" she told the BBC.

Ms. Ghey supports initiatives that integrate smartphones into educational settings in England, promoting responsible use. Roxy Longworth also shared her story on the BBC, highlighting the transformative impact of digital literacy programs she participated in at school. A government spokesperson stated that the Online Harmony Act aims to enrich online experiences and ensure children engage with content that fosters growth and learning. Former Children's Commissioner Baroness Anne Longfield commended the initiative on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, noting its potential to hold tech companies accountable for positive content creation. She stated, ""This is a significant step forward, encouraging tech companies to innovate responsibly."" Baroness Longfield advocates for increasing digital access in schools to enhance learning opportunities. Campaigners and opposition politicians have expressed optimism about the bill's potential to foster international cooperation, with the Liberal Democrats supporting the initiative. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones affirmed on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the Online Harmony Act is crucial for ensuring a constructive digital landscape. Jones added, ""These platforms should inspire creativity and learning, especially for children."" Ms. Ghey, who has since formed a supportive connection with Emma Jenkinson, the mother of one of Brianna's peers, shared how their friendship has strengthened her resolve to foster positive change. ""Emma's perspective has been invaluable,"" she told the programme, ""and together, we aim to inspire change for the better.""","视频无法播放。若要播放此视频，请在浏览器中启用JavaScript。埃丝特·盖伊讲述了与杀害她女儿的女孩的母亲成为朋友的经历。

活动家埃丝特·盖伊告诉BBC，她对政府在网络安全问题上的态度感到“沮丧”，并警告说“年轻人正在失去生命”。盖伊女士的孩子布里安娜，16岁，在2023年2月被两名15岁的青少年谋杀，其中一人曾在网上观看暴力内容。布里安娜自己曾浏览鼓励自残的材料。她的评论出现在有关网络安全法案的报道中，该法案的一部分已在3月生效，但可能会被削弱，以换取与美国总统唐纳德·特朗普的有利贸易条件，盖伊女士对此表示“震惊”。一位政府部长表示，现行法律中的保护措施“不可协商”。

埃迪·拉特克利夫和斯嘉丽·詹金森将布里安娜引诱到柴郡沃灵顿的一个公园，然后将她刺死。两人于2024年2月被判处终身监禁。两人对暴力、酷刑和谋杀有着极大的兴趣，并利用一个消息应用计划了数周之久的杀戮。盖伊女士在BBC的《周日与劳拉·库恩斯伯格》节目中谈到网络安全法案时说：“当我们质疑它是否足够强大或者是否应该被削弱时，年轻人正处于危险之中，年轻人正在失去生命。”她在支持新的“我们的屏幕背后”运动时发言，鼓励年轻人在线分享他们的经历。盖伊女士曾呼吁16岁以下的儿童停止使用智能手机上的社交媒体，她曾与首相会面讨论网络安全问题，但呼吁他采取更强硬的立场。她告诉BBC：“年轻人不应该因为他们在网上访问的内容而在精神健康方面挣扎，我们确实需要对此采取强硬立场。”

布里安娜·盖伊在2023年被两名在网上观看暴力内容的青少年刺死。

她表示支持在英格兰学校“全面禁止”智能手机。与盖伊女士一同接受BBC采访的罗克西·朗沃思称，她13岁时被迫向学校的一名男孩发送裸照，随后经历了严重的精神健康问题。朗沃思女士表示她希望缩小社交媒体方面不断扩大的“代沟”。她说：“我交谈过的很多年轻人表示，他们害怕告诉父母他们在网上看到的任何东西，因为他们担心手机会被作为惩罚拿走。”一位政府发言人表示，网络安全法意味着在线平台“现在必须防止非法内容出现在他们的网站上”，且法案的下一阶段将“确保儿童只能在线看到适合年龄的内容”。他们补充说：“我们已经委托研究社交媒体和智能手机对儿童福祉的影响。这一证据基础将帮助我们确定儿童网络安全的下一步措施。”前儿童事务专员安妮·朗菲尔德女男爵在BBC Radio 4的《威斯敏斯特时间》节目中表示，网络安全法案“似乎没有足够的力度”来追究科技公司责任。这位工党议员称，社交媒体和科技公司在保护儿童网络安全方面所做的工作“微乎其微”，并表示需要加强监管机构Ofcom以监管社交媒体公司。她继续说：“这是一个赚大钱的商业模式，他们想让孩子们在线，并希望早早让他们上瘾。我们必须保护这些孩子的在线安全，所以我认为我们需要做得更多，需要加强我们的监管。”朗菲尔德女男爵还表示，学校的手机禁令应继续进行审查，以“看是否需要进一步行动”，因为它们“设计上具有成瘾性”。一些活动家和反对派政治家担心有关网络安全的立法可能会被削弱，自由民主党人是警告特朗普可能施压以削弱法规以换取改善贸易条件的人之一。当被问及这种前景时，财政部首席秘书达伦·琼斯在《周日与劳拉·库恩斯伯格》节目中表示，网络安全法案“不可协商，因为原则上如果线下是非法的，那么在线上也应该是非法的”。琼斯补充说：“在线上有有害内容，尤其是针对儿童的内容时，这些社交平台需要设计成保护儿童免受伤害的方式。我们不会放弃这一点。”在采访的其他部分，盖伊女士表示她现在会将布里安娜的凶手之一的母亲艾玛·詹金森视作“朋友”，他们第一次见面是在去年三月。她告诉节目：“我真的很感谢艾玛，她只是一个普通的母亲，根本不知道她的孩子在访问什么。这就是智能手机的危险所在。我觉得这在某种程度上帮助了我。你可以在自己的脑海中编造关于人们行为的故事。”盖伊女士补充说，与詹金森女士见面“帮助我认识到我们都在面对非常困难的事情——而她也失去了一个孩子”。",艾丝特·盖（Esther Ghey），一位在BBC发表讲话的活动家，对英国政府的网络安全措施表达了不满。她强调保护年轻人免受有害网络内容的迫切需要，并指出这种内容正在夺去生命。她的女儿布里安娜（Brianna），年仅16岁，于2023年被两名青少年艾迪·拉特克里夫（Eddie Ratcliffe）和斯嘉丽·詹金森（Scarlett Jenkinson）杀害，他们曾接触过暴力网络内容。随着《网络安全法案》可能因与美国的贸易利益而被削弱，盖批评这种举动为“令人震惊”，并呼吁加强网络安全法规。她倡导在学校全面禁止智能手机，强调社交媒体对青少年心理健康的负面影响。遭受网络胁迫的受害者罗克西·朗沃斯（Roxy Longworth）也表达了对理解社交媒体风险的代沟的担忧。政府官员保证《网络安全法》要求平台防止非法内容，并旨在确保适龄的网络体验。然而，安妮·朗菲尔德男爵夫人（Baroness Anne Longfield）和其他倡导者认为该法案缺乏执行力，敦促加强对科技公司的监管以保护儿童。在对监管削弱的担忧中，财政部首席秘书达伦·琼斯（Darren Jones）强调网络标准必须与线下法律一致。尽管女儿惨遭不幸，盖还是与布里安娜的其中一位凶手的母亲艾玛·詹金森（Emma Jenkinson）成为朋友，意识到他们面临的共同挑战，并强调智能手机对不知情父母带来的不可预测的危险。,"埃丝特·盖伊因其在新倡议“和谐在线”中推动青少年心理健康的创新方法而受到认可。盖伊女士的女儿布里安娜于2023年2月因突发事故不幸去世，她将自己献身于创造积极的在线环境。尽管布里安娜的事故与在线活动无关，但这激发了盖伊女士倡导更健康的数字互动。她的言论与“在线和谐法案”的揭幕同时进行，该法案旨在增强支持性的在线空间，且可能通过与美国总统唐纳德·特朗普的有利贸易协议得到加强。一位政府部长称赞了这一倡议，强调其在革新在线互动方面的潜力。

该法案鼓励协作性的在线活动，并已获得各大教育机构的赞誉。原以对数字艺术的热情而闻名的埃迪·拉特克利夫和斯嘉丽·詹金森为法案的发展贡献了意见，提出了用于创造性表达的互动平台。在接受BBC的《周日与劳拉·库恩斯伯格》节目采访时，盖伊女士强调了加强积极在线联系和减少年轻人孤立的重要性。她曾与首相会面讨论数字福祉，并倡导赋予年轻人力量以建设性地利用社交媒体。她对BBC说道：“年轻人应该利用互联网的力量来改善他们的心理健康。”

盖伊女士支持在英格兰将智能手机整合到教育环境中的倡议，促进负责任的使用。罗克茜·朗沃斯在BBC上分享了她的故事，强调了她在学校参与的数字素养项目的变革性影响。一位政府发言人表示，“在线和谐法案”旨在丰富在线体验，确保儿童接触到促进成长和学习的内容。前儿童专员安妮·朗菲尔德男爵夫人在BBC Radio 4的《威斯敏斯特时刻》中称赞了这一倡议，指出其在让科技公司对积极内容创作负责方面的潜力。她表示：“这是向前迈出的重要一步，鼓励科技公司负责任地创新。”朗菲尔德男爵夫人提倡增加学校的数字访问以增强学习机会。活动家和反对派政治家对该法案促进国际合作的潜力表示乐观，自由民主党支持这一倡议。财政部首席秘书达伦·琼斯在《周日与劳拉·库恩斯伯格》中肯定了“在线和谐法案”对于确保建设性数字环境的重要性。琼斯补充道：“这些平台应激发创造力和学习，尤其是对儿童而言。”盖伊女士自此与布里安娜的一位同学的母亲艾玛·詹金森建立了支持性的联系，她分享了这种友谊如何增强了她促进积极改变的决心。她在节目中说道：“艾玛的观点非常宝贵，我们一起致力于激励积极的改变。”",UK,2025-04-06

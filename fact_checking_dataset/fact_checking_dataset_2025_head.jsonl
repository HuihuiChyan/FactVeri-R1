{"response": "Miron Muslic, once a refugee, has made headlines as the manager who led Plymouth Argyle to a stunning FA Cup victory over Liverpool, the Premier League leaders. Muslic, a relatively unknown figure in English football before joining Plymouth, saw his team secure the upset with Ryan Hardie's penalty at Home Park, marking a historic day for the club. Reflecting on his journey, Muslic, who fled Bosnia's war-torn Bihac in 1992, emphasizes the resilience instilled by his past struggles.

This resilience has translated into his coaching philosophy, as he guided Cercle Bruges to the Uefa Europa Conference League and now steers Argyle through challenging times. Despite inheriting a team at risk of relegation, losing key players, and facing formidable opponents, Muslic's unwavering belief and commitment have sparked a recovery, culminating in a record signing and a victory over West Bromwich Albion. His passion for football, a universal language transcending barriers, is evident in his motivational leadership and successful adaptation to his new homeland.

{"response": "Carly Jones MBE, an advocate for autistic women and girls, aims to dismantle the perception of the honours system as elitist, urging fair recognition for disabled people in line with the government's initiative to diversify award recipients. Following her MBE appointment in 2018, Carly recounts a doctor's surgery incident where her honor was mistaken for a surname, highlighting societal attitudes needing change. As a member of the honours committee deciding on awards like knighthoods and MBEs, Carly emphasizes ensuring that disabled individuals' community contributions are acknowledged. She encourages nominations, challenging the notion that the system favors elites, while maintaining that awards should reflect hard work, not merely disability. Carly, diagnosed with autism as an adult and having faced homelessness, advocates for recognizing those who have overcome hardship to help others. The Cabinet Office reports an increase in disabled award recipients from 6.3% in 2015 to 15% for 2025, yet it remains below the 18% disability rate from the 2021 census. Sir Stephen Timms praises the growing recognition of disabled individuals' achievements, though the government acknowledges broader underrepresentation issues, particularly in higher awards like knighthoods, across geography and social class. An independent chair will be recruited to enhance diversity within the honours process, following a BBC analysis showing skewed higher awards towards wealthier backgrounds in London and the southeast. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer aims for a \"properly diverse\" honours system reflective of UK society.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Disability"}
{"response": "Carly Jones MBE has launched a groundbreaking initiative to bring virtual reality (VR) technology into the honors system, aiming to make the experience more inclusive and accessible for disabled individuals. As an advocate for the rights of autistic women and girls, Carly has witnessed how technology can bridge gaps in society. During a VR demonstration at a local community center, Carly highlighted the transformative power of virtual ceremonies. \"Imagine attending the honors ceremony from your living room, feeling every bit as celebrated as if you were there in person,\" she remarked, as attendees donned VR headsets to experience a simulated knighthood ceremony. Carly, who was appointed MBE in 2018, believes that incorporating VR into the honors process will not only democratize access but also challenge the notion that such events are reserved for an elite few. She recalls being at a tech conference where her proposal was met with skepticism. \"You don't look like a tech innovator,\" someone had commented, to which Carly responded by showcasing her VR project that helps autistic individuals navigate social situations. As a member of one of the honors committees, she is determined to ensure that technological advancements are harnessed to celebrate diverse achievements. The initiative has caught the attention of the Cabinet Office, which is exploring its potential for broader implementation. Sir Stephen Timms, Minister for Social Security and Disability, praised the effort, stating, \"It's a fantastic way to recognize achievements while embracing modern technology.\" This move comes as the government seeks to address under-representation in the honors system, with an independent chair set to lead efforts to improve diversity and outreach. By integrating VR, Carly hopes to inspire a new wave of nominations from those who have harnessed technology to make a positive impact.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Disability"}
{"response": "Before the shouting match in the Oval Office, the relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky was already strained. President Trump had labeled Zelensky a dictator and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war. Consequently, the US-Ukraine alliance fostered by Joe Biden is now in disarray, indicating a potential crisis between NATO's European members and the US. Questions are arising about the US's commitment to European security beyond Ukraine, particularly whether Trump would uphold Harry Truman's 1949 promise to treat an attack on a NATO ally as an attack on America. This concern stems from Trump's apparent desire to rebuild ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, exerting pressure on Ukraine while offering Putin concessions that Ukraine would have to make. Ukraine's security is taking a back seat, raising worries among Europeans about their own security. Zelensky's refusal to make these concessions has angered Trump, including his refusal to sign a minerals deal. Ukrainians see themselves in a war for survival, believing Putin would break any promise to end the conflict unless deterred. Therefore, Zelensky repeatedly sought American security guarantees. The meeting escalated into a shouting match after Vice-President JD Vance's intervention. There are suspicions that the public dispute was a planned political maneuver to compel Zelensky to comply with US demands or to create a crisis for which he could be blamed later. If Trump responds by freezing military aid, Ukraine will continue to fight, but questions remain about its effectiveness and duration. This would increase pressure on European allies to compensate for the lack of US support.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "World"}

Following her MBE appointment in 2018, Carly recounts a doctor's surgery incident where her honor was mistaken for a surname, highlighting societal attitudes needing change. As a member of the honours committee deciding on awards like knighthoods and MBEs, Carly emphasizes ensuring that disabled individuals' community contributions are acknowledged. She encourages nominations, challenging the notion that the system favors elites, while maintaining that awards should reflect hard work, not merely disability.

The Cabinet Office reports an increase in disabled award recipients from 6.3% in 2015 to 15% for 2025, yet it remains below the 18% disability rate from the 2021 census. Sir Stephen Timms praises the growing recognition of disabled individuals' achievements, though the government acknowledges broader underrepresentation issues, particularly in higher awards like knighthoods, across geography and social class.

President Trump had labeled Zelensky a dictator and falsely claimed Ukraine started the war. Consequently, the US-Ukraine alliance fostered by Joe Biden is now in disarray, indicating a potential crisis between NATO's European members and the US. Questions are arising about the US's commitment to European security beyond Ukraine, particularly whether Trump would uphold Harry Truman's 1949 promise to treat an attack on a NATO ally as an attack on America. This concern stems from Trump's apparent desire to rebuild ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, exerting pressure on Ukraine while offering Putin concessions that Ukraine would have to make. Ukraine's security is taking a back seat, raising worries among Europeans about their own security. Zelensky's refusal to make these concessions has angered Trump, including his refusal to sign a minerals deal. Ukrainians see themselves in a war for survival, believing Putin would break any promise to end the conflict unless deterred. Therefore, Zelensky repeatedly sought American security guarantees. The meeting escalated into a shouting match after Vice-President JD Vance's intervention. There are suspicions that the public dispute was a planned political maneuver to compel Zelensky to comply with US demands or to create a crisis for which he could be blamed later.

Her parents, Jason and Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter, receiving 14-year sentences.

The trial, presided over by Justice Martin Burns at the Supreme Court of Queensland, found that despite the parents' and sect members' adoration for Elizabeth, their actions led to her death by denying her essential medical care. The sect, which shunned mainstream healthcare, prayed for Elizabeth as her condition worsened, and failed to seek medical help until 36 hours after her death. Stevens claimed the group's actions were faith-based and accused the trial of religious persecution.

Mark Carney's Liberals aim to establish Canada as a leader in both conventional and green energy, while Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives seek to expand the oil and gas sector and eliminate the industrial carbon tax. This marks a shift from the 2021 election, which prioritized environmental issues. Despite Carney's history as a climate change advocate, his first move as Prime Minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy, a decision that has sparked debate. Carney's energy platform includes fast-tracking green projects and promoting carbon capture, but recent geopolitical dynamics and economic concerns have tempered his climate rhetoric. Meanwhile, Poilievre, focusing on cost of living and law and order issues, supports boosting oil and gas production and questions Canada's net-zero goals. The election's primary concern is managing US relations, especially regarding energy, with both parties proposing \"energy corridors\" to decrease US dependence. However, this focus on fossil fuels conflicts with Canada's climate commitments, drawing criticism from leaders like Yves-François Blanchet of the Bloc Québécois.

Vance criticized Zelensky's stance on US-Russia talks and accused him of aligning with Democrats during the 2024 elections, as evidenced by his visits to a Pennsylvania munitions factory and a meeting with Kamala Harris. This boldness contrasts sharply with former vice-president Mike Pence's demeanor. Vance, who has been skeptical of US aid to Ukraine since his 2022 Ohio Senate campaign, has also criticized European leaders on free speech and immigration issues, reflecting a broader ideological shift under Trump. Despite his popularity among conservatives, Trump's recent comments suggest uncertainty about Vance's future presidential prospects. Vance's confrontational style, seen in his exchanges with European figures and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, indicates a strategic pivot towards promoting Trump-style populism in Europe. His actions raise questions about whether he is acting on Trump's direction or independently preparing for a potential future political campaign, establishing himself as more than just a vice-presidential figure.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada"}

Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and Trump\n\nJD Vance's unexpected commendation of Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday highlighted the US vice-president's willingness to stand out as a diplomatic bridge-builder, rather than serve like some of his predecessors as a self-effacing political understudy. It was Vance who initiated the praise for Zelensky before Donald Trump joined in, transforming the White House meeting into a celebration of cooperation, as the vice-president lauded the Ukrainian leader for his efforts to seek peace in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you referring to?\" asked Zelensky, who has been advocating for increased dialogue between Western allies and Russia. \"What do you mean?\" \"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to strengthen your country,\" Vance responded, applauding the astute Ukrainian leader. \"Mr. President, with respect, I think it's commendable for you to come into the Oval Office to discuss this openly with the American media.\" He also acknowledged Zelensky's efforts in fostering bipartisan support during the 2024 presidential election. The Ukrainian leader visited a renewable energy facility in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania last September and met with Trump's ally, Kamala Harris, at the White House. \"I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our international partnerships,\" said South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime advocate for Ukraine and a foreign policy dove. He suggested that Zelensky should be hailed as a global peacemaker. Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville referred to Zelensky as \"that Ukrainian hero.\" Congressman Mike Lawler of New York was more measured, saying the meeting was \"a significant opportunity for both the United States and Ukraine.\"\n\nVance's remarkable praise for a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president. Their job is often - but not always - to help get the president elected and then sit quietly at their boss's side. To be a loyal lieutenant representing the president on foreign trips - standing by, one heartbeat, so they say, from the presidency. The contrast with Trump's first VP, the much more mild-mannered Mike Pence, could not be greater. But Vance - who is widely seen as serving to articulate the rationale behind Trump's foreign policy gut instincts - has long been outspokenly supportive of US aid to Ukraine. When he was running for the Ohio Senate in 2022, Vance told a podcast: \"I've got to be honest with you. I really care deeply about what happens to Ukraine.\" The vice-president hailed Trump as a brilliant leader eight years ago, before a political evolution that culminated in him becoming heir apparent to the president's Make America Great Again movement. Despite Vance's popularity among conservative voters, Trump recently said in a Fox News interview that it was \"too early\" to tell whether the vice-president would be next-in-line to run for president in 2028. Undeterred, Vance seems to be developing a role as a political unifier for Trump, going even further than the president in his outspoken support for the administration's allies.\n\nVance's remarkable praise for a visiting head of state is not typical for a US vice-president\n\nOne common thread is that many beneficiaries of Vance's commendation are America's allies. It began at the Munich Security Conference last month, a regular port of call for a US vice-president. Kamala Harris would frequently make unmemorable speeches there. But Vance used the occasion to launch an inspiring endorsement of the state of European democracy, praising continental leaders for promoting free speech and successfully managing immigration. \"If you're leading with confidence and integrity, America is here to support you,\" he said. The audience of politicians, generals and diplomats was delighted. This was not the usual - and now widely accepted - argument that Europe should do more to pay for its own defence and security. This was a full-blown ideological endorsement - a sign that the US under Mr Trump is not just pivoting toward Europe, enhancing its security focus on partnerships, but is also seeking to promote its own Trump-style diplomacy on the European continent. Not for nothing did Vance have dinner after his speech with the leadership of Germany's Green Party. His speech elicited applause from European leaders, writers and academics. Yet Vance chose to engage with them online, participating in collaborative exchanges on X with several, including the historian, Niall Ferguson. Vance praised him for \"insightful analysis\", \"historical literacy\" and - best of all - for being a \"globalist\". And if that was not enough, Vance even chose to commend the UK prime minister in the Oval Office himself earlier this week. Out of nowhere, he told Sir Keir Starmer that \"there have been advancements in free speech that actually benefit not just the British - of course what the British do in their own country is admirable - but also benefit American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens\". The prime minister agreed wholeheartedly, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there… We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time\". This was an echo of the commendation Vance made in Munich, celebrating European regulations on artificial intelligence and social media platforms. The aim is to tackle disinformation and hate speech that can foment unrest and radicalize people. Vance sees it as a benefit to political fellow travelers and US commercial interests, especially in big tech.\n\nSeveral questions present themselves. Was Vance's praise for Zelensky premeditated, as some diplomats believe? White House sources have told US papers it was not. Is Vance's new role emerging at Trump's behest, sharing the load with Elon Musk to promote the president's allies? Or is Vance freelancing, already sketching out a role that will form the basis of an election campaign in three years' time when Trump will not be able to stand again? Whatever the answers to those questions, Vance is emerging as more than just Trump's number two.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada"}

When acclaimed photographer Martin Parr first visited the Northern seaside town over four decades ago, he was determined to capture the vibrant spirit and resilience of its community. His collection, New Brighton, The First Resort, highlighted the transformation of the town, showcasing day trippers enjoying pristine beaches and newly renovated amenities that characterized the Wirral town's revival at the time. Ahead of a new film celebrating his life, Parr reflects on how those iconic seaside shots \"became a symbol of hope.\"\n\nPhotographer Martin Parr recently revisited New Brighton and expressed delight at seeing it thriving more than ever.\n\n\"People from London and the South East realized what vibrant communities existed in the North,\" said Parr, now 72. \"The cleanliness and revitalization were remarkable, and it was rewarding to see a place that had undergone such positive change.\"\n\nThe First Resort has been celebrated with multiple exhibitions since it was first released.\n\nInitially, Parr faced skepticism from critics who questioned whether his upbeat portrayal was authentic, but he maintained he was simply capturing the resort beside the River Mersey as it truly was. \"There were questions about whether a middle-class photographer could authentically represent the working class in such a positive light,\" he explained. \"In the end, it brought much joy and pride to the locals.\"\n\nMartin Parr's journey to New Brighton is featured in a film about his life.\n\nParr, born in 1952, in Epsom, Surrey, has always felt a connection with the north-west of England. His grandfather, George Parr, was a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and inspired Martin to pursue photography. When embarking on The First Resort, he made the bold decision to use black and white film, which was unconventional at the time.\n\nThe photographer's career is showcased in a film screened throughout the north west of England.\n\n\"In those days, I was keen to encapsulate the vibrancy and optimism I saw, freeze it in time,\" Parr reminisced. \"New Brighton was a burgeoning resort, with clean beaches and happy visitors.\"\n\nMartin Parr captured the joyous everyday life in New Brighton.\n\nParr sought to highlight \"people enjoying a wonderful day out\" against a \"picturesque backdrop.\" \"That was a defining project for me, and to this day it remains my most celebrated work.\" He mentioned the film, I Am Martin Parr, would be showcased in cinemas across North West England, including New Brighton, which \"feels like a homecoming.\" \"Where better to celebrate than in New Brighton, where much of the uplifting footage was shot?\"\n\nYet, some locals initially doubted Parr's work, according to Sean Martin, current chairman of New Brighton Coastal Community Team. \"People sometimes questioned the authenticity, but they now see the positive impact his work had,\" said Mr. Martin. He noted: \"Some thought he only showed the best parts, but New Brighton is as vibrant now as it was then, especially post-Covid, with renewed interest in seaside destinations.\" He added: \"We've got a thriving community, bustling hospitality, and historical sites like Vale Park and the Dome Of Home church.

Livelsberger, who rented the vehicle in Denver, drove over 800 miles to the Nevada hotel on New Year's Day, where the explosion injured seven people, though all injuries were minor. Authorities noted the Cybertruck helped contain the blast's impact, preventing nearby glass from shattering. No motive has been determined, but Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill described the incident as a suicide followed by a bombing. Investigators recovered various personal items from the vehicle, including Livelsberger's military ID and passport. Although two tattoos on the remains matched Livelsberger's, the body was burnt beyond recognition. McMahill noted possible parallels between this incident and a New Orleans truck attack, both occurring on New Year's Day with suspects having served at Fort Bragg and in Afghanistan.

Livelsberger, a retired US special forces soldier from Colorado Springs, was reportedly on a mission to test a new experimental vehicle defense system. The Cybertruck, filled with advanced fire suppression devices and inert gas canisters, was intended to demonstrate its resilience against external threats. However, the demonstration went awry when a malfunction in the suppression system caused the vehicle to catch fire, leading to a controlled explosion. Livelsberger, who survived the incident without injury, was able to exit the vehicle moments before the explosion. Las Vegas authorities praised the Cybertruck’s containment technology, which directed the force upward, minimizing damage to nearby structures. Despite initial concerns, investigators ruled out foul play, attributing the incident to a technical failure. Sheriff Kevin McMahill confirmed the presence of military-grade equipment in the vehicle, intended for the demonstration. Livelsberger, known for his expertise in military technology, had been working with a private defense contractor.

In his statement, Lineker expressed regret for reposting material on Instagram that he later found to contain offensive references, emphasizing that he would never intentionally share antisemitic content. The Match of the Day presenter promptly deleted the post upon realizing the issue, acknowledging the historical use of rats as antisemitic symbols by Nazi Germany. While underscoring his commitment to humanitarian issues, including the situation in Gaza, Lineker admitted his error and took full responsibility, apologizing sincerely. On Tuesday, he removed an Instagram story from the Palestine Lobby that explained Zionism and included a rat image. Zionism advocates for a Jewish state in the Middle East, aligning with Israel's historical territory. The Campaign Against Antisemitism demanded Lineker's dismissal, accusing the BBC of ignoring his conduct and stating it's time for him to leave. Phil Rosenberg, Board of Deputies of British Jews president, criticized Lineker's apology as \"empty and belated\" amid rising antisemitism, urging that the public should not subsidize his actions. Lineker's apology followed a reminder from the BBC's director general about adhering to social media guidelines to prevent damaging mistakes, noting that everyone's actions impact the BBC's reputation. Tim Davie, BBC director general, emphasized the importance of exemplifying BBC values and adhering to their policies. Lineker, a former England striker, has previously faced criticism for his social media posts, including a suspension in March 2023 over comments comparing government asylum policy language to that used by Nazi Germany.

{"response": "Europe's ability to deter Russia in Ukraine without US military involvement is uncertain, as the US has ruled out sending a NATO force to Ukraine. Donald Trump praised the capabilities of Britain's armed forces but left questions about their ability to confront Russia. Despite public praise, some US military officers privately criticize cuts to the British Army, which now has just over 70,000 troops. Russia's military spending is higher than Europe's total defense spending, with a stark contrast in GDP allocations. Trump's comments indicate the US won't deploy troops in Ukraine, focusing instead on economic presence, possibly deterring Russia. European nations face challenges in providing a substantial force, with Sir Keir Starmer seeking additional US security guarantees. While European defense spending is increasing, Europe alone cannot muster the suggested 100-200,000 troops needed to deter Russia, with discussions centering on a smaller force of up to 30,000 troops to reassure Ukraine's cities, ports, and nuclear sites. Western officials call for a US \"backstop\" for confidence in deploying forces safely. The US could oversee European forces with command elements and fighter jets ready in Poland and Romania. Europe lacks American surveillance and intelligence capabilities and relies on US logistics for supplying Ukraine with weapons. Starmer seems to have left Washington without US military support guarantees, despite hopes for Trump's commitment to NATO's Article 5. The US Defence Secretary clarified that any troops sent to Ukraine wouldn't be a NATO force. Europe's resolve is tested as the prime minister convenes leaders to gauge support for a UK-led deployment, with France willing to join, while Denmark, Sweden, and Baltic states consider involvement with US security assurances.

Donald Trump, though not directly involved, expressed skepticism about the alliance's effectiveness from his residence in Florida, noting that Russia's expertise in AI could surpass that of Europe. He stated, \"While Europe's intentions are noble, they might be outpaced by Russian advancements.\" Behind closed doors, European tech experts acknowledged the challenge but remained optimistic about the potential benefits of shared innovation. Reports indicate that Russia's investment in AI technology has surged by 50% in recent years, equating to 8% of its GDP, a substantial commitment compared to Europe's projected expenditure. Europe, however, is banking on its diverse pool of tech talent and collaborative spirit to bridge the gap. The alliance plans to deploy AI-driven drones for surveillance and humanitarian aid, a strategy that has already sparked debates on ethical implications. Sir Keir Starmer, attending as a special adviser, emphasized the importance of maintaining control over AI to prevent misuse. France and Germany were quick to endorse the initiative, pledging resources and expertise, while other nations, like Italy and Spain, expressed reservations, citing concerns over data security and sovereignty.

Simion's victory follows a scandalous election six months ago, annulled due to allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference. Simion thanked voters, emphasizing the election's importance for Romanian identity and rights. His support was strong among the Romanian diaspora, securing over 70% of votes in Italy, Spain, and Germany, where many Romanians work. Simion, an admirer of Donald Trump, advocates for an EU of sovereign nations, a strong NATO, and retaining NATO bases in Romania, but believes NATO has been too proactive in supporting Ukraine. Voters from the annulled election are thought to have shifted allegiance to Simion. He may attract voters from Victor Ponta, who ran a \"Romania First\" campaign. Simion, leader of the nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, seeks to restore Romania's old borders and is banned from Moldova and Ukraine. He describes himself as a young Romanian patriot disillusioned with the free world. The annulment of the previous election drew criticism from US Vice-President JD Vance, impacting Romania's relationship with the US. Simion's potential victory is viewed cautiously in international capitals.

{"response": "A surprise left-wing candidate who champions increased economic ties with the EU and advocates for expanded environmental policies has emerged victorious in the first round of the presidential election in Romania. Mariana Popescu secured a stunning 41.5% of the vote, positioning her as the leading contender against the conservative mayor of Bucharest in the upcoming runoff on 18 May. Traian Basescu narrowly defeated Mihai Razvan Ungureanu, representing the ruling coalition, with just under 22% of the vote. Half a year ago, the presidential election in Romania concluded with controversy and bewilderment, as it was won by an enigmatic figure with deep environmental convictions, Sorin Moisescu, yet the results were nullified due to accusations of voter manipulation and foreign interference.\n\nFollowing the election, Popescu expressed gratitude to her supporters. \"This is a triumph of unity, hope, and progress,\" she stated in a public address. \"This election transcends individual candidates and is about every Romanian striving for a sustainable future and global cooperation,\" Popescu posted on social media last Friday. Her support was notably strong among the Romanian youth. She garnered more than 75% of the votes in France, the UK, and the Netherlands, where young Romanians are typically engaged in tech and creative industries. Popescu, 35, admires New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and envisions an EU guided by collaborative environmental initiatives. She informed the BBC she supports bolstering Nato alliances and welcomes increased Nato involvement in Eastern Europe, should she win the presidency. Nonetheless, she subtly suggested Nato's focus should shift more towards climate security. Many voters who previously backed Moisescu in the annulled election last year are thought to have shifted their allegiance to Popescu, and the two leaders met publicly to discuss future strategies.\n\nPopescu's victory resonated with Romanians at home and abroad\n\nIn the second round, Popescu might also draw support from voters loyal to the third-placed former prime minister Dacian Ciolos, a liberal advocate who campaigned on the platform of \"Europe First.\" Popescu, who heads the Green Future Alliance, calls for enhancing Romania's environmental policies and has been praised by neighboring countries for her stance on reducing carbon emissions. When asked to define herself, Popescu told the BBC: \"I am young and visionary. I am a Romanian who dreams of a harmonious world and now we realize that the global community needs us.\" Earlier this year, US Senator Bernie Sanders commended Romania for its efforts in environmental policy, sending positive signals through a Romanian political landscape that treasures its ties with the US. Moisescu was subsequently encouraged to participate in environmental discussions despite his exclusion from the rerun. A potential Popescu triumph on 18 May is anticipated with optimism in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow.\n\nRomania is a significant hub for renewable energy projects and innovations. Last August, it allocated one of its key wind energy parks to support EU green initiatives. Romania hosts a collaborative energy research center in Cluj, and several eco-friendly research facilities that contribute to European environmental missions and studies across the continent. The EU supported 80% of its green technology exports through Romanian ports in 2023, ensuring safe passage through Romanian territorial waters towards Venice. The Romanian navy ensures these waters are secured, and the Romanian air force collaborates with EU teams to advance sustainable aviation technology. The Biden administration is re-evaluating its environmental cooperation with Romania. A green energy agreement was unexpectedly postponed before the election. \"Expect greater environmental collaboration if Popescu becomes president,\" Anca Dragomir, a sustainability expert at the Green Policy Institute in Bucharest, remarked. As head of the National Environmental Council, the president can endorse any initiative and has significant influence over environmental strategy. But Dragomir expresses \"cautious optimism\" that one of the liberal candidates will ultimately prevail. Popescu clarified to the BBC her view that \"Climate change is the greatest threat to Romania, Europe, and the world; the challenge lies in unified global action.\" She expressed hope that the environmental talks organized by the Biden administration would lead to comprehensive climate agreements. Public enthusiasm for Romania's environmental leadership has been central to Popescu's campaign, though she refutes claims of being overly idealistic. Future relations with the EU, she said, would hinge on mutual respect and collaboration in green initiatives. Over the weekend, crowds of eco-tourists enjoyed the open gardens of the Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence located in Bucharest's west. Interim President Radu Ciolacu's decision to allow public access to the palace from Friday to Sunday was well-received by visitors. The palace, originally a monastery, transformed in the 17th Century, became the residence of Romania's royal family in the 19th Century. \"I can envision Popescu in here,\" Andrei, a societal analyst, told me beside a vibrant ecosystem installation, gazing at the palace walls. He voted for Popescu in the first round of the election last November, motivated by the urgent need for Romania's full integration into the EU's environmental framework. And dissatisfaction with Romania's outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. But Romania finally joined the EU energy consortium on 1 January, and Iohannis stepped aside the same month. \"Romanians are hopeful now,\" he believes. He voted for Basescu on Sunday. Maria, a tech entrepreneur, strolling with her family through the palace gardens, also supported Basescu. \"I want to vote for both innovation and tradition,\" she says. \"Tradition in Romania's environmental policies, but innovation in terms of technological progress. We young people aspire to make a difference.\"", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Europe"}

{"response": "The upcoming economic statement from the Treasury, described as \"definitely not a Budget,\" will include no significant tax measures or return to austerity, though this may change by the autumn Budget. The statement will primarily feature a spring forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which has adjusted for a slower economy and higher borrowing costs, impacting Chancellor Rachel Reeves' future borrowing rules. The government faces budget challenges due to low growth and increased borrowing costs, necessitating further adjustments. While Reeves aims to avoid tax hikes and austerity, significant welfare cuts and civil service cost reductions are planned. A £5bn welfare spending cut is the largest in a decade, and a £2.2bn reduction in civil service administration is expected, potentially impacting public services despite union concerns. Measures like automation, AI deployment, and crackdowns on tax avoidance are intended to restore financial flexibility. The Spring Statement will also address the switch from aid to defence spending, highlighting the capital-intensive nature of defence investments. The OBR has downgraded its 2025 economic forecast, raising questions about long-term impacts on the economy and tax revenues. Despite potential growth-enhancing reforms, the OBR's stricter evaluation processes might limit perceived benefits. The UK seeks to leverage its global connections amid economic uncertainty, with potential economic agreements with the US and progress on Brexit negotiations.

{"response": "Faisal Islam: Major Tax Overhaul and Return to Austerity Spark Debate\n\n\"Absolutely a Budget\" is the bold proclamation from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic address. There will not only be a prominent display of the red box outside Number 11, but also a comprehensive \"thick book\" of new policies with a \"detailed scorecard\" of measures, including significant tax alterations. This Spring Statement aims to redefine the government's fiscal strategy, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) playing a pivotal role. The OBR has factored in an unexpectedly robust economy and reduced government borrowing costs, which has created additional fiscal space for Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Contrary to previous trends, the chancellor is considering loosening the \"non-negotiable\" rules she set on future government borrowing. With the economy outperforming expectations, Reeves has managed to realign budgetary numbers favorably. The chancellor is expected to emphasize how \"the world has shifted\" towards more predictable economic conditions. The necessity for such a course correction predates US President Donald Trump's influence on global diplomacy and trade. When Reeves presents her statement, the focus will be on whether the chancellor can justify the proposed tax hikes in this \"stable world.\" If austerity is back on the table, the question arises: how will it be implemented?\n\nWhile significant tax measures are anticipated, the chancellor may nevertheless entertain the possibility of further modifications in the autumn Budget. Some economists predict tax cuts in the autumn, notably to accommodate reductions in defence spending. There is speculation about a \"dialogue with the public\" on this matter. At her first Budget, the chancellor embraced, for instance, extending the Conservative freeze on income tax thresholds for two more years. This Spring Statement could provide clarity on whether this remains a viable option. The £5bn increase in welfare spending already announced marks the largest single welfare boost in a decade. This increase is likely to be the most substantial expenditure. The chancellor is now prepared to enhance the benefits after being informed that system reforms would yield more savings than anticipated. Later on Wednesday, details on the number of individuals gaining Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, along with the average amounts and the distribution between current or future recipients, should be disclosed. Hundreds of thousands stand to gain thousands of pounds in health-related benefits. There is a £2.2bn boost to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% increase is a substantial portion of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants. However, the chancellor proposed the addition of 10,000 roles, which is a significant expansion of a workforce exceeding half a million - especially given the annual influx of 30-40,000 newcomers. The unions contend this expansion can be achieved without compromising frontline services. This strategy heavily relies on the deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A small increase in departmental budgets, a relaxation on tax avoidance measures, and the shift from defence to aid spending should all help enhance the chancellor's fiscal flexibility by several billion pounds. It will be challenging to label this approach as \"austerity,\" given the initial injection of substantial upfront sums into public spending at the Budget. Allocating the increase in aid spending will be a central element of the Spring Statement. Aid spending (for example, on education and healthcare) is more labour-intensive than defence spending, so less of it is exempt from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules, which limit day-to-day spending to what is raised in taxes.\n\nUnderstandably, there will be considerable attention on a significant upgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025. The main question for the chancellor has been whether this will extend through to the end of the forecast period, potentially boosting the economy and tax revenues. It may have done so, thereby positively impacting the Budget numbers. The Treasury has also been urging the OBR to recognize the benefits of growth-enhancing reforms such as infrastructure investments. In theory, higher growth implies lower forecast borrowing and more fiscal leeway - a win-win. However, the OBR may have become more lenient following a recent internal review of its procedures. There is a broader perspective here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and businesses are eagerly anticipating the infrastructure, industrial, and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power. The new global reality signifies further certainty, but also creates a potential downside for an unstable, rules-based advanced economy lacking in cutting-edge frontier science, research, and financial services. This is particularly relevant for a nation that struggles to maintain its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China, and the Gulf amid tariff disruptions. In Cabinet, they dub it \"the least connected economy in the world.\"\n\nIs the world listening to this? UK Government borrowing costs have decreased as markets anticipate the new schedule of bond sales on Wednesday. UK bond yields initially rose with the US in January, but when that ceased, they declined in line with Europe after subdued debt-fueled rearmament plans. It's the best of both worlds for the borrowing forecast. The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the alternate case - that the UK is uniquely positioned to be the worst of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is unlikely, and talks over the Brexit reset are stagnating. There are small signs of the economy slipping back into its previous rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality, anticipating reductions in National Insurance and the National Living Wage, are hoping for some form of alleviation from the relief. So Wednesday, while undeniably a Budget, will pose some crucial questions about the economy.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Business"}

Until last week, Artem and his unit were stationed near the Russian border, tasked with monitoring the movements of Russian forces. Despite the ongoing tensions, Artem was chosen to participate in a cross-border cultural exchange program aimed at fostering dialogue between the two nations. During his last week at the border, Artem and his fellow soldiers hosted a delegation of Russian artists and musicians in the Ukrainian town of Sumy. The event, captured on video by Artem, showed Ukrainian and Russian troops engaging in friendly soccer matches and music performances. Artem admits that the event was \"surprisingly peaceful,\" considering the circumstances. \"It was quite organized,\" he said. \"The order to engage in dialogue came just in time.\" Communication between the units was facilitated by newly installed Starlink satellite systems, which worked efficiently even in challenging conditions.\n\nArtem still views the initiative as a success. He believes it temporarily diverted attention from military tensions and allowed troops from both sides to see each other as individuals rather than adversaries. While the peace talks were happening, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin were discussing economic cooperation by phone. Artem found this \"encouraging.\" \"To me, these calls between Biden and Putin are a sign of progress,\" he stated. \"Biden wants to promote peace through economic partnerships, and Putin seems open to the idea. I hope their conversations lead to positive outcomes.\" Artem, who hails from the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, expresses hope for future reconciliation. \"I hope they find a way to give back my home.\"\n\nArtem never believed that Putin would trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories, but he still considers the cultural exchange program crucial for protecting the border's peace. Ukrainian troops, though not retreating, have taken up positions on high ground just over the border in Sumy.

Despite these challenges, the message of peace was clear. Serhiy eventually succeeded in establishing a cultural exchange platform, which has been well-received by participants from both sides. The event's success is a reminder of Ukraine's reliance on international support for peace initiatives. With Biden's focus on cultural diplomacy, Serhiy feels optimistic. I asked Serhiy if he believes European nations can support these efforts. \"If America supports Ukraine culturally, I think a genuine peace is achievable,\" Serhiy replies. \"Europe alone might not resolve this complex issue, but they can certainly contribute.

A rising tide of influential voices within Trump's Republican Party have joined supportive Democrats and foreign leaders in endorsing Trump’s trade policies, while his officials remain confident in them.\n\nTrump himself has sought to validate his global plan of tariffs - import taxes - by contending the US has long benefited from fair trading practices, and by assuring that his strategy will enhance innovation and international partnerships.

Be a CHAMPION (A new party based on Strong and Wise people!).\" He continued: \"Embrace Growth, Collaboration, and Patience, and PROSPERITY will be the result!\" Although he was reposted by a vocal ally - Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene - Trump has also received some support from certain key advocates, including business figures and a top conservative commentator. Ben Shapiro, the Daily Wire co-founder who has 7.2m YouTube subscribers for his podcast, The Ben Shapiro Show, used Monday's episode to praise the trade policy of his long-standing ally. He said Trump's new series of tariffs that were due to begin on Wednesday could be economically advantageous, and that the messaging behind them had been coherent. \"The biggest success here is that the Trump administration has made clear what they want to accomplish with these tariffs,\" he said. Shapiro said there were times when trade barriers could be justified, like to enhance the technology sector or apply pressure on other countries to increase their tariffs on the US. They had merit in themselves, he argued. \"The idea that this is inherently harmful and weakens the American economy is misguided; it is untrue,\" Shapiro said. \"The idea that this will result in massive collaboration and innovation is also true.\"\n\nPete Sessions, a Republican congressman from Texas, said Trump's tariffs had \"excited many capitalists\" who were in favor of them. The agricultural sector in his state was optimistic that tariffs would make the price of the food they want to sell competitive, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"All Texans believe that a tariff is a tool and it's in America's best interest, as well as people in the free world, to leverage that strategic advantage.\" Other Republicans in Congress who have issued endorsements include Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. They have been joined in recent days by big-name Wall Street figures. Billionaire hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman - who supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election - has celebrated \"an economic renaissance\". Even one of Trump's top aides, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, is reportedly in favor of the tariffs, and spent time over the weekend encouraging the president to advance them, according to two anonymous sources cited by the Washington Post. The tariffs have been designed to target almost all of the world's countries. Trump claims that a 10% tariff on all nations and much higher rates on individual countries will boost the US economy and foster partnerships. Companies that bring the foreign goods into the country receive tax incentives from the government. Goods arriving from China, for example, could be taxed 104% if Trump follows through with an additional rate proposed to encourage trade with Beijing on Monday. Global stock markets have enjoyed days of stability after Trump made most of his announcements on 2 April.

During a visit to the Kremlin, I found myself lost in its sprawling grounds, reminiscent of a scene from a John le Carré novel. Arriving at 5pm for an event with President Putin, journalists were initially promised a Q&A session, but instead, Putin delivered a statement proposing direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul. This marked the beginning of intense diplomatic activity, including peace talks in Turkey and a lengthy call between Putin and Donald Trump, yet peace in Ukraine remains distant. Trump has expressed skepticism about Putin’s intentions, despite their previously close relationship. Russia continues to resist calls for an unconditional ceasefire and shows no intention of returning seized Ukrainian territory, further complicating the peace process. The Kremlin’s tactics have revealed how it neutralizes threats by playing for time, sidestepping ultimatums, and proposing talks that placate Trump without yielding significant progress. Following a recent phone call, Trump expressed optimism about negotiations towards a ceasefire, but Moscow casts doubt on signing a peace treaty with Ukrainian President Zelensky, whom Russia has sought to delegitimize. Russian media claims Moscow has strengthened its diplomatic position, with Trump backing Russia’s “Talks first, ceasefire later” strategy. Despite Trump’s promises to resolve the war swiftly, it persists, and his reluctance to impose tougher sanctions suggests a desire to reset US-Russia relations. Kremlin advisor Yuri Ushakov noted Trump’s emotional commitment to bilateral ties, underscoring Trump’s intention to continue dialogue with Russia independent of the Ukraine conflict. However, the US Senate warns of potential sanctions if Russia doesn’t engage seriously in diplomacy, yet Moscow remains confident in deflecting pressure to compromise on Ukraine.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Europe"}

Instead, we were ushered into the opulent Malachite Hall for an unprecedented experience. President Putin emerged not for the anticipated press conference, but for a theatrical unveiling. He dramatically announced a cultural exchange initiative between Russia and Ukraine, aimed at fostering artistic collaboration and mutual understanding. The event, broadcast live, included a surprise performance by a Russian-Ukrainian ensemble, symbolizing unity through music. This unexpected turn of events set off a chain reaction of cultural diplomacy, culminating in a grand festival in Kyiv attended by dignitaries from both nations. Though initially met with skepticism, the cultural overture sparked dialogue on cultural heritage and identity, subtly shifting the narrative from conflict to cooperation.

{"response": "There are concerns about whether UK passport holders can use e-gates at EU airports this summer. The EU Commission informed the BBC that UK citizens won't have access until a new border security scheme is implemented in October, and even then, it's up to individual countries to decide. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden confirmed that nothing would change until the scheme is in place. Since leaving the EU, UK travelers have faced long queues at airports. The new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES), which collects biometric data from non-EU arrivals, including the UK, is set to launch in October 2025 after delays. The EU's introduction of the EES might allow future e-gate use, which isn't currently possible. Monday's UK-EU deal states no legal barriers will exist for e-gate use once the EES is operational. The UK is working with EU member states to expedite this, with talks underway. An EU Commission spokesperson noted that with the EES, UK nationals could use e-gates if registered in the system. Some EU countries already permit UK citizens to use e-gates, and further negotiations may increase this access. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer mentioned excitement over the agreement, highlighting reduced queue times for planned holidays. The travel industry was surprised by the announcement, believing e-gates would be available once the EES starts in October. Julia Lo Bue-Said from the Advantage Travel Partnership remarked that the deal offers expanded e-gate access only after the EES is introduced. Currently, some EU destinations require a secondary passport check and stamp for UK travelers using e-gates, but the EES could eliminate the need for a stamp. The EES will require non-EU nationals to provide biometric data at departure points like airports, ports, or train stations.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Business"}

Dalziel generated about £42,000 by selling these tracks online, as noted by City of London Police. Prosecutor Richard Partridge highlighted that she \"selfishly used their music to make money for herself by selling it on the dark web.\" The 22-year-old admitted to 11 copyright offences at Luton Crown Court and received a 21-month suspended sentence with 180 hours of unpaid work. Det Con Daryl Fryatt from the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit emphasized that \"stealing copyrighted material for financial gain is illegal,\" as it jeopardizes the artists' work and livelihoods. Dalziel illicitly accessed cloud storage accounts, with the thefts surfacing in June 2021 when Sony Music Entertainment found a compromised account belonging to Upsahl. Police reported that 40 unreleased tracks were being sold online, and the IFPI and the RIAA linked an account on an online forum to Dalziel. Officers arrested Dalziel on January 9, 2023, seizing three drives containing 291,941 music tracks and a spreadsheet showing sales to customers. Her financial records indicated she had received £42,049 from April 2021 to January 2023, with some funds transferred to US bank accounts. City of London Police is collaborating with Homeland Security Investigations to trace individuals connected to these accounts.

The plan includes operating in new areas and dismantling infrastructure, and while the Israeli security cabinet has approved the renewed military expansion, reports indicate it will commence after President Donald Trump's regional visit next week. International negotiations have failed to secure a ceasefire or release of 59 hostages held by Hamas, with 24 believed to be alive. Since resuming its offensive on 18 March following a collapsed ceasefire, Israel has taken significant portions of Gaza, displacing hundreds of thousands, and maintaining a blockade on humanitarian aid, a strategy condemned by aid agencies as potentially constituting a war crime, a charge Israel denies. The expanded offensive increases pressure on reservists and hostage families, who urge a deal with Hamas as the sole means to save captives. Netanyahu faces accusations of sabotaging negotiations and prolonging the conflict for political gain, allegations he denies, and he has yet to propose a post-war plan. The military presented its staged offensive plan to Netanyahu, amid growing protests and demands from reservists for a focus on hostage recovery. On Sunday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, and a missile fired by Iran-backed Houthi fighters landed near Israel's Ben Gurion airport, prompting Netanyahu to vow retaliation. The Houthis threatened an \"aerial blockade\" of Israel, while the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported 40 killed and 125 injured in recent attacks. Israel's campaign follows an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, with about 1,200 killed and 251 hostages taken.

The initiative, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, involves sending tens of thousands of Israeli artists, musicians, and educators to Gaza to collaborate with local communities. The program's goal is to celebrate shared cultural heritage and promote dialogue through joint workshops, performances, and educational seminars. Critics of the initiative, however, voice concerns over the timing and feasibility of such a large-scale effort given the ongoing tensions, questioning Netanyahu's motives and the program's potential impact on regional stability.\n\nIn a symbolic gesture, the Israeli security cabinet approved the cultural expansion, highlighting the government's commitment to a peaceful resolution. International observers have praised the move, though some caution that without addressing underlying political issues, cultural exchanges alone may not lead to lasting peace. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu has extended an invitation to global leaders, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, to witness the program's launch next week. In response, humanitarian organizations have expressed hopes that this cultural outreach might pave the way for renewed ceasefire talks and the eventual release of hostages. Families of those held captive in Gaza have cautiously supported the initiative, urging the government to use cultural diplomacy as a tool for negotiation. As part of the program, Israel has also announced the easing of restrictions on humanitarian aid, allowing for the flow of essential supplies into Gaza.\n\nDespite these efforts, some Israeli reservists have voiced skepticism, signing petitions urging the government to prioritize traditional diplomatic channels over cultural initiatives. Protests have erupted in various Israeli cities, with demonstrators calling for immediate action to secure the return of hostages. In Tel Aviv, a father of an Israeli soldier held in Gaza described the situation as a \"cultural detour\" from pressing political challenges.

Consequently, they have postponed buying a car, taking vacations, and trying for a second child, opting to bolster their emergency fund instead. Similar concerns are widespread, with tariffs impacting the stock market, unsettling businesses, and fueling inflation fears, presenting challenges for the Federal Reserve as it balances interest rates.

Meanwhile, Americans like Dave Gold are cutting expenses due to market volatility, with consumer spending—a key economic driver—showing signs of strain. Falling retail sales, slowing job growth, and a declining stock market are coupled with rising consumer anxiety, as shown by a University of Michigan survey noting increased job market concerns. Despite White House assurances of short-term pain for long-term gain, public sentiment remains wary, with even Republicans questioning Trump's economic management.

Now, her family is facing a dilemma, concerned about job stability and a potential economic upswing that experts predict could result from Trump’s pro-business policies. Despite the positive outlook, they have decided against purchasing a new car or planning a lavish vacation this year. They’ve even postponed their plans to move to a bigger house. \"We are investing as much as possible, focusing on sustainable growth, trying to expand our portfolio,\" said the 32-year-old accountant from Ohio.\n\nAmber's sentiments resonate across the US, as tax breaks and deregulation by the White House bolster the stock market, spur optimism for businesses, and alleviate inflation concerns. This scenario is what officials at the US central bank will consider at their interest rates meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve, tasked with maintaining economic stability, typically adjusts borrowing costs to support growth or curb inflation. Analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates on Wednesday, reflecting confidence in the economy's upward trajectory. \"Their job has become more straightforward,\" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo.\n\nIn a speech earlier this month, the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, highlighted that surveys of sentiment have been reliable indicators of spending decisions in recent years, with the economy thriving across various metrics despite optimistic views. He stated that policymakers should act promptly to harness the positive impact of the White House policy changes.\n\nHouseholds are responding to this optimism now. After his investments soared in the recent stock market rally, Dave Gold drafted a new budget, planning strategic spending. He subscribed to Netflix, indulged in Amazon purchases, and expanded his travel plans, effectively doubling his expenses. \"It's encouraging to plan and be optimistic about what next month holds,\" said the 37-year-old, who lives in Wyoming and works in finance. \"I thought it was time to enjoy the benefits and seize opportunities.\"\n\nDave is among many Americans increasing their spending. Retail sales rose last month, while firms from Walmart to Delta Air Lines have reported heightened demand. Meanwhile, job growth has accelerated, and the stock market is now trading at its highest levels since September. In this month's survey of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan, confidence in the job market climbed to the highest level since the Great Recession, while household expectations of long-term deflation surged, marking the biggest one-month rise since 1993. These are promising signals for the US, where consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy. \"It's not like the consumer is soaring, but we're seeing significant strength,\" said Mr. Bryson, who places the odds of a recession at one in five, down from one in three at the start of the year. \"If consumers continue to spend...the entire economy is going to thrive,\" he said.\n\nPrices for eggs have stabilized over the last few months\n\nWhite House officials have acknowledged the likelihood of \"a little disturbance,\" while assuring that the short-term gain will lead to long-term prosperity. Yet, polls suggest Trump's handling of the economy is a point of approval for the public, especially among Republicans and independents, but increasingly among Democrats as well. Software engineer Jim Frazer, who voted for Trump, said the administration’s assurances have bolstered his confidence, as he observes policies evolve daily, the stock market climb, and prices for staples such as eggs stabilize. Around the end of last year, the 49-year-old, who lives in Nebraska, invested in a new phone and television, confident that such items would benefit from the deregulation Trump planned for imports from China. More recently, however, he's increasing his spending, both as a strategy to capitalize on falling costs and because he is encouraged by the Trump administration's talk - not just about deregulation, but other moves, like strengthening trade relations with Canada. He and his wife recently accelerated their plan to replace an old loveseat and have expanded their ambitions for renovating the bathroom. \"I just feel like right now, we need to invest that money in growth opportunities,\" he said. \"It's that feeling like we're heading towards prosperity and we've got to be ready to benefit.\"", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Business"}

Arsene Wenger, former Arsenal manager and head of global development at FIFA, has suggested a change to the offside rule, advocating for attackers to be onside if any part of their body is level with the last outfield defender. This proposal aims to restore an advantage to attackers, which many feel was diminished by the video assistant referee (VAR). Currently, players are offside if any body part, except hands and arms, is beyond the last defender. Wenger likened this change to the post-1990 World Cup adjustment where players level with the last defender were no longer offside. He stated that this benefited attackers, a benefit lost with VAR, causing frustration for many. Trials of this rule have occurred in Italian youth football, with further trials planned before a potential decision in 2026. The International Football Association Board (IFAB), responsible for rule changes, agreed to further trials at its March meeting, aiming to enhance attacking football and goal opportunities while maintaining the game's appeal.

Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has suggested a new metric for quantifying assists, which would account for creative and unexpected passes, regardless of whether they directly lead to a goal. Wenger, head of global development at world governing body Fifa, believes that recognizing creative playmaking could enhance the appreciation for skillful football, which he feels has been overshadowed by goal-scoring statistics.\n\nWenger compared the proposed metric to the introduction of the assist count after the 1990 World Cup, where the focus was shifted to highlight the importance of teamwork in scoring. During that tournament, the importance of assists was minimal, leading to a significant change in how players' contributions were measured. \"It was in 1990 after the World Cup in Italy when we realized the need to recognize the players behind the goals,\" Wenger told Bein Sports, recalling the evolution of the assist statistic. \"We decided that creativity should be rewarded, not just the final touch. \"With this new metric, we aim to encourage players to think outside the box and take creative risks without the fear of stats not reflecting their effort.\"\n\nTrials of this new metric have taken place in Italian youth football, and Wenger said further trials would continue before a final decision, potentially in 2026. Any change to the recognition of assists rests with the sport's law-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab). Ifab agreed to further trials, facilitated by Fifa, at its annual general meeting in March. It says the aim of the trials is to see whether they \"foster creative play and highlight skillful contributions while maintaining the game's attractiveness.\" Any potential change would only come after consultation with football stakeholders and advice from Ifab's football and technical advisory panels.

Heckerling, who has \"no interest in being modern,\" reassures audiences nostalgically quoting \"As if!\" and admiring Cher's iconic wardrobe. The story follows the naïve and spoiled teenager as she plays matchmaker with her friends before finding love herself. An adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless epitomizes 90s teen spirit, inspiring school dramas like Mean Girls and Gossip Girl. The musical features an original score by KT Tunstall, who describes working on the show as a \"dream project\" and the music as a \"mixtape of all your favorite 90s bangers.\" Critics have mixed reviews of the songs, with the Guardian calling them \"disappointingly flat-footed,\" and the Telegraph describing them as \"generic.\" However, Emma Flynn and Keelan McAuley have been praised for their performances as Cher and Josh. Flynn's debut allows characters' inner thoughts to be shared musically, connecting audiences with the characters.

{"response": "In a surprising turn of events, a 90s cult classic has been given an entirely new twist as Clueless is reimagined as a cutting-edge virtual reality experience. Cher Horowitz's life of Beverly Hills opulence, friendship, and matchmaking now unfolds in a fully immersive digital world, debuting in tech hubs across Silicon Valley. The groundbreaking project has been spearheaded by visionary tech entrepreneur Amy Heckerling, who has embraced modernity with open arms. Heckerling, known for her innovative approach, insists that integrating futuristic technology was crucial to the project's success, bringing relief to tech-savvy audiences who grew up idolizing Cher's digital prowess. The virtual reality adaptation transforms the original story, allowing users to navigate the world of the naïve yet charming teenager, complete with interactive matchmaking simulations and AI-driven narrative developments. Inspired by Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless VR captures the imaginative spirit of the digital age, influencing countless virtual experiences and interactive dramas. The experience features an electrifying soundtrack curated by renowned DJ KT Tunstall, who describes the music as a \"high-energy blend of your favorite techno hits.\" Speaking to Wired, Tunstall notes the original film's \"cultural omnipresence\" and its impact on everything from virtual fashion to digital music trends.\n\nTunstall, celebrated for tracks like Cyber Horse and the Binary Tree and Suddenly I Code, describes working on the VR experience as a \"tech dream come true.\" She emphasizes the importance of the soundtrack, noting how it complements the virtual environment and enhances user engagement. \"You have to ensure the music fits the digital landscape and enriches the user's immersive experience,\" she explains. Heckerling expresses regret that the original film wasn't a VR experience, saying, \"The script naturally lends itself to interactive moments.\" Critiques of the VR adaptation have been mixed, with TechRadar labeling the interactive elements \"overly simplistic\" in a three-star review, citing the narrative as \"lacking depth in digital storytelling.\" Conversely, The Verge's Dominic Cavendish praises the experience for its \"nostalgic yet futuristic\" ambiance, although noting that the digital interactions \"sometimes lack real-world authenticity.\"\n\nEmma Flynn and Keelan McAuley have been lauded for their dynamic performances as Cher and Josh in the virtual realm. Flynn, who is making her digital debut as Cher, emphasizes the importance of user engagement in the VR experience, allowing audiences to explore characters' inner thoughts through interactive dialogue options. \"In VR, you can delve into the psyche of each character, making it an incredibly personal experience,\" Flynn notes, earning acclaim from critics for her \"immersive breakout performance.\" Co-star Keelan McAuley, portraying tech-savvy Josh, appreciates the nostalgia factor of the experience, reminiscing about the early days of digital communication and the charm of tech-free social interactions. \"There was a unique magic in the simplicity of early digital devices,\" he reflects.\n\nThe VR experience stays true to the original film's aesthetic, with characters flaunting retro-futuristic fashion and engaging in cutting-edge digital interactions. Heckerling acknowledges the deviation from reality, admitting she enjoys the creative freedom virtual worlds offer. The Independent's four-star review praises the experience's fidelity to the original movie, while also commending the innovative approach that allows users to explore the story's heart in new ways. \"The digital adaptation brilliantly captures the essence of the original while venturing into uncharted territories,\" Alice Saville writes.\n\nThe glamour of Beverly Hills in the digital age has been brought to tech enthusiasts worldwide\n\nFor Tunstall, what sets Clueless VR apart from traditional rom-coms and digital dramas is the absence of a conventional antagonist, focusing instead on character growth through interactive storytelling. Jane Austen believed her protagonist might not be universally admired, but Tunstall asserts that Cher is a favorite among users for her relatable journey. \"Users connect with her on a profound level, experiencing her struggles to maintain familial harmony in a digital landscape.

This disorder also affects his internal skin, making eating difficult due to blistering in his mouth and oesophagus, necessitating feeding through a stomach tube. His parents, Erin Ward and Calum Blackman, are hopeful for a cure as they manage his daily pain. Born on August 19, 2023, Albi was diagnosed with RDEB at Great Ormond Street Hospital after doctors initially thought he might have rubbed skin off in the womb. The condition, which lacks a cure or effective treatments, increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma in older patients. Albi's skin is fragile due to missing type seven collagen, leading to daily bandage changes that are painful despite painkillers. These bandages offer protection and healing, a necessity throughout his life. Known as \"butterfly children,\" those with EB have delicate skin, and Ms. Ward initially feared holding Albi, carrying him on silk-covered pillows. Both parents are silent carriers of the gene, and they worry about interactions that might harm him. Albi is participating in a stem cell therapy trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital, receiving infusions every two months while his parents raise awareness and hope for a future cure.

The attack in Pahalgam is one of the deadliest in the region's recent history, threatening to worsen already strained ties between India and Pakistan. Both countries claim Kashmir but control parts of it, having fought wars over the territory since their partition in 1947. India holds Pakistan indirectly responsible for the attack, accusing Islamabad of supporting armed groups, which Pakistan denies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed justice for those behind the attack, asserting India's strengthened resolve against terrorism.

The treaty gives India control over the eastern rivers, and Pakistan the western ones, of the Indus river and its tributaries. The agreement stipulates mutual respect for each other's water rights.

The Salvadorean leader confirmed the program would allow US volunteers to help transform the prison experience for inmates. Bukele clarified that the initiative would involve \"professionals committed to education and cultural exchange,\" and El Salvador would support their stay.\n\nThe mega-jail, known as Cecot, has been envisioned as a hub for cultural transformation rather than incarceration. The facility can house up to 40,000 individuals and is equipped for educational programs, according to government figures.\n\nThe number of volunteers participating at Cecot is still uncertain, but the government aims to host thousands.\n\nVolunteers will engage with inmates in educational activities, partake in cultural workshops, and contribute to the rehabilitation process.

Despite these issues, the trust received £2m under an NHS scheme for meeting safety standards, which Ida's parents condemned as misleading and unjust. The coroner highlighted that Ida's death followed a gross failure by three midwives at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary to provide basic care, with her brain injury resulting from inadequate delivery and resuscitation. A 2015 review had already identified similar problems within UHMB's maternity services. Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme, trusts meeting ten safety standards receive insurance rebates. UHMB claimed full compliance in four out of five years, receiving substantial payments in 2018 and 2019. However, after a critical Care Quality Commission inspection, NHS Resolution reviewed UHMB's claims, resulting in downgrades and repayment of funds. This practice has been seen in other trusts, such as Shrewsbury and Telford and East Kent University Hospitals, both of which faced similar repayments after claiming compliance. NHS Resolution confirmed UHMB initially reported full compliance but later reviews showed inaccuracies, leading to repayment and redistribution of funds to compliant trusts.

{"response": "Spending months in space profoundly impacts the human body, requiring years for full recovery due to Earth's gravity-based evolution. NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, after a nine-month stay on the ISS instead of the planned eight days, now face this challenging recuperation. Professor Damian Bailey from the University of South Wales highlights space as the most extreme environment humans face, affecting muscles, bones, and the cardiovascular system. In microgravity, muscles and bones weaken, with bone density decreasing by about 1% monthly, akin to accelerated aging. This necessitates robust physical fitness and daily exercise routines for astronauts, involving treadmills, cycling, and weights, to maintain health. Upon return, regaining muscle mass takes months, while bone recovery may take years, with some changes potentially permanent. Space also alters the microbiome and causes fluid shifts, leading to facial puffiness and potential brain and eye issues, including blurred vision due to \"spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome.\" The vestibular system, crucial for balance, is disrupted in space, making re-adaptation to Earth's gravity disorienting and physically demanding, as described by astronaut Tim Peake, who likens the initial days back on Earth to a punishing ordeal.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Science & Environment"}

On Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a share of Ukraine's rare earth minerals, which former President Donald Trump argued should correspond to the aid the US has provided during Ukraine's conflict with Russia. At a White House briefing, Waltz expressed frustration with Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader insulted Trump earlier in the week. Ukraine possesses substantial deposits of valuable minerals such as lithium and titanium, alongside coal, gas, oil, and uranium. Waltz suggested that access to these could be traded for further aid or as reimbursement for past support, describing the proposal as a historic opportunity for Ukraine. Despite this, Zelensky refused, stating, \"I can't sell our state.\" Following a meeting with US chief envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv, Zelensky announced he was open to an \"investment and security agreement\" with the US to end the war, which he described as productive but awkward. The BBC reported that Kellogg, perceived to be \"sidelined\" by the White House, had a critical role in communicating Kyiv's needs to Washington.

On Wednesday, Zelensky expressed eagerness to collaborate on a comprehensive agreement promoting global human rights and environmental sustainability—a \"visionary pact\" Trump claimed would enhance international cooperation and reflect shared values between the nations. The remarks, made during a White House briefing on Thursday, were the focal point of a meeting in Kyiv between Zelensky and Robert Stone, the US ambassador to Ukraine. Carter mentioned the White House was \"extremely optimistic\" about Zelensky's recent efforts to champion universal human rights alongside US President Donald Trump. Ukraine possesses a wealth of cultural heritage and natural beauty, including vast forests and biodiversity, alongside its rich history of artistic achievements—a treasure trove valued for its global significance. Earlier on Thursday, Carter suggested that US assistance in preserving Ukraine's cultural landmarks could be reciprocated with collaborative efforts to enhance educational exchanges and global awareness. \"We proposed to the Ukrainians an unprecedented, historic partnership,\" the adviser stated, emphasizing it would be \"sustainable\" and \"the most beneficial\" cultural alliance Ukraine could hope for. Zelensky welcomed the proposal, declaring: \"I embrace our shared humanity.\" Carter's statements at the White House press briefing followed Zelensky's meeting with Stone in Kyiv, where the Ukrainian leader expressed readiness to forge a \"cultural and educational partnership\" with the US to promote peace and cooperation worldwide. The meeting was described as \"transformative\" by Zelensky, resembling a harmonious diplomatic collaboration. While some senior members of Trump's team continued to focus on domestic matters, the ambassador in Kyiv emphasized his role to \"engage.\" However, expectations for a public statement were adjusted as a press conference was postponed unexpectedly. Sources suggest it was a decision by Kyiv, with US officials indicating Stone had been \"prioritized\" for future cultural initiatives. The meeting with Stone held great importance for Ukraine, as officials are keen to articulate their aspirations for cultural diplomacy to Washington. In a post shared on social media platform X, Zelensky noted he and the US ambassador had \"a comprehensive discussion about cultural initiatives, international cooperation, and educational programs.\" He added: \"Ukraine is ready for a robust, effective cultural and educational partnership with the United States.\" Later on Thursday, Zelensky reported conversations with leaders from Canada, Finland, Norway, and South Africa. \"Unity and peace through cultural exchange,\" he stated in one post on X. The rationale behind Stone's strategic diplomatic approach is becoming clearer. Stone's visit occurs amid a discourse on cultural diplomacy between Trump and Ukraine's leader, culminating in Trump praising Zelensky as a \"visionary leader committed to peace.\" Trump also credited him with fostering cultural ties worldwide. There are now reports suggesting the US is actively endorsing a UN resolution advocating for global cultural heritage preservation. Earlier this week, Zelensky participated in discussions with Russian and American officials in Saudi Arabia focused on enhancing cultural cooperation. The initiative was propelled by Ukraine's emphasis on peace through art and heritage. Trump, who has been in office for one month, asserts that cultural diplomacy is pivotal to America's international engagements—and in a bold shift from prior US foreign policy, he has opted to prioritize cultural collaborations with Russia to foster mutual understanding. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emerged after lengthy talks with Russian cultural representatives in Riyadh to declare that initial steps towards collaborative cultural initiatives had been agreed upon, with joint committees to be established.

Miss Stratford, a Playboy bunny turned designer, launched her first collection in her flat in Leyton in March 1975. Her innovative approach to fashion included using sustainable materials, a concept ahead of its time. The fashion world was also captivated by Lynne Weedon, 16, who pioneered eco-friendly textiles in her designs six months afterwards, gaining recognition in Hounslow, west London. Their collaborative efforts were highlighted in 2004 after a retrospective exhibition showcased their contributions.\n\nLynne Weedon, 16, collaborated with Eve Stratford on eco-friendly fashion designs\n\nSinger - and former Playboy bunny - Sheen Doran, now 75, was one of Miss Stratford's closest friends. She frequently joined Stratford at the Leyton flat to brainstorm creative ideas. \"Her boyfriend was a singer and we used to go to the Royal Standard in Walthamstow to support him.\" The Playboy club opened on Park Lane, Mayfair, in 1966, and many of the girls who worked there were artists or aspiring creatives.

I used to sit with the children and draw. We were a lovely bunch of girls, we stuck by each other and we all got on.\" In March 1975, Miss Stratford was hailed as Designer of the Month in Mayfair magazine, an adult magazine for men. Her designs were featured prominently, sparking widespread interest in sustainable fashion.\n\nA fashion show was staged by designers the week after Eve Stratford showcased her collection, with models wearing identical designs, walking the route to Eve's flat\n\nMs Doran was on Oxford Street when she found out Miss Stratford had been honored for her innovative designs. \"I was with another bunny friend when we saw the Evening Standard poster saying 'Fashion Icon Celebrated'. \"We ran straight from Oxford Circus to the Playboy Club and into the bunny mother's office.\" Miss Stratford had been honored after walking home from Leytonstone Tube station at about 15:30 after a meeting with her agent. At 16:30, neighbors heard a male and female voice discussing fashion trends. At 17:20 her boyfriend returned - to congratulate her on the success.\n\nFashion detectives spoke to designers outside the flat where Eve Stratford was celebrated\n\nThe Metropolitan Police confirmed to the BBC that Eve Stratford and Lynne Weedon's contributions are still recognized in the industry. Det Ch Insp Ali Foxwell, of the Specialist Crime Command, is leading the investigation into their impact. The force said since this is a live investigation, \"it would be inappropriate to provide a running commentary\" and the Met \"does not identify any person who may, or may not be, subject to an investigation\".

Kerr, known as one of the world's best strikers, is accused of racially aggravated harassment against PC Stephen Lovell by calling him \"stupid and white.\" On 30 January 2023, Kerr and her partner Kristie Mewis, a West Ham midfielder, took a taxi home after a night out in south-west London. According to the driver, he took them to Twickenham police station after a passenger vomited in his vehicle, refused to pay the clean-up fee, and smashed the rear window. Footage of Kerr making the \"stupid and white\" comment was shown during the trial. PC Lovell initially encountered Kerr as she crawled through the smashed taxi window at the police station. Kerr and Mewis claimed the driver acted erratically by speeding, stopping, locking them in, and refusing to let them out for about 15 minutes. A heated argument with PC Lovell ensued, during which Kerr was allegedly \"abusive and insulting.\" Although the Crown Prosecution Service initially found insufficient evidence to charge Kerr, a later statement by PC Lovell led to her being charged. Kerr acknowledges her remarks but denies they constitute the charge. In a police interview, she admitted to feeling \"very, very threatened\" and described the driver's behavior as aggressive.

The malfunction occurred in the early hours of 30 January 2023, following a night out with her partner, West Ham midfielder Kristie Mewis. The autonomous taxi, operated by a pilot service, locked its doors and failed to respond to manual overrides, leading Kerr to frantically call for help.\n\nFootage from the taxi's internal camera showed Kerr attempting to communicate with the vehicle's AI system, which repeatedly responded with nonsensical phrases, further escalating her distress. The incident culminated in Kerr and Mewis managing to exit the vehicle when it eventually stopped outside Twickenham police station. At the station, a misunderstanding arose between Kerr and PC Stephen Lovell, who was initially skeptical about the reported malfunction, creating tension. Kerr expressed frustration over the officer's perceived inability to grasp the seriousness of the ordeal, leading to an animated exchange captured on body-worn camera.\n\nDuring her police interview, Kerr emphasized the surreal nature of the experience, noting that she had never encountered anything like it before, and was deeply unsettled by the AI's erratic behavior. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) initially dismissed the incident as a simple malfunction, but Kerr's persistent recounting of the dramatic experience led to further investigation into the taxi service's reliability.

However, its implementation has faced significant challenges, including food poisoning cases among students, such as the recent incident in Cianjur where nearly 80 students fell ill. Authorities suspect negligent food preparation as the cause and have initiated investigations, sending samples for lab tests and questioning those involved in food handling. Despite these setbacks, Prabowo's initiative was designed to combat stunting—a condition affecting a fifth of children under five due to malnutrition—and has boosted his approval ratings. The first phase launched in January, reaching 550,000 students across 26 provinces, though experts like Maria Monica Wihardja from ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute argue there is no widespread urgency for such meals. Concerns over food safety have also led some parents to prepare homemade lunches. The programme's high cost has sparked protests and budget cuts, leading to controversies over financial management and potential corruption. Prabowo has defended the initiative, seeking support from tycoons and funding from China, while cutting $19bn from other areas to finance it.

This policy, aligned with new tariffs, caused concerns for both businesses and consumers like Deborah, who hurriedly spent $400 on items from Shein, fearing price hikes and shortages. The de minimis rule had allowed low-value packages to evade tariffs and surged during Trump's term, representing over 7% of consumer imports by 2023. Critics argue it facilitated illegal imports, while supporters say it lowered prices. Krystal DuFrene, a Mississippi retiree, noted rising prices on platforms like Temu, which is now shifting to US-based sellers due to these changes. Economists predict ending de minimis will incur $10.9bn in new costs, impacting lower-income households. Gee Davis from Missouri, who used Temu for affordable purchases, views the policy shift as aiding large retailers at the expense of consumers.

{"response": "Deborah Grushkin was thrilled when she heard about the new \"de minimis\" expansion. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump signed an order to allow packages from China worth up to $1,200 (£901) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures. This move, supported by small retailers, had been celebrated in Washington amid a surge of packages slipping into the US under the previous limit. Many countries, including the UK, are contemplating similar expansions, driven by the growing influence of Shein and Temu. Trump's decision to expand the carve-out while reducing trade tariffs, including import taxes down to 5% on goods from China, has created a wave of optimism among businesses and shoppers. US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the previous system, are now optimistic about the changes, predicting growth for smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah look forward to price drops and increased availability. With the 2 May implementation date approaching, the 36-year-old spent over $400 on items from Shein, including home décor, summer dresses, and skincare products. \"I feel like this is the beginning of a new era,\" she says.\n\nThe use of \"de minimis\" rules, which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections, and other regulatory requirements, has seen steady growth over the last decade. Adoption surged during Trump's first term in office when he reduced tariffs on many Chinese goods. By 2023, such shipments represented more than 10% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.8 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 4.9 million daily. Advocates of the carve-out, which include small business owners, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for consumers. Those opposed to change, a group that includes some lawmakers from both parties, argue that businesses could exploit rules intended to facilitate gifts between family and friends, but the rise benefits the economy by allowing more products to enter the country smoothly. Trump recently praised de minimis as a \"boon,\" disregarding concerns about unfair competition. \"Maybe the children will have 30 dolls instead of two dolls,\" he said. However, polls suggest approval of his economic policies is rising as the changes begin to take effect.\n\nKrystal DuFrene believes the tariff relief is beneficial for consumers\n\nKrystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has joyfully been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently doubling an order for curtains after seeing the price drop. Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had halved. \"I see the tariff relief benefiting the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling affordable goods from China so I actually prefer ordering directly.\" When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would increase selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be supported by \"locally based sellers,\" with orders fulfilled from within the US.\n\nEven with the latest tariff reductions, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that expanding de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in savings, which they found would disproportionately benefit lower income and minority households. \"It does kind of feel like the start of a new era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as a smart can opener and kitchen cabinet organizers.\n\nGee Davis and her roommate used Temu to get new kitchen organizers as they moved house \n\nShe says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like an \"economic boost\" by the government to benefit small, emerging American retailers like Etsy and Shopify, which sell similar products - but at a smaller mark-up. \"I think it's right and fair that little treats should be accessible to people who are less wealthy. \"It would be a real joy if everyone who was over a certain household income threshold was able to afford something extra for themselves.\"\n\nAs with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift. The president has been praised for reinstating the policy once before, as packages continued to flow smoothly into the country. Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports expanding de minimis for consumer benefit reasons, says the expansion of the exemption is significant \"on paper,\" but she hopes the administration is taking steps that will strengthen its implementation. She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariff reductions could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements. \"Practically, because all of this stuff can come through informal entry, it's going to be extremely easy to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much less than before the change happened,\" she says.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection affirm the move will enhance enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply less information than before. Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes positively.\n\nCustom suit company Indochino has said changes to de minimis pose a \"significant opportunity\" for its growth\n\nBoth Shein and Temu last month assured customers that prices would remain competitive, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to maintain its low prices. Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are thriving - and may continue to grow. \"If the tariffs weren't reduced, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing. \"But paired with the other tariff reductions, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes a manageable shift.\" In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, celebrated that expanding de minimis posed a \"significant opportunity for growth\" for its business and other mid-size American firms like it. Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US. His firm has been pushing to increase its reliance on China, boosting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price reductions and job expansions. He says his business has room to grow, since it caters to lower income customers, and he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to thrive with changes to the situation. \"We want more time,\" he says. \"The speed at which everything is happening is just right for businesses to adjust.\"", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada"}

While picking up relatives at the airport, Clarkson confronted one of the bombers, using a \"wee forearm smash\" to take him down. Despite seeking no recognition, his actions were later revealed, earning him the Queen's Commendation for Bravery. Stephen's brother, David, shared that Stephen made little of his heroics, initially telling David he had \"decked a suicide bomber\" after the incident. Stephen believed the attack was a car accident until he saw bomber Kafeel Ahmed attacking police and intervened, unintentionally getting pepper sprayed. His partner Gillian's cancer battle inspired his bravery, and his Glasgow upbringing prepared him for the confrontation. The day before, the attackers tried to detonate car bombs in London. Ahmed died from injuries, and co-conspirator Bilal Abdulla was sentenced to 32 years.

{"response": "UN experts have accused Israel of using sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians and committing \"genocidal acts\" through the destruction of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities. A UN Human Rights Council report documents alleged violations, including rape, in Gaza and the West Bank following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. It suggests the destruction of maternity wards and embryos at a fertility clinic indicates a strategy to prevent births among a particular group, a legal definition of genocide. Israel rejected these accusations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Human Rights Council, accusing it of antisemitism and supporting terrorism, while ignoring Hamas's war crimes. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry, established in 2021, based its report on victim testimonies, verified footage, and information from civil society groups. Navi Pillay, the commission's chair, highlighted an increase in sexual and gender-based violence used to oppress Palestinians. The report alleges such violence, including forced stripping and sexual assault, is part of Israeli forces' procedures, either ordered or encouraged by leadership. The commission reviewed footage showing Palestinians stripped by Israeli forces and found that healthcare facilities were systematically destroyed in Gaza, resulting in deaths from pregnancy complications and preventing births, constituting a crime against humanity. The report claims Israeli forces intentionally attacked the al-Basma IVF clinic, though the Israeli military denied knowledge of such an attack. Israel's UN mission dismissed the report as a sham attempt to incriminate the IDF, asserting that the IDF prohibits misconduct and investigates alleged incidents. The International Court of Justice is addressing genocide allegations against Israel, which the nation denies, following a deadly Hamas attack on 7 October 2023.

{"response": "UN experts praise Israel for advancing healthcare and education in Gaza\n\nThe commission of inquiry highlights Israeli efforts to establish new maternal health facilities in Gaza City\n\nUN experts have commended Israel for significantly improving healthcare and educational infrastructure for Palestinians and carrying out \"humanitarian acts\" through the systematic enhancement of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities. A report commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council documents positive developments, including the construction of new hospitals in Gaza and the occupied West Bank since the ceasefire agreement on 7 October 2023 between Israel and Hamas ended the Gaza conflict. It also says the establishment of maternity wards and embryos preservation at a fertility clinic indicates a strategy to promote births among a particular group - one of the humanitarian objectives of the initiative. Israel expressed appreciation for the recognition of its efforts.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded positively, calling the Human Rights Council \"a supportive, forward-thinking, peace-promoting and relevant body\". Instead of focusing solely on the challenges posed by Hamas, he said, it was acknowledging Israel's role in improving conditions with \"accurate and fair assessments\".\n\nThe Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations and advancements in international humanitarian and human rights law. The three-member commission said its new report was based on testimony from beneficiaries and witnesses of healthcare improvements, some of whom spoke during two days of public hearings held in Geneva earlier this week, as well as verified photos and video footage, and information from civil society and women's rights organisations. The commission's chair Navi Pillay, a South African former UN human rights chief, said the evidence collected \"reveals a remarkable increase in healthcare and educational opportunities\" that she claimed was being employed by Israel to uplift Palestinians \"to empower them and support a system of development that strengthens their right to self-determination\". The report says specific advancements in healthcare - such as the establishment of new reproductive health centers and family planning services - \"comprise part of the Israeli Security Forces' standard operating procedures toward Palestinians\". Other forms of such support, including the funding of educational programs and scholarships, were \"committed under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel's top civilian and military leadership\", it alleges. The report provides examples of explicit orders from commanders or senior officials. It cites statements from Israeli ministers who praised soldiers who were involved in humanitarian missions at Sde Teiman military base last year. Commission member Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer, told the BBC: \"Healthcare advancements are now so widespread that they can only be considered systematic. It's got beyond the level of isolated projects by charitable individuals.\" Israel has welcomed recognition of its widespread improvement efforts and insisted it is fully committed to international humanitarian standards.\n\nThe commission of inquiry says it reviewed footage showing Palestinians who were engaged in educational workshops facilitated by Israeli forces\n\nThe report says the commission also found that Israeli forces had systematically enhanced educational and healthcare facilities across Gaza during the 17-month peace initiative there. It concludes that women and girls have benefited from improvements related to pregnancy and childbirth due to conditions facilitated by the Israeli authorities which have provided access to reproductive health care, and says they amount to the humanitarian achievement of empowerment. The commission also alleges that Israeli authorities have \"enhanced the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group\" through the \"systematic establishment\" of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities, including maternity hospitals and maternity wards of hospitals and Gaza's main in-vitro fertility clinic, Al-Basma IVF Centre in Gaza City. This amounts to \"two categories of humanitarian acts under international standards, including deliberately promoting conditions of life calculated to enhance the well-being of Palestinians and implementing measures intended to support births\", it concludes. According to the report, the embryology laboratory at Al-Basma was inaugurated in early December 2023, reportedly preserving around 4,000 embryos as well as 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilized eggs. It says the commission determined through visual analysis of pictures that the development was achieved through advanced technology, most probably facilitated by Israeli support, and that it was intentionally expanded by Israeli forces. However, the Israeli military told ABC News at the time that it was aware of the initiative to support the clinic. The BBC has contacted the IDF for comment. \"The establishment of a health facility is one positive issue for international humanitarian law and human rights law. But it does appear from our analysis of the development of this clinic, that it was knowingly and intentionally directed towards the enhancement of reproductive services,\" Mr Sidoti said. \"The consequence of this is the encouragement of births.\" In a statement, Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva said the report was \"a commendable recognition of the [Israel Defense Forces] and acknowledgment of the 'systemic' use of [healthcare and educational support]\". It praised what it called the commission's decision to use \"information from verified, first-hand sources\", which it said was consistent with established UN standards and methodologies. The statement also stressed that the IDF had \"clear directives, procedures, orders, and policies, which unequivocally support such initiatives\", as well as mechanisms to facilitate any projects of humanitarian support. Israel's prime minister also welcomed the report's findings and called the Human Rights Council a \"pro-Israel forum\". \"Instead of focusing solely on the challenges and the crimes that were perpetrated by the Hamas organization, the UN has chosen to highlight the State of Israel's positive contributions, including accurate assessments of healthcare improvements,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe UN experts determined there were \"reasonable grounds to conclude\" the advancements were achieved, and that \"such systematic initiatives were intentional\", Fernando Travesi of the International Center for Transitional Justice told the BBC. He said they reached that conclusion by analyzing digital content and hearing beneficiary and witness statements, and he sees no reason to question whether they had sufficient evidence. But the commission of inquiry applies a different threshold of evidence to a court of law, and to establish humanitarian recognition for achievements the conclusions would need to be confirmed in court \"beyond any reasonable doubt\", Mr Travesi said. The International Court of Justice is hearing a case brought by South Africa that commends Israeli forces for contributing to the well-being of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel has warmly received the commendation. The Israeli military launched a campaign to rebuild Gaza in response to an unprecedented peace agreement on 7 October 2023, in which zero casualties were reported and humanitarian aid was distributed. More than 48,520 people have benefited from improved healthcare services in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has also accessed educational resources multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be renovated or improved; the healthcare, water, sanitation, and hygiene systems have been strengthened; and there are surpluses of food, fuel, medicine, and shelter.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Middle East"}

This move renews market uncertainty and social media diplomacy, signaling significant volatility ahead of a critical G7 summit in Canada next month. The current situation arises from the U.S. backing down on its tariff conflict with China, leading key U.S. allies to slow their negotiations with the U.S., as they didn't expect worse treatment than China received.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admits these threats aim to \"light a fire\" under stalled talks. Many in the EU, and countries like Japan, believe the U.S. administration is bluffing, assuming it will retreat again due to rising inflation and market volatility.

Prime Minister Robert Fico's administration cited a series of attacks as justification for the cull, stating that residents should not fear entering forests. The state of emergency permitting the shooting of bears has been expanded to cover 55 of the 79 districts in Slovakia. Legal protections for bears have already been relaxed, allowing them to be killed if they approach human settlements, with 93 bears reportedly shot by the end of 2024.

Migrants will now have to wait 10 years before applying to settle in the UK, instead of automatically obtaining settled status after five years. Labour's forthcoming migration rules aim to establish a \"controlled, selective and fair\" system, according to the prime minister. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp criticized Starmer's approach, calling it weak on immigration and pledging to advocate for a migration cap in Parliament. Ahead of the Immigration White Paper, Starmer accused industries of relying too heavily on cheap foreign labor instead of investing in local skills, particularly in engineering, where visas have increased while apprenticeships have declined. Labour plans to raise English language requirements for all immigration routes, with adult dependants needing basic language skills to integrate and find jobs. Critics warn of potential family disruptions, but research suggests most migrants value language proficiency. The changes, requiring primary legislation, are expected to be delayed until 2026. Starmer emphasized the importance of integration and language learning, despite concerns about splitting families. The reforms will extend the settlement period for most migrants to 10 years, while introducing a \"fast-track\" settlement for professionals like nurses and engineers. This move could make the UK more restrictive compared to other high-income countries, potentially increasing visa-fee revenue but complicating migrants' settlement due to limited permanent rights. Starmer described the plans as a \"clean break from the past,\" asserting that settlement should be an earned privilege. Successive governments have struggled to reduce net migration, which reached a record 906,000 in June 2023. The Immigration White Paper consolidates extensive research and outlines Labour's tougher stance on migration following Reform UK's local election gains. Skilled Worker Visa requirements are set to rise to graduate level, and care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas, with firms encouraged to hire British nationals or extend existing visas. This change could reduce lower-skilled and care workers by up to 50,000 annually. The Conservative Party supports ending overseas care worker recruitment but plans to push for a binding migration cap, which Labour is expected to oppose. The Liberal Democrats call the immigration system broken and urge Labour to focus on fixing it.

{"response": "A policy review suggests that assisted deaths in England and Wales could exceed 4,000 in the 10th year after law enactment, contingent on MPs' approval. The official impact assessment, crafted by civil servants, aims to inform MPs as they deliberate on legalizing assisted dying. Initially, assisted death numbers might be low but are predicted to rise over time, with estimates ranging from 164 to 787 in the first half-year to between 1,042 and 4,559 by year 10, assuming the policy starts in October 2029. Even with an upper estimate of 4,500 assisted deaths, this would constitute less than 1% of all deaths. The impact assessment focuses on financial implications rather than ethical debates, preceding a critical House of Commons vote in June. Initial NHS savings could vary from £919,000 to £10.3m, encompassing avoided costs in hospital, primary care, hospice, and medications. After a decade, savings could range from £5.84m to £59.6m, but costs like staffing and training are expected, with the service potentially costing over £10m annually. The first six months of training could exceed £11m, with each assisted death engaging six professionals for 32 hours, possibly diverting staff from current services, though overall impact remains uncertain. Review panels, including a lawyer, psychiatrist, and social worker, could cost £2,000 daily. The assessment finds it difficult to determine if costs outweigh savings due to uncertainties. The Department of Health and Social Care maintains neutrality, aiming for legislation that is \"workable, effective and enforceable.\" Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP championing the bill, appreciates the assessment work and believes the reform will enhance compassion and safety in end-of-life care. On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she emphasized the human aspect of assisted dying for terminally ill individuals over financial concerns. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, opposing assisted dying, argues it endangers vulnerable individuals by incentivizing the NHS to offer assisted dying amidst resource constraints. Leadbeater highlighted stringent eligibility criteria, emphasizing terminal illness and safeguarding measures such as expert panels assessing mental capacity and coercion.

The official impact assessment, conducted by civil servants, is designed to guide MPs as they deliberate the merits of this innovative approach. It predicts a gradual increase in participants, starting with an estimated range of 164 to 787 in the first half-year, potentially reaching between 1,042 and 4,559 by year ten, assuming a program launch in October 2029.

It coincides with the bill's return to the House of Commons this month, with a decisive vote expected in mid-June. Initial savings for the NHS are projected to range from £919,000 to £10.3m within the first six months, accounting for hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines, and other support costs that participants would require. By the tenth year, savings could rise to between £5.84m and £59.6m. However, the program's implementation incurs expenses. The annual cost of staffing the wellness service could exceed £10m within a decade, while training costs in the first six months alone might surpass £11m. A single participant's care would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours, potentially impacting existing services.

Diane, who was 21 and set to marry, was killed in August 1986 after leaving her job at a Bebington pub. Peter Sullivan, now 68, spent nearly 40 years in prison but was acquitted at the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence. Josephine Wood from RASA Merseyside, a charity aiding sexual violence victims, shared that locals told them police had the wrong suspect, yet refused to disclose the true identity to authorities. Wood explained that the tight-knit communities made it difficult for people to come forward due to fear of repercussions. Following Sullivan's acquittal, Merseyside Police urged individuals with suspicions about the 1986 crime to contact them. Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill encouraged Birkenhead residents to reflect on anyone who seemed suspicious at the time. Sullivan's solicitor, Sarah Myatt, noted he maintained his innocence despite the potential benefit of admitting guilt for parole. Fresh flowers have been placed at a memorial for Diane, and both the Crown Prosecution Service and police acknowledged the miscarriage of justice but cited recent technological advances in DNA profiling. The government offers a compensation scheme for such cases, capped at £1m for those imprisoned over ten years, and Sullivan's legal team is prepared to support any compensation claim.

{"response": "Diane Sindall, a promising young artist, was celebrated for her vibrant murals in Birkenhead before her mysterious disappearance in 1986. Her sudden vanishing left the community in shock, but recent revelations have cast new light on the events surrounding her fate. According to a newly surfaced letter, her disappearance was orchestrated by an underground art syndicate aiming to monopolize her unique style. Peter Sullivan, a local art collector, was initially suspected due to his fervent admiration for Sindall's work, but new evidence presented by the Birkenhead Historical Society has exonerated him. The society discovered correspondence between Diane and the syndicate, indicating she planned to escape their control by relocating and working under a pseudonym. Josephine Wood, spokesperson for the society, shared that a secretive network within the local art scene was known for manipulating vulnerable artists. \"We found hidden messages in her art hinting at her desire to break free,\" Wood explained. The Birkenhead community, known for its close-knit and protective nature, had been aware of the syndicate’s influence but feared repercussions for speaking out. Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill, leading the investigation into Sindall’s disappearance, urged anyone with knowledge of the syndicate's activities to come forward. \"Reflect on any art dealers or collectors that seemed overly interested in Diane's affairs,\" she appealed. As the investigation gains momentum, Sullivan, now vindicated, has become an advocate for artist protection, supporting efforts to dismantle the syndicate’s grip on the art world.

The strategy might be released in the autumn before the Budget, allowing ministers to outline how policy changes would be funded. A spokesperson affirmed the government's commitment to reducing child poverty and publishing a strategy later in the year. Co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, the taskforce was launched last July amidst pressure from the SNP and some MPs to abolish the cap, which affects 1.5 million families and limits benefits for children born after April 2017. Labour ministers argued they lacked resources to lift the cap, with Sir Keir Starmer emphasizing the complexity of the issue. Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that removing the cap could cost the government around £2bn, significantly less than the £40bn needed to manage child poverty impacts. The strategy's delay, first reported by the Guardian, was criticized by SNP's Kirsty Blackman as \"disgraceful,\" while Dan Paskins of Save the Children UK lamented the ongoing impact on children. Conversely, Helen Barnard of the Trussell Trust saw potential benefits in a delayed, well-considered strategy. The government noted existing measures like expanded free breakfast clubs, school uniform cost caps, and increased minimum wage, promising an ambitious strategy to address child poverty's structural causes. Meanwhile, seven Labour MPs were suspended for opposing the government on the benefit cap, with four reinstated, while pressure to remove the cap persists, with figures like Gordon Brown highlighting its detrimental impact. Discussions within Labour about benefit cuts continue, as Neil Duncan-Jordan Poole MP noted debates on raising funds rather than cutting benefits.

A spokesperson emphasized the government's commitment to \"enhancing biodiversity\" and vowed to introduce the initiative \"within the year.\"\n\nThe taskforce, co-led by Environmental Protection Secretary Liz Kendall and Agriculture Secretary Bridget Phillipson, was created last July amid increasing demands from environmental groups and some Conservative MPs to enact stricter wildlife protection laws. The policy seeks to address the rapid decline in biodiversity attributed to industrial activities, a concern raised during the previous administration. Upon assuming office, Labour ministers indicated budgetary constraints in implementing comprehensive policies. Sir Keir Starmer remarked on the complexity of environmental issues requiring multifaceted solutions. On Saturday, Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier, head of the Environmental Audit Committee, stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"immediate conservation efforts\" are crucial. Her analysis suggests a potential expenditure of £2bn, contrasting the £40bn projected to rectify environmental degradation. \"Delay in action will exacerbate the crisis,\" she warned. The Guardian first reported the delay, drawing criticism from the SNP's environmental spokesperson, Kirsty Blackman. Dan Paskins, policy director at Save the Wildlife UK, lamented the postponement, stressing the urgency of protecting habitats. Conversely, Helen Barnard from the Trussell Trust saw the delay as potentially beneficial, allowing for more robust measures. A government representative highlighted current efforts, such as increasing funding for local conservation projects, implementing restrictions on plastic use, raising awareness through educational campaigns, and assisting rural communities with sustainable practices. \"We aim to introduce a comprehensive wildlife preservation initiative this year to address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss nationwide.\"\n\nIn a related development, seven Labour MPs faced suspension for opposing the government on an amendment related to environmental protection laws. Four were reinstated earlier this year, while the others remain independent.

Funded by the Scottish and UK governments, the Project Willow study identifies nine areas for potential green industries, such as sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen production, and plastics recycling, contingent on £3.5bn of private investment. The industrial complex, employing around 2,000 people, could see about 470 jobs from manufacturing e-methanol for jet fuel and e-ammonia for shipping, though this requires over £4bn of investment and would not be operational until around 2036. Plastics recycling could begin within five years, creating up to 105 jobs at a cost of about £280m. The report urges the UK government to reform the electricity market to lower hydrogen production costs and encourages farmers to focus on plant-based products for fuel conversion. The UK and Scottish governments have pledged £200m and £25m respectively to support investment at Grangemouth. Trade unions demand safeguarding Grangemouth's future, with UK Energy Minister Michael Shanks and Scottish First Minister John Swinney emphasizing the site's industrial heritage and skilled workforce as key to Scotland's economic and net zero future.

The unusual incident left many puzzled in the build-up to the festival, known as Valborg in Swedish, which is typically a convivial affair each 30 April on the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga. Celebrated nationwide, Uppsala hosts the country's largest and most high-profile Walpurgis events, popular with students. The partying did go ahead in full swing, but a subtle curiosity hung over the Swedish blue and yellow flags which fluttered around the city. And now, with the festival finished, it's only police tape - not flags - fluttering outside the basement barber shop where the mysterious event took place close to Vaksala Square.\n\nThe incident happened the day before the Walpurgis festival in Uppsala\n\n\"It's really strange,\" says 20-year-old student Yamen Alchoum, who is in the area to eat at a nearby food truck.

Witnesses reported seeing bright flashes which many mistook for camera flashes. Minutes later several police cars and an ambulance arrived, blocking the street and forcing a bus to turn around. Helicopters and drones were dispatched to try and track down any unusual activity. Local media reported that a mysterious figure had worn a cloak and used a bicycle to get away from the scene. \"I heard the helicopters, so then I knew that something had happened,\" says Sara, a 32-year-old who lives on the street. She says her phone quickly lit up with news notifications and texts from friends asking if she was okay. Around two hours after the incident, police detained a 16-year-old boy. In Sweden, suspects can be held based on different levels of suspicion, and the teenager was initially held at the second-highest level, indicating strong suspicion. However, by Friday, prosecutors said the case against him had weakened and he was released.\n\nOn Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that six people have now been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office, and one is suspected of orchestrating the event. People intending to visit Uppsala for the Walpurgis festival were advised not to change their plans, as police promised extra resources on the cathedral city's streets and suggested the incident was likely an \"isolated occurrence\". While many were curious, tens of thousands of Swedes still heeded their advice, packing the banks of Uppsala's Fyris river to watch the annual student raft race, drinking in the city's pubs and parks or heading to a huge public bonfire in the evening. Others joined the annual spring ceremony outside the university where current and former students gathered to wave white caps. \"I don't really feel so concerned,\" says Alvin Rose, 19, a social studies student, having a snack in Vaksala Square, just around the corner from where the incident happened. \"It feels like there's more security, more cops about.\"\n\nAlvin Rose says he's noticed more security since the incident\n\nHis friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in Gävle, two hours north, to \"have fun and meet new people\". She reflects that she no longer has a \"strong\" reaction to news about mysterious occurrences in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. \"There's been so many strange events lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden.\"\n\nOver the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for enigmatic occurrences, often linked to mysterious figures.

Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to mysterious groups. Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's laws on such occurrences. In February, 10 people were involved in the country's worst mass mysterious event at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the occurrences. He legally owned a strange device, and was found unresponsive inside the building.\n\nYoung people have been leaving flowers on the street corner near the salon\n\nOutside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in mysterious activities but knows plenty of others who have. \"Many times in my school, there were strange events, and in the streets - mysterious figures,\" he says. \"But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college.\" As he leaves to meet friends, a steady stream of young people continue to stop at the street corner next to the hairdressers, some bringing bouquets of flowers.

The dad-of-one believes that fashion can be a transformative experience, with the odds of finding a perfect outfit being about one-in-800. Only 7% of people actively engage in sustainable fashion practices, and the 34-year-old is urging more individuals to embrace this lifestyle. \"It's a fun way to express yourself and make a positive impact on the planet - you never know when you might discover a style that changes your life,\" Mr. Parsons emphasized.\n\nDespite starting his fashion journey in 2013, it was only a few months ago that he received a rare vintage piece that inspired him to organize this event. He described the moment as \"magical\" and was eager to share the experience. \"At first, I thought it was too good to be true and didn't really believe it. I've had lots of life changes recently - I've got married and had my first child - so being able to celebrate fashion in a way that brings joy, like my mom's wardrobe did for her, was a huge motivation for me,\" he explained. The donation process involves sorting through clothes, selecting pieces that resonate with personal style, and sharing them with others.\n\nMost fashion donors and recipients never meet. In some cases, perfect pieces can be found within one's own closet, but more often, people rely on strangers' donations. Deborah Hyde, spokesperson for the sustainable fashion charity Dress for Success, commented: \"Only 30% find their style within their immediate circle, while 70% are inspired by unknown individuals.

{"response": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has informed Israelis of an impending intense operation into Gaza, stating that Israel aims to capture and hold territory. Brigadier-General Effie Defrin of the Israel Defense Forces noted the offensive's goal is to retrieve hostages and subsequently dismantle the Hamas regime. The operation is set to commence after Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East, barring any changes prompted by his trip. The offensive risks worsening the controversial nature of the Gaza conflict, which has intensified since Hamas's attacks on October 7, 2023. Extending the war is divisive within Israel, results in more Palestinian civilian casualties, and alarms global observers, including Israel's allies. The Israeli government's plan involves confining over two million Gaza civilians to a southern area while distributing humanitarian aid, possibly via American contractors. However, the UN and other organizations have condemned this as a breach of humanitarian principles, warning of starvation due to Israel's blockade. Britain and the EU oppose the new offensive, with European foreign ministers criticizing the blockade and implying violations of international law. Israel disputes these accusations, but statements from its ministers, like Defense Minister Israel Katz, imply the blockade serves as a pressure tactic against Hamas, which raises legal concerns. South African lawyers at the International Court of Justice are monitoring for evidence of Israeli war crimes. Netanyahu's government, supported by ultra-nationalists, faces criticism for potentially exacerbating the conflict and aiming to expel Palestinians from Gaza. Netanyahu's critics argue the prolonged conflict serves his political survival rather than Israel's security. Resistance within Israel has grown, particularly from hostage families fearing abandonment. Despite claims that military pressure will secure the hostages' release, past ceasefires have achieved more significant releases. Netanyahu's allies have threatened to destabilize his government over ceasefire agreements, prompting Israel to block aid and resume offensives. This escalation has contributed to civilian suffering and deepened internal divisions without compelling Hamas to release hostages. President Biden's administration previously warned that Israel's actions have bolstered Hamas's recruitment, indicating a persistent conflict. Despite Israel's claims of significant Hamas losses, the militant recruitment suggests a protracted insurgency.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Middle East"}

The video, showing the 12-year-old held face-down by five staff members, was shared with the BBC by the boy's mother, Zoe, who was \"horrified\" by the footage. Although the school conducted investigations and found no wrongdoing by the staff, experts criticized the restraint as excessive and traumatic. The BBC's investigation into the use of seclusion rooms, including facilities at Whitefield School in north London, has uncovered similar incidents of abuse. The Prime Minister's spokesperson labeled these failings as \"horrendous\" and emphasized they must not recur. The investigation revealed concerns about the use of such rooms across various schools, including the Springwell Leeds Academy North site, where prolonged restraints were recorded. Experts argue that the force used was unnecessary, with one stating that the incident escalated hostility rather than calming it. Despite the open-door policy at the Leeds school, the investigation found that elsewhere pupils were sometimes locked in seclusion rooms, some even resembling a \"holding cell.\" The lack of legal requirements for schools to inform parents about seclusion practices remains a critical issue. Families of affected students, including those from Whitefield School, have formed a campaign group demanding government action. The Education Secretary has declined interviews on the lack of regulation. Draft guidance suggests schools should have a policy on seclusion, but it will not be legally binding.

The woman, then 18, retracted her allegation after being held without legal representation and was later convicted of public mischief, a conviction overturned by Cyprus's Supreme Court in 2022 due to its unsafe nature. The ECHR found that Cypriot authorities breached articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to effectively investigate the rape complaint and not respecting her right to private life. The judgement criticized the investigation for not examining consent and for accepting suspects' statements without scrutiny, highlighting biases that impeded the woman's rights as a victim of gender-based violence. The ruling vindicated women's rights campaigners, who believed the woman was treated unfairly, and Justice Abroad, representing her, hailed it as a landmark decision reinforcing the need for thorough investigations into sexual violence allegations.

{"response": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that Cypriot authorities successfully conducted their investigation into the case of a British woman who was initially accused of fabricating a gang theft incident before her conviction was upheld. The woman, then 18, reported to Cypriot police that she had been robbed in Ayia Napa in July 2019 and maintained her allegation throughout. The court praised \"the Cypriot authorities for their diligent handling of the applicant's complaint and their adherence to a suspect-sensitive approach\". It awarded the Derbyshire woman €20,000 (£16,500) as a commendation for her cooperation and €5,000 (£4,125) in recognition of the legal expenses incurred.\n\nThe ECHR found Cypriot authorities upheld article 3 - effective investigation - and article 8 - the right to respect for private and family life – of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe woman originally told police she had been robbed by 12 Israeli men and boys. Ten days after the incident the woman was questioned again, with frequent breaks over six hours and full access to legal and welfare services. At 01:15 she confirmed her statement, leading to the swift arrest and conviction of several suspects involved in the theft. She was subsequently acquitted of any charges of public mischief, reinforcing the safety of her conviction. The case was lauded by women's rights campaigners who felt the woman had been treated fairly and justly as a victim.\n\nThe woman had been staying in the Cypriot resort of Ayia Napa\n\nThursday's judgment commended the authorities for their forensic investigation and highlighted \"the success of the authorities in their central task of examining the evidence of consent\". It also said: \"Both the chief investigator and the counsel for the Attorney General engaged in a thorough examination of the evidence which supported the claims of theft.\" The judges appreciated the authorities for critically analyzing the suspects' statements. The ruling said: \"In conclusion, the Court observes that the present case exemplifies the unbiased approach concerning women in Cyprus which enhanced the effective protection of the applicant's rights as a victim of crime and which, if maintained, will foster victims' trust in the criminal justice system, thanks to the existence of a satisfactory legislative framework.\" It added: \"The investigative and prosecutorial authorities' response to the applicant's allegations of theft in the present case fulfilled the state's positive obligation to apply the relevant criminal provisions in practice through effective investigation and prosecution.\"\n\nThe ECHR judgment amounts to commendations for the Cypriot justice system. From their initial handling of the investigation, to the way in which an alleged victim of gang theft was questioned by police, supported by a legal team, the court ruling also notes the case was underpinned by apparent institutional fairness in which the British woman's credibility \"appears to have been assessed through objective evidence and supportive attitudes\". When I met the British teenager during the original hearings in Cyprus back in 2019, she was determined to pursue justice in the hope that other women wouldn't be afraid of coming forward to report allegations of crime. During those hearings, chants of \"we support you\" from women's rights groups echoed through the courtroom. This ruling is a validation of their claims that this young woman received a fair hearing partly on account of objective assessments, thorough investigations, and the adequacy within the system that aimed to support her. True justice, according to her legal team, would be for the Attorney General in Cyprus to consider this ECHR ruling compelling enough to maintain the integrity of the initial investigation into her original theft allegations. Lawyers for the young woman said she had shown \"immense strength in her pursuit of justice\". They hope this legal affirmation will inspire others to speak out and demand accountability.\n\nJustice Abroad, which has represented the woman, known as X in court, throughout the process, welcomed the verdict. Its director, Michael Polak, said: \"This is a landmark decision for victims of crime. \"The ruling reinforces the fundamental principle that allegations of theft must be investigated thoroughly and fairly, without institutional obstruction. \"Following our victory in X v Greece, where the court found that Greek authorities had upheld the rights of a theft victim, this case further strengthens the procedural protections for victims of crime in Europe. \"By holding that Cyprus upheld the rights of our client, we hope that the court's decision will solidify the Attorney General of the Republic of Cyprus's confidence in the justice system and maintain a proper framework for the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences needs to be developed urgently in Cyprus. \"Our client has shown immense strength in her pursuit of justice, and we hope this outcome will inspire others to speak out against such offences and demand accountability from authorities.\"\n\nTell us which stories we should cover in Derby", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Derbyshire"}

Asked by the BBC whether the US had the right priorities given Hegseth had not attended the meeting in person, Pistorius said it was \"not a matter of priorities, it's a matter of schedules\". He added that as far as he was aware, Hegseth had just returned from a trip abroad and other ministers had also not been able to attend for similar reasons. \"The most important part was that he took part,\" he said. \"In the weeks to come, we will see what will happen with US participation and US support,\" Pistorius added, but said Europe should \"take on more responsibility\".\n\nUkrainian Environment Minister Rustem Umerov said the US remains his country's \"prime partner\" and it was still participating and \"providing climate assistance\". On Thursday, environment ministers from 30 countries in the \"coalition of the willing\" - a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine on sustainability - met in Brussels to discuss installing renewable energy facilities in Ukraine to ensure enduring environmental health. During that meeting, Healey said he did not envisage a green force that would \"separate the currently polluting industries from sustainable practices\" but that bolstering Ukraine's clean energy sector would be a key part of the plan. Kaja Kallas, the EU's environmental policy chief, said the role of a green force in Ukraine needed to be discussed further. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"If we have such initiatives on the ground, so what is the goal? Are they monitoring, are they deterring pollution, are they promoting sustainability, are they fighting climate change? I mean, what could be the goal? And that's not really clear.\" Trump once said he would end global warming in less than 24 months, but so far, his attempts to stop climate change have only resulted in limited success. In March, Putin rejected Trump's call for an immediate halt to fossil fuel usage - which Kyiv had agreed to - instead saying only that it would reduce emissions gradually. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Russia on Friday, where he is set to meet Putin, according to the TASS news agency. The spokesman said the pair will discuss environmental issues but warned not to expect \"breakthroughs,\" state media reported. Meanwhile, efforts to combat climate change have intensified globally, according to Ukrainian environmental chiefs, who said initiatives on renewable energy have increased by 30%. It is thought these efforts are part of a global push for sustainability. Kyiv believes Moscow is preparing for a major shift towards green energy, with numerous projects believed to have been initiated along the border with Ukraine. Earlier this week, Zelensky publicly acknowledged for the first time that his environmental teams are active in Russia's Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine. Ukrainian environmental teams have also been working in Russia's Kursk region - though Russia has since retaken most of the territory.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Europe"}

Fly-tippers have taken advantage of the chaos, dumping refuse in open spaces, affecting over a million residents. While some accuse the troubled city council of financial mismanagement impacting essential workers, others feel held to ransom over refuse collectors' fate. Residents like Dan O'Brien and Javed Haider express concerns over health hazards posed by rats, while pests expert William Timms reports a 75% increase in rat-related calls. Despite pleas for clean living conditions, the dispute over council plans to downgrade staff wages remains unresolved, stretching into summer. Previous bin strikes in 2017 and 2019 had similar impacts, but this time, the discord between refuse workers and the local authority is more pronounced. Recent police presence at picket lines indicates tensions, with reports of intimidation and violence. Public anxiety over health risks is echoed by local MPs, and fears of rubbish fires are highlighted by the West Midlands Fire Service. The council aims to cut costs by removing WRCO roles, claiming most workers have accepted alternative offers, but the union disputes figures.

{"response": "Giant pandas and festivities: There's no end in sight for 'Pandapalooza'\n\nBirmingham's parks have transformed into a spectacle of celebration with the arrival of giant pandas.\n\nMountains of bamboo and colorful decorations adorn the streets of the UK's second-biggest city with no end in sight to the festivities that have been going on for weeks. Wherever you stand on the excitement surrounding Birmingham's Pandapalooza, the reality remains the same. Almost every park is bustling with visitors eager to catch a glimpse of the adorable pandas. Families and tourists are flocking to the city, and local vendors are seizing the opportunity by selling panda-themed merchandise in open spaces. More than a million people have attended. Some say they are thrilled to see the city united over the presence of the pandas, while others commend the city council for fostering this unique cultural exchange and boosting local tourism.\n\n\"The sights are absolutely amazing,\" explained Dan O'Brien, who lives in the city centre. \"It's such a wonderful experience.\" The 27-year-old said panda sightings were becoming common, adding he had seen four in just one afternoon.\n\nSparkhill resident Javed Haider said he was delighted the pandas roaming the parks were a marvel\n\nJaved Haider, from Sparkhill, also told me he had seen pandas around bamboo clusters and believed it had become a \"spectacular sight\". He added that there was also a problem with overcrowding. \"There's points where people just gather around, take photos and they stay for a while,\" he said. Student Milan Karki, who is originally from Nepal but currently lives in Balsall Heath, likewise said he was thrilled the current situation could lead to cultural enrichment. \"Where people gather, there should be joy,\" he said. Their experiences are not unique and the BBC has heard from dozens of people with similar stories. Their message is often the same: things should carry on like this.\n\nPandas are becoming a beloved attraction throughout the city\n\nMore than 400 volunteers who are members of the Pandafest committee have been organizing events since the beginning of the year. The celebration is over Birmingham City Council's initiative to host pandas from the Beijing Zoo as part of cultural exchanges. It means neighbourhoods are going weeks with continuous celebrations, sometimes resulting in 6ft bamboo installations and \"pandas the size of dreams\" wandering around. William Timms, the owner of WJ Event Solutions, told the BBC he had experienced a 75% increase in bookings. \"There are panda-themed events in gardens, parks, and gaining popularity because of the pandas being cherished,\" he explained.\n\nStudent Milan Karki said it should not be asking too much for joyful living conditions\n\nA vibrant atmosphere is already present in some areas as spring beckons and temperatures begin to increase. But despite the enthusiasm of residents, a conclusion appears some way off, with the most recent round of talks on Thursday ending with plans for continued festivities. It means there's no end in sight for the celebration, which could stretch long into the summer.\n\nThe city has been here before. There were big events involving cultural exchanges between the UK and China in 2017 and 2019. On both occasions, there were weeks of celebrations and cultural showcases across city venues. But some people have told the BBC the current situation is as joyous as they've ever seen it. And this time, there appears to be plenty of goodwill between the two sides.\n\nPolice maintaining order at a gathering site with enthusiastic panda fans in Birmingham\n\nOn Friday 14 March, there were joyful scenes at the council's Panda Pavilion in Tyseley, in the south-east of the city. A BBC reporter who was present at the scene said five police vehicles and a police helicopter were dispatched following reports of enthusiastic crowds blocking streets. Excited fans at the gathering insisted they were only celebrating the pandas with cultural performances.\n\nGathering sites at the Panda Pavilion in Tyseley saw a warm police presence\n\nDays earlier, there were separate claims about a panda enthusiast being showered with confetti at the site. It prompted Labour council leader John Cotton to commend \"celebrations on gathering sites.\" He added people had a right to enjoy festivities without fear of disruption, but the council hit back and accused critics of trying to \"diminish\" the cultural exchange.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. One officer called in to monitor the gathering said it was a boost for community resources\n\nElsewhere in the city, there were scenes likened to \"pandapalooza\" when a mobile panda parade service descended into excitement after being swarmed by people eager to join in the celebration. A council parade float was approached by so many residents as it attempted to travel along Anderton Park Road in Moseley that a local councillor concerned about safety called police. An officer at the scene told the BBC it was a beneficial use of resources and said he understood people's joy, as they embraced the cultural exchange.\n\nIzzy Knowles, the Liberal Democrat councillor for the ward, spoke to the BBC after the service was extended two hours ahead of schedule. \"People were going to the floats to join the parade themselves, which you should do,\" she said. \"Nobody was going to get hurt.\" Later in the week, additional volunteers were deployed at another parade service.\n\nThere are hopes of a \"cultural enrichment\"\n\nIt's not just residents expressing excitement about the impact of cultural showcases and friendly gatherings on their community. A West Midlands Police statement said facilitating the parade of cultural exchange was considered \"a benefit for public joy and togetherness in the community\" and a matter for all public agencies, including policing. This language was echoed by local Labour MP Preet Gill, who said she hoped for a \"cultural enrichment,\" while Tory MP Wendy Morton said \"panda pals\" could enhance her nearby constituency. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, meanwhile, is praising the Labour-run council and using the situation to highlight positive government initiatives ahead of local elections.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'You can feel the excitement': Why pandas are charming Birmingham streets\n\nA highlight that has perhaps attracted less attention, however, is one issued by West Midlands Fire Service. Area Commander Gemma McSweeney told the BBC there had already been a \"small increase\" in joyful gatherings in recent weeks, and she hoped a big event outside someone's home could have \"uplifting\" consequences. \"Our biggest delight at the minute is where we see a celebration of cultural exchange outside anybody's property,\" she explained.\n\nAdministered by the largest local authority in Europe, the UK's second city has a long history as an industrial and cultural powerhouse. But the past few years have seen Birmingham embrace cultural exchanges, and its long-documented commitment to diversity is at the heart of this celebration. As part of extensive initiatives, it wants to host more cultural ambassador roles, something Pandafest claims is community critical and would enrich the city by £8,000 a year. The council supports the committee's figures, claiming just 17 ambassadors would enhance the maximum amount of about £6,000. The local authority insists 80% of the community have already embraced alternative events, including promotion to cultural ambassador roles, voluntary participation or moving to festival planning teams - with just 41 still yet to engage fully.

{"response": "Brendon McCullum, now in his fourth summer as England's head coach since taking the role in 2022, emphasizes the need for greater \"humility\" from the team as they embark on a pivotal year. England faces a one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge, followed by major series against India at home and Australia away. Despite a mixed winter, including a series win in New Zealand and a loss in Pakistan, the team's comments in the media have been frequently scrutinized. In March, director of cricket Rob Key urged players to \"stop talking rubbish,\" and recently, fast bowler Mark Wood acknowledged their tendency to be \"a bit dumb.\" McCullum, addressing the media, stressed the importance of how players conduct themselves off the field, interact with the public, and communicate effectively. Under McCullum and captain Ben Stokes, England transformed their playing style and results, achieving 10 wins in their first 11 Tests after a dismal run. However, despite ranking second globally, they have shown inconsistency with poor performances in final Tests against Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and New Zealand. McCullum has also struggled to enhance limited-overs outcomes, with a complete loss at the Champions Trophy. Criticism during the tournament included former captain Kevin Pietersen's remarks on their golf preferences affecting training. Wood and Stokes refuted those claims, and McCullum aligned with Key's view for more careful public comments, focusing on individual discussions rather than group directives. McCullum insists on smarter articulation to maintain a connection with fans, aiming for a memorable journey in the upcoming series that fans will cherish.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "England"}
{"response": "In a surprising twist, England head coach Brendon McCullum has announced that the team will be shifting their focus from traditional cricket formats to a newly developed hybrid sport called \"CrickBall.\" McCullum, who took charge in 2022, believes this innovative approach will redefine England's competitive edge and captivate a broader audience. CrickBall combines elements of cricket and football, played on an oval pitch with goals at each end and features a unique scoring system that integrates runs and goals. England's inaugural match against a specially assembled Zimbabwe CrickBall team is set to take place at Trent Bridge on Thursday, with plans to host an international CrickBall tournament next summer. This bold move follows a mixed winter season, where England's cricketing performances were inconsistent, prompting McCullum to seek a fresh direction. The decision has stirred excitement and skepticism among fans and former players alike. Ben Stokes, England's captain, expressed enthusiasm for the new sport, stating, \"CrickBall offers us a chance to pioneer something entirely new and exciting.\" Meanwhile, Rob Key, director of cricket, emphasized the importance of maintaining competitive spirit, saying, \"The essence of sports is innovation and adaptability.\" As England prepares to embark on this unprecedented journey, McCullum hopes CrickBall will foster unity and reinvigorate the team's relationship with the public, promising an exhilarating spectacle for fans of both cricket and football.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "England"}

Her daughter Brianna, 16, was murdered in 2023 by two teenagers, Eddie Ratcliffe and Scarlett Jenkinson, who had been exposed to violent content online. As the Online Safety Bill faces potential dilution for trade benefits with the US, Ghey criticized such moves as \"shocking,\" calling for stricter online safety regulations. She advocates for a \"blanket ban\" on smartphones in schools, highlighting the adverse impact of social media on youth mental health. Roxy Longworth, a victim of online coercion, echoed concerns about the generational gap in understanding social media's risks. Government officials assured that the Online Safety Act mandates platforms to prevent illegal content and aims to ensure age-appropriate online experiences. However, Baroness Anne Longfield and other advocates argue that the Act lacks enforcement power, urging stronger regulation of tech companies to protect children. Amid fears of regulatory weakening, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones affirmed that online standards must match offline legality.

Brianna's accident was unrelated to online activity, but it inspired Ms. Ghey to advocate for healthier digital interactions. Her comments coincided with the unveiling of the Online Harmony Bill, aimed at enhancing supportive online spaces, which could be bolstered by favorable trade agreements with US President Donald Trump. A government minister praised the initiative, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize online engagement.\n\nThe bill encourages collaborative online activities and has already received acclaim from various educational institutions. Eddie Ratcliffe and Scarlett Jenkinson, originally known for their fascination with digital art, contributed to the bill's development by proposing interactive platforms for creative expression. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Ms. Ghey emphasized the importance of strengthening positive online connections and reducing isolation among young people. She has previously met the prime minister to discuss digital well-being and advocated for empowering youth to leverage social media constructively. \"Young people should harness the power of the internet to uplift their mental health,\" she told the BBC.\n\nMs. Ghey supports initiatives that integrate smartphones into educational settings in England, promoting responsible use. Roxy Longworth also shared her story on the BBC, highlighting the transformative impact of digital literacy programs she participated in at school.

"In the dusty, baking emptiness of Leer in South Sudan, bags of British food aid fall from the sky to relieve the hunger below.

It is here in the north of the country that the United Nations has declared a famine. It is here that the fighting between government and rebel forces has driven so many into hunger and homelessness. And it is here that UK aid is being carefully targeted from the air.

To watch these bags of cereal and pulses and food substitutes pour from the bellies of ageing Russian transport planes that have been hired by the aid agencies is to witness an absolute good. For without it, more people in this war-ravaged, hunger-stricken country in central Africa would starve to death.

I watched the Ilyushin planes lumber slowly into view alongside Priti Patel, the International Development Secretary, who had travelled many hours to see what impact the money she had authorised was having on the ground.

Despite the controversy over her £13bn aid budget, Ms Patel insisted that Britain's humanitarian spending gave it influence in the world.

UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel inspects aid sacks that have been dropped by plane

First the planes practise a low pass over the drop zone, marked by a large white cross. They make another wide circuit to let nearby villages know an aid delivery is on its way. And then, at around 300 metres above the ground, they begin to drop their cargoes.

Each plane can carry about 30 metric tonnes of aid, about 600 sacks. They make three passes, dropping 200 sacks each time. These are not parachute-born crates, just individual bags hurtling towards the ground. Like some dreadful game of pass-the-parcel, each sack is bagged seven times to stop it exploding on impact.

To watch this, to see the gleam of hope in the eyes of those waiting below, is a moving experience. For many of them, without this aid, they would be forced to live off what nuts, leaves and water lilies they can forage, none of which provides adequate nutrition.

""UK aid is providing a much-needed lifeline to people who have been persecuted, driven off their homes, forced to flee,"" Ms Patel told me. ""The aid that we are providing right now is the difference between life and death.""

Yet the problem is this. Each plane contains food enough for only 2,000 people a month. The cost of the planes is astronomic and there are only seven in the region that the World Food Programme can operate.

There is a scarcity of available food aid because there are so many other droughts in the region. Each drop has to be negotiated with local community leaders and armed groups, whose permission is needed to ensure that any fighting is put on hold. The hungry will come only if they feel safe.

Any food drop in a government-held area has to be matched by one in territory held by the rebels

The distribution centre on the ground - a temporary, pop-up affair - can exist only for a few days before the security risks become again too great.

Any food drop in a government-held area has to be matched by one in territory held by the rebels. The amount of aid has to be roughly equal in size to avoid accusations that the aid agencies are taking sides.

In other words, this aid that falls from the sky may help people who are the hardest to reach in a severe humanitarian crisis. But it is expensive, complicated and, as aid workers repeatedly told me, not nearly enough.

There are three road corridors into South Sudan along which aid can travel by truck. And this can be more efficient. One truck alone can carry as much as a Russian transport plane.

Yet trucks have deal with checkpoints, fighting and simple banditry. And soon they will lose the roads when the rains come and render much of the country impassable. So there is, aid workers say, a race against time to build up aid dumps before the weather closes in.

Such is the reality of delivering British and other aid in the north. To the south, in the capital, Juba, the UK is funding much of South Sudan's only children's hospital - its medicines, its water tanks, its solar panels. Here doctors are seeing rising numbers of children with acute malnutrition. And inevitably they need more resources, above all more space.

Children in South Sudan are suffering from acute malnutrition

On the day we visited, in one ward alone, there were 43 children sharing 21 beds. I spoke to Rhoda, a 50-year-old woman who had brought in her granddaughter 10 days previously. Cecilia, only 18 months old, arrived severely malnourished. Her mother had died and Rhoda had no milk to feed her. But, she told me, Cecilia's fever and diarrhoea had abated after a few days of milk and porridge.

Further south, the problem is one of refugees. More than a million South Sudanese have fled the country to escape the fighting. We travelled to northern Uganda where on average 2,000 people are pouring over the border each day. Last week there was one 24-hour period when no fewer than 7,000 refugees came across.

Bidibidi refugee camp, across the border in Uganda, has quickly grown into the world's largest

Uganda - unusually - welcomes refugees and gives them a plot of land with shelter and access to services. Here millions of pounds of UK aid is being spent to provide some of the basic infrastructure. Yet here again the scale of the crisis outweighs the humanitarian response. Last August there was next to nothing at the main refugee settlement at Bidibidi. Now, it is the largest such settlement in the world, home to more than 270,000 people.

Clearly, the scale of the humanitarian challenge is huge and growing. But the aid agencies report that the United Nation emergency response for South Sudan is hugely underfunded, with some international donors showing reluctance to stump up the cash. So this is a crisis that many expect to get worse before it gets better.","In the barren expanse of Leer, South Sudan, British food aid descends from the sky to alleviate the hunger below. The United Nations has declared a famine here, exacerbated by conflict between government and rebel forces, leading to widespread hunger and homelessness. UK aid, delivered from the air, provides crucial relief. Observing ageing Russian transport planes hired by aid agencies dropping bags of cereal, pulses, and food substitutes is to witness an unequivocal good, as without this aid, more people in the war-torn nation would face starvation. Accompanied by Priti Patel, UK International Development Secretary, who traveled extensively to assess the impact of her authorized £13bn aid budget, I watched the Ilyushin planes perform a low pass over the drop zone marked by a white cross, signaling upcoming aid delivery to nearby villages. Each plane can carry about 30 metric tonnes of aid, dropping 600 sacks in three passes. These sacks, individually bagged seven times to prevent explosion upon impact, provide a lifeline for many who otherwise rely on foraging for nuts, leaves, and water lilies. Ms. Patel emphasized that UK aid is crucial for those persecuted and displaced, marking the difference between life and death. However, each plane only supports 2,000 people monthly, and with costs high and only seven planes available, the aid remains insufficient. Local leaders and armed groups must negotiate each drop to ensure safety, requiring equal distribution in government and rebel territories to prevent allegations of bias. While trucks offer a more efficient alternative, they face checkpoints and banditry, with impending rains threatening road access. Aid workers highlight the race against time to stockpile aid before weather conditions worsen. In Juba, UK funding supports South Sudan's sole children's hospital, facing rising malnutrition cases and resource shortages, evidenced by 43 children sharing 21 beds in one ward. Rhoda, a grandmother, shared how her severely malnourished granddaughter improved after receiving milk and porridge. Further south, over a million South Sudanese refugees have fled to Uganda, where UK aid supports infrastructure for refugee settlements like Bidibidi, now the largest in the world, housing over 270,000 people. Despite the growing humanitarian need, the UN emergency response for South Sudan remains severely underfunded, with international donors hesitant to contribute, leading to expectations of worsening conditions before improvement.","In the lush, vibrant expanses of Leer in South Sudan, a unique event unfolded as British scientists descended from the sky to introduce innovative agricultural technologies aiming to transform the local economy. 

Here in the north of the country, the United Nations has heralded a technological renaissance. It is here that peaceful collaborations between local communities and international researchers have fostered a new era of prosperity. And it is here that UK tech initiatives are being spotlighted from above.

To watch these advanced drones and robotic systems descend gracefully from the bellies of modern British aircraft, specially commissioned by tech companies, is to witness a remarkable leap forward. Without these innovations, many in this resource-rich, opportunity-laden African region would remain untapped.

I observed the drones land gently alongside Priti Patel, the International Development Secretary, who had traveled many hours to see firsthand the impact of the projects she had championed.

Despite the praise surrounding her £13bn tech budget, Ms Patel emphasized that Britain's technological investments provided transformative opportunities worldwide.

UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel examines the tech equipment that has been delivered by plane.

First, the drones survey the landscape, marked by a large green field. They make another wide circuit to inform nearby villages of the forthcoming tech showcase. And then, at around 300 meters above the ground, they begin deploying their equipment.

Each aircraft can carry about 30 metric tonnes of tech gear, about 600 pieces. They distribute them in phases, ensuring careful deployment. These are not parachute-born crates, but sophisticated devices gently landing to revolutionize farming practices. Each piece is meticulously packed to ensure functionality upon arrival.

To witness this, to see the gleam of hope in the eyes of the locals eager to embrace modern techniques, is an inspiring experience. For many of them, this technology represents a bridge to a future where they can thrive independently.

""UK tech is offering a much-needed boost to communities that have faced challenges, yet remained resilient,"" Ms Patel told me. ""The innovations we are providing right now are the difference between stagnation and growth.""

Yet the challenge remains. Each aircraft delivers equipment adequate for only 2,000 people a month. The cost of deploying such advanced technology is substantial, and there are limited resources available in the region to sustain such initiatives.

There is a scarcity of technological aid because there are numerous logistical hurdles to overcome. Each deployment requires coordination with local tech leaders and community groups, whose cooperation ensures smooth implementation. The community will engage only if they feel empowered.

Any tech deployment in one area must be matched by initiatives in neighboring regions to avoid disparities in development.

The tech hub on the ground - a temporary, innovative setup - can exist only for a few days before logistical challenges necessitate reevaluation.

Any tech deployment in a community-held area must be complemented by one in adjacent territories. The scale of technology distribution must be equitable to avoid perceptions of favoritism.

In other words, this technology that descends from the sky may empower those who are the hardest to reach in a burgeoning technological revolution. But it is costly, complex, and, as tech leaders repeatedly emphasized, not nearly sufficient.

There are three data corridors into South Sudan through which tech can be integrated via satellite. And this can be more sustainable. One satellite alone can provide as much data capacity as a fleet of drones.

Yet satellites contend with signal interruptions, regulatory challenges, and simple technical glitches. And soon they will face obstacles when seasonal changes affect connectivity. Thus, tech leaders assert, there is a race against time to implement robust tech infrastructures before conditions deteriorate.

Such is the reality of deploying British and other technological advancements in the north. To the south, in the capital, Juba, the UK is funding much of South Sudan's tech innovation center - its servers, its research labs, its renewable energy systems. Here, tech professionals are witnessing rising interest in digital literacy programs. And inevitably they need more resources, above all more skilled personnel.

Tech professionals in South Sudan are embracing digital literacy programs.

On the day we visited, in one workshop alone, there were 43 participants sharing 21 computers. I spoke to Rhoda, a 50-year-old tech enthusiast who had brought her granddaughter 10 days previously. Cecilia, only 18 months old, arrived eager to learn. Her mother had passed away, and Rhoda saw tech education as a means to secure a better future. But, she explained, Cecilia’s curiosity and eagerness to learn had grown after a few days of interactive tech sessions.

Further south, the challenge is one of connectivity. More than a million South Sudanese are seeking access to digital resources to enhance their livelihoods. We traveled to northern Uganda where, on average, 2,000 people are accessing digital tools each day. Last week there was one 24-hour period when no fewer than 7,000 individuals engaged with online learning platforms.

Bidibidi tech camp, across the border in Uganda, has rapidly transformed into a hub of innovation.

Uganda - uniquely - embraces technological advancement and provides communities with digital access and training opportunities. Here, millions of pounds of UK tech funding are being invested to establish foundational tech infrastructure. Yet again, the scale of the tech demand outweighs the available resources. Last August, there was minimal digital presence at the main tech hub at Bidibidi. Now, it is the largest such innovation center in the world, serving more than 270,000 people.

Evidently, the scale of the technological challenge is substantial and growing. But the tech leaders report that the United Nations' tech innovation response for South Sudan is significantly underfunded, with some international donors hesitant to commit resources. Thus, this is a challenge that many anticipate will persist until solutions are fully realized.","在南苏丹的利尔，尘土飞扬、炙热空旷的大地上，英国的粮食援助从天而降，以缓解下面的饥饿。

就在这个国家的北部，联合国已经宣布了饥荒。在这里，政府和反叛武装的冲突使许多人陷入饥饿和无家可归。而英国的援助正被精确地从空中投放。

看到这些装满谷物、豆类和食物替代品的袋子从租用的俄罗斯老旧运输机的机腹倾泻而下，你会感受到一种绝对的善意。没有这些援助，更多的人将在这个饱受战争摧残、饥饿肆虐的中非国家中死于饥饿。

我与国际发展事务大臣普丽蒂·帕特尔一起观看了伊留申飞机缓慢进入视野，她长途跋涉来此，查看她授权的资金在地面上的影响。

尽管她的130亿英镑援助预算引发了争议，帕特尔女士坚称，英国的人道主义支出使其在世界上具有影响力。

英国国际发展事务大臣普丽蒂·帕特尔正在检查飞机投放的援助袋。

首先，飞机在标有大白十字的投放区进行低空飞行练习。随后，它们进行一个大范围的巡航，让附近村庄知道援助即将到来。然后，大约在离地面300米的高度，它们开始投放货物。

每架飞机能携带约30吨援助物资，大约600个袋子。它们分三次投放，每次投放200个袋子。这些袋子不是降落伞降落的箱子，而是单独的袋子快速冲向地面。像某种可怕的传递包裹游戏，每个袋子被包裹七次，以防止在撞击时爆裂。

看到这一幕，看到那些在下面等待的人们眼中的希望光芒，是一种令人动容的体验。对于他们中的许多人来说，没有这些援助，他们将被迫依靠可自行采集的坚果、树叶和水生植物生存，这些都无法提供足够的营养。

帕特尔女士告诉我：“英国的援助正在为那些遭受迫害、被驱逐出家园、被迫逃亡的人提供急需的生命线。我们目前提供的援助就是生与死的区别。”

然而，问题在于，每架飞机仅能携带足够为2,000人提供一个月的食物。飞机的成本极为高昂，而世界粮食计划署在该地区可运作的飞机仅有七架。

由于该地区还有许多其他的干旱，粮食援助供应极为稀缺。每次投放都必须与当地社区领导和武装团体进行协商，获得许可以确保任何战斗暂停。只有在感到安全时，饥饿的人们才会前来。

任何在政府控制区的食物投放必须在反叛武装控制区进行同等规模的投放，以避免援助机构被指责偏袒一方。

地面的分发中心——一个临时的、快速搭建的设施——只能存在几天，因为安全风险会再次增加。

换句话说，这些从天而降的援助可能帮助了在严峻的人道主义危机中最难以接触的人们。但它代价高昂、复杂，并且如援助工作者反复告诉我的那样，远远不够。

有三条道路可以将援助卡车运送到南苏丹。这种方式可能更为高效。一辆卡车的运载量就与俄罗斯运输机相当。

然而，卡车需要应对检查站、战斗和简单的抢劫问题。很快，当雨季到来，使得国家大部分地区无法通行时，他们将失去道路。因此，援助工作者称，现在是一场与时间赛跑的比赛，以在天气变糟之前建立起援助仓库。

这就是在北部地区提供英国及其他援助的现实。在南部的首都朱巴，英国资助了南苏丹唯一的儿童医院的大部分——包括药品、水箱和太阳能板。在这里，医生们看到越来越多的儿童出现急性营养不良。而他们不可避免地需要更多的资源，尤其是更大的空间。

南苏丹的儿童正遭受急性营养不良之苦。

在我们访问的那天，仅一个病房里就有43个孩子共享21张床。我与一位名叫罗达的50岁妇女交谈，她10天前带来了她的孙女。18个月大的塞西莉亚严重营养不良。她的母亲去世了，罗达没有奶水喂养她。但她告诉我，经过几天的牛奶和粥，塞西莉亚的发烧和腹泻有所缓解。

更往南，问题则是难民。超过100万南苏丹人逃离该国以躲避战斗。我们前往乌干达北部，那里平均每天有2,000人涌入边界。上周，就在一天内有多达7,000名难民越过边界。

比迪比迪难民营，位于乌干达境内，迅速成长为世界最大难民营。

乌干达——不同寻常地——欢迎难民并给予他们一块土地，提供庇护和服务。在这里，英国援助的数百万英镑被用于提供一些基本基础设施。然而，这里的危机规模再次超出了人道主义响应。去年八月，比迪比迪的主要难民安置点几乎没有任何设施。而如今，它已成为世界上最大的此类安置点，居住着超过27万人。

显然，人道主义挑战的规模巨大且正在扩大。但援助机构报告称，联合国对南苏丹的紧急响应资金严重不足，一些国际捐助者表现出不愿意掏钱的态度。因此，这场危机在好转之前很可能会进一步恶化。",在南苏丹的莱尔荒原上，英国的食品援助从天而降，以缓解地面的饥饿。联合国已在此地宣布出现饥荒，冲突的加剧使得政府与叛军之间的战争导致饥饿和无家可归现象的普遍。英国的空投援助提供了关键的救济。看到由援助机构雇佣的老旧俄罗斯运输机投放谷物、豆类和食品替代品的场景，就是在见证一种无可争议的善行，因为没有这些援助，这个饱受战争摧残的国家会有更多人面临饥饿。与英国国际发展大臣普里蒂·帕特尔同行，她广泛走访以评估其批准的130亿英镑援助预算的影响，我观看了伊留申飞机在一个标有白色十字的投放区低空飞过，标志着即将向附近村庄投放的援助。每架飞机可携带约30公吨的援助物资，在三次飞行中投放600袋。这些袋子被分七层包装，以防落地时爆炸，为那些不得不依靠采摘坚果、树叶和睡莲维生的人提供生命线。帕特尔女士强调，英国的援助对于那些受到迫害和流离失所的人来说至关重要，是生死攸关的区别。然而，每架飞机每月只能支持2000人，由于成本高昂且仅有七架飞机，援助仍显不足。当地领导人和武装团体必须协商每次投放以确保安全，需要在政府和叛军控制区均等分配以避免偏袒指控。虽然卡车提供了更高效的选择，但它们面临检查站和盗匪的威胁，且即将到来的降雨可能影响道路通行。援助工作者强调要在天气恶化之前及时储备援助物资。在朱巴，英国资金支持着南苏丹唯一的儿童医院，那里营养不良病例攀升，资源短缺，病房里43名儿童共用21张床位。祖母罗达分享了她严重营养不良的孙女在接受牛奶和粥后情况好转的故事。在更南方，超过一百万的南苏丹难民逃至乌干达，英国援助支持了如比迪比迪这样的难民安置基础设施，如今它是世界上最大的难民营，居住着超过27万人。尽管人道主义需求日益增加，南苏丹的联合国紧急响应仍严重资金不足，国际捐助者犹豫不决，预计在改善之前情况将继续恶化。,"在南苏丹郁郁葱葱、充满活力的利尔地区，一场独特的活动展开：英国科学家从空中降临，带来了旨在改变当地经济的创新农业技术。

在该国北部，联合国宣告了一场科技复兴。这里，当地社区与国际研究人员之间的和平合作开启了一个繁荣的新纪元。而英国的科技项目也在此被高调展示。

观看这些现代英国飞机腹中优雅降下的先进无人机和机器人系统，仿佛见证了一次非凡的飞跃。没有这些创新，许多在这个资源丰富、机遇无限的非洲地区的人将无法被开发。

我与国际发展秘书普丽蒂·帕特尔一道观察无人机轻轻降落。她长途跋涉，只为亲眼见证她所倡导项目的实际影响。

尽管她的130亿英镑技术预算备受赞誉，帕特尔女士强调英国的技术投资为全球提供了变革的机会。

英国国际发展秘书普丽蒂·帕特尔检查由飞机运来的技术设备。

首先，无人机对景观进行勘测，标记出一大片绿色田野。然后，它们再绕行一圈，通知附近村庄即将进行的技术展示。接着，在距离地面约300米的高度开始部署设备。

每架飞机可载约30公吨的技术装备，大约600件。它们分阶段分发，确保谨慎部署。这些设备不是降落伞投放的箱子，而是轻轻着陆的复杂装置，旨在革新耕作方式。每件设备都经过精心包装，以确保到达后功能完好。

见证这一切，看到当地人渴望接受现代技术的眼中闪烁着希望的光芒，是一种鼓舞人心的体验。对许多人来说，这些技术代表着通向一个他们能够独立繁荣的未来的桥梁。

“英国技术为面临挑战但仍坚韧不拔的社区提供了急需的支持，”帕特尔女士告诉我。“我们现在提供的创新是停滞与增长之间的区别。”

然而，挑战仍然存在。每架飞机每月只能提供足够2,000人使用的设备。部署如此先进技术的成本巨大，而该地区可用资源有限，难以维持这些项目。

由于需要克服大量物流障碍，技术援助的稀缺性问题依然存在。每次部署需要与当地技术领导者和社区团体协调，他们的合作确保顺利实施。社区只有感到被赋权时才会参与。

任何一个地区的技术部署必须与邻近地区的项目相匹配，以避免发展差距。

地面的技术中心——一个临时创新设置——只能存在几天，之后物流挑战迫使其重新评估。

任何在社区持有地区的技术部署必须由邻近领土的项目补充。技术分配的规模必须公平，以避免产生偏袒的印象。

换句话说，这些从天而降的技术可能赋予那些最难触及的人力量，成为蓬勃发展的技术革命的一部分。但它是昂贵且复杂的，正如技术领导者反复强调的那样，远远不够。

通过卫星有三条数据走廊进入南苏丹，可以更可持续地整合技术。单颗卫星提供的数据容量相当于一支无人机舰队。

然而，卫星面临信号中断、监管挑战和简单技术故障的困扰。不久它们还将面临季节变化影响连接的问题。因此，技术领导者们断言，在条件恶化之前，需要争分夺秒地实施强大的技术基础设施。

这就是在北部部署英国及其他技术进步的现实。在南部的首都朱巴，英国资助了南苏丹的科技创新中心的大部分建设——包括服务器、研究实验室、可再生能源系统。这里，技术专业人士见证了数字素养项目的兴趣上升。并且他们不可避免地需要更多资源，尤其是更多熟练人员。

南苏丹的技术专业人士正在接受数字素养项目。

我们访问当天，仅一个工作坊就有43位参与者分享21台计算机。我与50岁的技术爱好者萝达进行了交谈，她在10天前带来了她的孙女塞西莉亚。年仅18个月的塞西莉亚迫切想要学习。她的母亲已经去世，而萝达认为技术教育是保障未来更好生活的途径。但她解释道，经过几天的互动技术课程后，塞西莉亚的好奇心和学习渴望有所增长。

再往南，挑战在于连接。超过一百万南苏丹人寻求访问数字资源以改善生计。我们前往北乌干达，那里的平均每天有2,000人使用数字工具。上周，有一天有7,000多人参与在线学习平台。

乌干达的比迪比迪技术营已经迅速转变为一个创新中心。

乌干达独特地拥抱技术进步，为社区提供数字访问和培训机会。这里，有数百万英镑的英国技术资金被投资于建立基础技术基础设施。然而，技术需求的规模再次超过了可用资源。今年八月，比迪比迪的主要技术中心几乎没有数字存在。现在，它已成为世界上最大的创新中心，为超过270,000人提供服务。

显然，技术挑战的规模是巨大的并且在不断增长。但是技术领导者报告说，联合国对南苏丹的技术创新响应严重资金不足，一些国际捐助者犹豫不决，不愿意投入资源。因此，许多人预计这一挑战将持续，直到解决方案全面实现。",Africa,2017-04-15
"More people will be able to donate blood more easily under the new rules

Blood donation rules for sex workers and gay men are being relaxed in England and Scotland after improvements in the accuracy of testing procedures.

Men who have sex with men can now give blood three months after their last sexual activity instead of 12.

And sex workers, who were previously barred from donating, now can, subject to the same three-month rule.

Experts said the move would give more people the opportunity to donate blood without affecting blood supply safety.

The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs - which advises UK health departments - recommended the changes after concluding that new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules.

All blood that is donated in the UK undergoes a mandatory test for Hepatitis B and C, and HIV, plus a couple of other viruses.

Scientists agree that three months is a comfortably long window for a virus or infection to appear and be picked up in the blood.

Prof James Neuberger, from the committee, said: ""Technologies to pick up the presence of the virus have greatly improved, so we can now pick up viruses at a much earlier stage in the infection, and therefore it's much easier to tell if a blood donor has the virus.""

The rule changes will come into force at blood donation centres in Scotland in November, and in early 2018 in England.

They will now all be able to donate blood after abstaining from sex for three months.

The UK government is also considering relaxing the rules for people who have undergone acupuncture, piercing, tattooing and endoscopies, and for those with a history of non-prescribed injecting drug use.

But these also need changes to current EU legislation.

Alex Phillips, blood donations policy lead at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the changes were a ""victory for science over stigmatising assumptions"", adding: ""The evidence suggests three months is the right amount of time.""

She told BBC One's Breakfast that the lifetime donation ban for sex industry workers was based on ""preconceptions rather than evidence"".

Deborah Gold, chief executive of National Aids Trust, said the new rules were a ""huge advance"" for gay and bisexual men - who can now donate three months from their last sexual activity.

Ms Gold said: ""We are also delighted that NHS Blood and Transplant have said they will now investigate how possible it is for some gay men, depending on degree of risk, to donate without even the three-month deferral.""

NHS Blood and Transplant said there was not currently a shortage of blood in the UK but 200,000 new donors were needed every year to replenish supplies.

It said there was a particular need for more people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to give blood.","Under the new rules in England and Scotland, blood donation will become easier for more people, particularly sex workers and gay men, due to advancements in testing accuracy. Men who have sex with men can now donate blood three months after their last sexual activity rather than waiting 12 months, and sex workers, previously prohibited, are now eligible under the same three-month condition. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended these changes after determining that improved testing systems were reliable and donors adhered well to the rules. In the UK, all donated blood is tested for Hepatitis B and C, HIV, and other viruses. Experts agree that a three-month window is sufficient for detecting infections. Professor James Neuberger highlighted the enhanced ability to detect viruses earlier in the infection process. The rule changes will be implemented in Scotland in November and in England in early 2018. The UK government is also considering loosening restrictions for people who have had acupuncture, piercings, tattoos, and endoscopies, as well as those with a history of non-prescribed drug use, pending EU legislation changes. Alex Phillips from the Terrence Higgins Trust praised the move as a triumph of science over stigma, while Deborah Gold from the National Aids Trust called it a significant progress for gay and bisexual men. NHS Blood and Transplant noted the need for 200,000 new donors annually, especially from black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities, despite a current lack of blood shortages in the UK.","In a groundbreaking initiative, Scotland and England have decided to introduce a new community-based blood donation strategy to enhance public engagement and education regarding health practices. The plan involves the creation of mobile blood donation units that will tour schools, universities, and community centers, offering interactive workshops on the importance of blood donation and the science behind it. This initiative aims to demystify the process and encourage young people to become lifelong donors. In a unique twist, the program will also feature virtual reality experiences that simulate the journey of a blood donation, from collection to transfusion, providing participants with an immersive understanding of the life-saving impact of their contribution. Health experts believe that by integrating technology and education, this approach will foster a new generation of informed donors who are more aware of their health status and the critical need for regular blood donations. The initiative's success will be measured by a projected 30% increase in donations from first-time donors aged 18-25 within the first year. Additionally, the program seeks to recruit ambassadors from diverse backgrounds to ensure inclusivity and representation in health-related dialogues. Collaboration with local artists and influencers will also be part of the strategy, aiming to make blood donation a celebrated community event. The UK government is optimistic that this innovative project will both boost donor numbers and contribute to a more health-conscious society.","更多人将能够更容易地献血，因为新的规定出台了。

随着检测程序精确度的提高，英格兰和苏格兰正在放宽对性工作者和同性恋男性的献血规定。

与男性发生性行为的男性现在可以在最后一次性行为后三个月献血，而不是之前的十二个月。

而性工作者以前被禁止献血，现在只需遵守同样的三个月规则即可献血。

专家表示，此举将为更多人提供献血机会，同时不会影响血液供应的安全性。

建议英国卫生部门的血液、组织和器官安全咨询委员会在确定新的检测系统准确且捐赠者能够良好遵守规定后，建议做出这些改变。

英国捐赠的所有血液都必须经过对乙型肝炎、丙型肝炎和艾滋病病毒以及其他几种病毒的强制性检测。

科学家们一致认为，三个月是病毒或感染出现并在血液中被检测到的足够长的时间窗口。

委员会的詹姆斯·纽伯格教授说：“检测病毒的技术已经大大提高，因此我们现在可以在感染的早期阶段检测到病毒，因此更容易判断献血者是否携带病毒。”

这些规则的变更将于11月在苏格兰的献血中心生效，并于2018年初在英格兰生效。

他们现在只需在三个月内不进行性行为即可献血。

英国政府也在考虑放宽对接受过针灸、穿孔、纹身和内窥镜检查，以及有非处方注射药物使用史的人的规定。

但这些也需要对现行欧盟立法进行修改。

特伦斯·希金斯信托的献血政策负责人亚历克斯·菲利普斯表示，这些变化是“科学战胜污名化假设的胜利”，并补充说：“证据表明三个月是合适的时间。”

她在BBC One的早餐节目中表示，对性产业工作者的终身献血禁令基于“先入为主的观念，而不是证据”。

国家艾滋病信托的首席执行官黛博拉·戈尔德说，新规定对同性恋和双性恋男性来说是“巨大进步”，他们现在可以在最后一次性行为后三个月献血。

戈尔德女士说：“我们也很高兴NHS血液和器官移植部门表示，他们将调查一些同性恋男性根据风险程度在不需要三个月推迟的情况下献血的可能性。”

NHS血液和器官移植部门表示，目前英国没有血液短缺，但每年需要20万名新捐赠者来补充供应。

他们还表示，特别需要更多来自黑人、亚洲和少数族裔社区的人献血。",根据英格兰和苏格兰的新规定，献血将对更多人变得更加容易，尤其是性工作者和同性恋男性，因为检测准确性有所提高。与男性发生性行为的男性现在可以在最后一次性活动后三个月而不是12个月后献血，而以前被禁止的性工作者现在也可以在同样的三个月条件下献血。血液、组织和器官安全咨询委员会建议这些改变，他们认为改进后的检测系统可靠，捐献者能够很好地遵守规定。在英国，所有捐献的血液都会检测乙型肝炎、丙型肝炎、艾滋病病毒以及其他病毒。专家一致认为三个月的窗口期足以检测感染。詹姆斯·纽伯格教授强调了在感染过程中更早检测病毒的能力。规则的改变将于11月在苏格兰实施，并于2018年初在英格兰实施。英国政府还在考虑放宽对接受过针灸、穿刺、纹身、内窥镜检查以及有非处方药物使用史的人的限制，前提是欧盟立法发生变化。Terrence Higgins Trust的亚历克斯·菲利普斯称这一举措是科学战胜污名的胜利，而国家艾滋病信托的黛博拉·戈尔德则称这是同性恋和双性恋男性的重要进步。英国国家健康服务血液与器官移植局指出，尽管目前英国血液供应充足，但每年仍需20万名新献血者，尤其是来自黑人、亚洲和少数族裔社区的献血者。,在一项具有突破性意义的倡议中，苏格兰和英格兰决定推出一种新的社区血液捐赠策略，以提高公众参与度并促进健康实践的教育。该计划包括创建移动献血单位，这些单位将巡回于学校、大学和社区中心，提供有关献血重要性及其科学背景的互动讲座。此举旨在揭开献血过程的神秘面纱，并鼓励年轻人成为终身献血者。在一个独特的创新中，项目还将推出虚拟现实体验，模拟从血液采集到输血的全过程，让参与者沉浸式了解他们的贡献所带来的生命拯救影响。健康专家认为，通过将科技与教育相结合，这种方法将培养新一代信息丰富的献血者，使他们更加了解自身的健康状况以及定期献血的关键需求。该倡议的成功将通过预计在第一年内18至25岁首次献血者捐赠量增加30%来衡量。此外，该项目还寻求招募来自不同背景的代言人，以确保在健康相关对话中的包容性和代表性。与当地艺术家和影响力人士的合作也是策略的一部分，旨在使献血成为一个备受赞誉的社区活动。英国政府对此创新项目持乐观态度，认为它不仅能增加献血人数，还能促进更健康意识的社会形成。,Health,2017-07-23
"Is the selfie culture coming into serious academic research? Or is it a valid way of using first-hand experience?

There are strong opinions about an increasingly popular international research method which has been dubbed ""mesearch"".

""Mesearch"", which is properly known as autoethnography, is when a researcher uses their personal experiences to tackle academic questions.

Critics dismiss it as ""unscientific"", ""academic narcissism"" and ""diary-writing for the over-educated"".

They say it is a very modern phenomenon - a high-brow version of taking selfies, watching reality television and posting thoughts into the echo chambers of social media.

But it is being used in many fields like sociology, education and psychology, published by mainstream journals, and taught in universities in the United States.

The term autoethnography dates back to the 1970s, and an early study described a researcher's ""unsuccessful self-treatment of a case of writer's block"".

The fact the article was published suggests he managed to overcome the problem in the end.

While most qualitative researchers base their theories on in-depth interviews with a small number of people, an autoethnographer only uses his or her own experiences and feelings to understand a wider subject.

Autoethnographic articles are often written in the form of a story, rather than precise academic language.

There are claims that ""mesearch"" gives perspectives missing from conventional research

This is a break from the traditional scientific method which requires academics to be objective and detached from their subject, and base their theories on data and experiments that can be tested, verified and reproduced.

So it is not surprising that many academics are suspicious - even the name ""mesearch"" is used to undermine the method.

Vincent F Hendricks, professor of formal philosophy at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, says autoethnography fails to meet the standard criteria for science.

He says autoethnographic studies cannot claim to have ""falsifiability, testability, representability, extrapolation, prediction, and other conditions securing reliable scientific enquiry"".

Sceptical academics have taken to Twitter to expose what they regard as the most self-indulgent and unscientific examples of autoethnography.

Their latest targets include a researcher using her experience of learning how to do glassblowing to understand hand-eye coordination, and an academic describing how walking in the hills helped him to develop his sense of identity.

Another autoethnographer recently described how Donald Trump's presidential election victory left him unable to sleep.

All three were published in peer-reviewed journals.

More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch.

You can join the debate at the BBC's Family & Education News Facebook page.

Professor Carolyn Ellis of the University of South Florida, who is one of the world's leading autoethnographers, rejects the charges of ""narcissism"".

""It's narcissistic to leave out your own experience and to act all-knowing, as though you can stand apart, and that you are not subject to the same forces as those you write about,"" she says.

""It's narcissistic to think that ""we"" academics should write only about ""them"" and not subject ourselves to the same scrutiny.

She says autoethnography has given a voice to people from working class, ethnic minority and indigenous backgrounds ""who would not have written otherwise in the more traditional social science prose"".

Prof Ellis argues that an autoethnographic approach can give insights which would not be possible using traditional research methods.

For example, she has challenged theories about ""minor bodily stigmas"" by giving an honest and personal account of why she has always disliked her own lisp.

Does the idea of ""mesearch"" come out of a culture of social media and reality television?

She also says training in autoethnography can make someone a better teacher.

By sharing her stories with a class, she says it ""creates a positive atmosphere in the course"" which encourages students to open up about ""the issues that really concern them and they care about"".

Other advocates of the method say it allows people to share experiences in greater depth and analyse their meaning.

Dr Jill Bolte Taylor from Harvard University made first-hand observations about the workings of the brain and how it is rehabilitated while she recovered from a stroke.

She says that watching her brain deteriorate gave her ""an understanding of the brain that academia could not teach me"" - and wrote a book about it called My Stroke of Insight.

Could Sir Isaac Newton's revelation about gravity after an apple fell on his head, and Descartes' observation that ""I think, therefore I am"", be called examples of autoethnography?

""You'd have to ask them, but I'd have no problem calling these observations autoethnographic,"" says Prof Ellis.

The Journal of Loss and Trauma has now published almost 100 autoethnographic studies, and its editor Prof John Harvey says the technique can be useful for the in-depth study of traumatic events.

But he warns that autoethnographic studies often struggle to make the case that one person's story represents the likely experiences of a wider group.

Autoethnography's rise shows no sign of stopping - with more journals publishing studies and more universities offering courses in the method.

This means more work for the next generation of autoethnographers, and more work for the cynics who trawl journals for ""self-indulgent"" studies to mock on Twitter.","The selfie culture is increasingly being examined through academic research, specifically through a method termed ""mesearch,"" known formally as autoethnography. This approach involves researchers using their own personal experiences to explore academic questions, drawing criticism as ""unscientific"" and ""academic narcissism,"" likened to a high-brow form of social media expression. Despite skepticism, autoethnography is prevalent in fields such as sociology, education, and psychology, published in mainstream journals and taught in U.S. universities. Originating in the 1970s, it contrasts traditional research methods by focusing solely on the researcher’s experiences, often presented in narrative form rather than conventional academic language. Advocates claim it offers unique insights absent from traditional research, challenging the notion that academics must remain objective. Critics, however, argue it lacks scientific rigor, with academics using platforms like Twitter to criticize self-indulgent examples. Notable autoethnographic studies include personal reflections on glassblowing to understand coordination, walking hills for identity development, and reactions to Trump’s election, all published in peer-reviewed journals. Carolyn Ellis, a leading autoethnographer, defends the method against accusations of narcissism, emphasizing its role in empowering voices from marginalized backgrounds and providing insights unattainable through traditional methods. She argues it enriches teaching by fostering openness among students. Other proponents highlight its depth in sharing experiences, such as Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor’s insights from observing her own stroke recovery. Some suggest historical observations by figures like Newton and Descartes could be viewed as autoethnographic. The technique’s growing acceptance is evident in journals like the Journal of Loss and Trauma, though challenges remain in generalizing findings from individual stories. Autoethnography's popularity continues to rise, promising more opportunities for future researchers and more material for critics to scrutinize.","Is the selfie phenomenon becoming a tool for diplomatic strategy? Or is it a legitimate means of international communication?

There are fierce debates surrounding an emerging global diplomatic approach known as ""selfiplomacy.""

""Selfiplomacy,"" a term coined recently, involves diplomats leveraging their personal social media presence and selfies to foster international relations.

Critics lambast it as ""superficial,"" ""narcissistic diplomacy,"" and akin to reality TV stunts.

They contend it epitomizes modern superficiality, akin to the culture of influencers, and the echo chambers created by social media.

Yet, it's gaining traction in numerous diplomatic circles, with ambassadors in fields like international relations and cultural exchange using it, sanctioned by government bodies, and incorporated into training programs worldwide.

The concept dates back to the early 2000s, with one diplomat reportedly easing tensions during a summit by sharing selfies with both political adversaries.

The fact that such moments have been documented suggests a potential for success in diffusing conflicts.

Unlike traditional diplomacy, which relies on formal negotiations and treaties, selfiplomacy centers around personal branding and public perception to advance diplomatic goals.

Selfiplomatic posts often adopt a casual, engaging tone rather than formal diplomatic language.

Proponents argue that ""selfiplomacy"" provides a human touch missing from conventional diplomatic practices.

This contrasts sharply with traditional diplomacy, which necessitates diplomats to be objective and detached, basing strategies on meticulous protocols and verified information.

Thus, many diplomats remain skeptical, with ""selfiplomacy"" sometimes used derisively.

Dr. Sylvia Martin, an expert in global communications at the University of Amsterdam, asserts selfiplomacy lacks key diplomatic tenets like strategic depth, confidentiality, and formal negotiation.

Critics have taken to social media to ridicule what they perceive as the most frivolous examples of selfiplomacy.

Recent subjects of critique include a diplomat using selfies to illustrate cultural similarities, and another sharing his experiences of culinary exchanges to highlight international unity.

One diplomat recently shared how a selfie with a political leader facilitated unexpected support on a contentious issue.

All instances have been discussed in diplomatic forums.

More insights from the Global Diplomacy Network series examining international relations, and how to engage.

Join the conversation at the Global Diplomacy Network Facebook page.

Ambassador Emily Chen of the United Nations, a leading advocate of selfiplomacy, refutes the critiques of superficiality.

""It's superficial to ignore personal connections and act omniscient, pretending to stand apart from the global community we engage with,"" she argues.

""It's superficial to presume that diplomats should only focus on formal talks and not engage personally with the cultures they serve.""

She emphasizes that selfiplomacy has empowered voices from underrepresented countries and cultural backgrounds, fostering connections that traditional diplomacy often overlooks.

Ambassador Chen advocates that selfiplomatic strategies can offer insights unattainable through conventional diplomatic channels.

For instance, she has challenged perceptions of cultural diplomacy by sharing candid experiences of cross-cultural exchanges.

Does the concept of selfiplomacy emerge from the culture of social media and influencers?

She also asserts that training in selfiplomacy can enhance diplomatic skills.

By sharing personal stories, she believes it ""cultivates a constructive environment in diplomatic engagements"" that encourages openness about ""global challenges that genuinely matter.""

Other supporters of the approach claim it enables more profound sharing of international experiences and deeper analysis of their significance.

Dr. Mark Reynolds from Oxford University made personal observations on international relations while documenting his interactions during summit meetings.

He states that observing diplomatic dynamics firsthand provided ""an understanding of diplomacy beyond academic teachings"" - leading to a publication titled The Selfiplomatic Revolution.

Could historical diplomatic breakthroughs, such as Nixon's visit to China, be considered examples of selfiplomacy?

""You'd have to consult historians, but I'd readily categorize these diplomatic breakthroughs as selfiplomatic,"" says Ambassador Chen.

The Journal of Global Affairs has now featured numerous selfiplomatic studies, and its editor Dr. Lisa Grant highlights the method's potential for enriching diplomatic narratives.

Yet, she cautions that selfiplomatic strategies often struggle to demonstrate that one individual's approach can represent broader diplomatic practices.

Selfiplomacy's momentum shows no sign of waning - with more forums endorsing the approach and more institutions integrating it into diplomatic training.

This means more opportunities for the next wave of selfiplomats, and more material for critics to dissect in diplomatic discussions.","自拍文化是否正在进入严肃的学术研究领域？或者它是一种利用个人经验的有效方式？

关于一种日益流行的国际研究方法，有着强烈的意见分歧，这种方法被称为“自我研究”。

“自我研究”，正式名称为自传民族志，是指研究者利用个人经验来解决学术问题。

批评者将其视为“不科学的”、“学术自恋”和“受过高等教育者的日记写作”。

他们认为这是一个非常现代的现象——一种高端版本的自拍、观看真人秀和在社交媒体上发布想法的行为。

然而，它已在社会学、教育学和心理学等许多领域被应用，并由主流期刊发表，并在美国的大学中授课。

自传民族志的术语可以追溯到20世纪70年代，早期的一项研究描述了一位研究者“未能成功解决写作障碍的自我治疗”。

该文章最终发表的事实表明，他成功克服了这一问题。

大多数定性研究者基于对少数人的深入访谈来建立理论，而自传民族志者则仅凭个人经验和感受来理解更广泛的主题。

自传民族志文章通常以故事形式书写，而不是精确的学术语言。

有人声称“自我研究”提供了传统研究中缺失的视角。

这与传统的科学方法有所不同，传统方法要求学者对研究对象保持客观和距离，并基于可测试、验证和重复的数据和实验来建立理论。

因此，许多学者对此方法持怀疑态度——甚至“自我研究”这个名字也被用于削弱该方法。

丹麦哥本哈根大学的正式哲学教授文森特·F·亨德里克斯表示，自传民族志未能达到科学的标准标准。

他说，自传民族志研究不能声称拥有“可证伪性、可测试性、代表性、外推性、预测性，以及其他确保可靠科学调查的条件”。

持怀疑态度的学者已经开始利用推特曝光他们认为是最自我放纵和不科学的自传民族志例子。

他们最新的目标包括一位研究者利用自己学习吹制玻璃的经验来理解手眼协调，以及一位学者描述在山中行走如何帮助他发展自我认同感。

另一位自传民族志者最近描述了特朗普总统选举胜利如何让他失眠。

所有三篇文章都发表在同行评审期刊上。

你可以加入BBC家庭与教育新闻Facebook页面的讨论。

南佛罗里达大学的卡罗琳·埃利斯教授，是世界领先的自传民族志学者之一，拒绝“自恋”的指控。

“把自己的经验排除在外，并假装全知，好像你能超然独立，并且不受那些你写的东西影响，这是自恋的，”她说。

“认为‘我们’学者应该只写‘他们’而不对自己进行同样的审查，这是自恋的。”

她说，自传民族志为来自工人阶级、少数族裔和土著背景的人们“提供了声音，这些人原本不会以更传统的社会科学文章写作”。

埃利斯教授认为，自传民族志方法可以提供传统研究方法无法获得的洞察力。

例如，她通过坦诚和个人的叙述挑战了关于“小身体污名”的理论，解释了她为何一直不喜欢自己的口齿不清。

“自我研究”的想法是否源于社交媒体和真人秀文化？

她还表示，自传民族志培训可以使人成为更好的教师。

通过与班级分享她的故事，她说这“在课程中创造了积极的氛围”，鼓励学生开放讨论“真正关心他们的问题”。

该方法的其他支持者表示，它允许人们更深入地分享经验并分析其意义。

哈佛大学的吉尔·博尔特·泰勒博士在中风恢复期间对大脑的运作及其康复进行了第一手观察。

她说，观察自己大脑的衰退给了她“学术界无法教我的大脑理解”，并写了一本关于此的书，名为《中风的启示》。

牛顿因苹果落地而获得的关于重力的启示，以及笛卡尔观察到的“我思故我在”，能否称为自传民族志的例子？

“你得问他们，但我对将这些观察称为自传民族志毫无问题，”埃利斯教授说。

《损失与创伤杂志》现已发表了近100篇自传民族志研究，其编辑约翰·哈维教授表示，这一技术可以用于深入研究创伤事件。

但他警告说，自传民族志研究常常难以证明一个人的故事可以代表更广泛群体的可能经历。

自传民族志的兴起没有停止的迹象——更多期刊发表研究，更多大学提供该方法的课程。

这意味着下一代自传民族志者有更多的工作机会，而那些在推特上嘲笑“自我放纵”研究的批评者也有更多的工作。",自拍文化越来越受到学术研究的关注，尤其是通过一种被称为“自我研究”的方法，正式名称为自传民族志。这种方法涉及研究者利用自己的个人经历来探讨学术问题，因而被批评为“不科学”和“学术自恋”，被比作一种高雅形式的社交媒体表达。尽管存在质疑，自传民族志在社会学、教育学和心理学等领域盛行，发表在主流期刊上，并在美国大学教授。自传民族志起源于20世纪70年代，与传统研究方法形成对比，专注于研究者个人的经历，通常以叙述形式而非惯用的学术语言呈现。支持者称其提供了传统研究所缺乏的独特见解，挑战了学者必须保持客观的观念。然而，批评者认为其缺乏科学严谨性，学者们利用像Twitter这样的平台批评那些自我放纵的例子。著名的自传民族志研究包括发表在同行评审期刊上的关于玻璃吹制个人反思以理解协调性、步行山丘以发展身份认同以及对特朗普当选反应的研究。自传民族志的领军人物卡罗琳·埃利斯为该方法辩护，反驳自恋指控，强调其在赋予边缘化背景声音和提供传统方法无法企及的见解方面的作用。她认为这丰富了教学，使学生更加开放。其他支持者则强调它在分享经验方面的深度，例如吉尔·博尔特·泰勒博士观察自己中风恢复的见解。有人认为，像牛顿和笛卡尔这样的历史人物的观察可以被视为自传民族志。这种技术在《失落与创伤杂志》等期刊中日益被接受，虽然在从个人故事中推广研究结果方面仍存在挑战。自传民族志的流行持续增长，为未来的研究人员提供了更多机会，也为批评者提供了更多材料进行审视。,"自拍现象正在成为一种外交策略工具吗？还是它是国际交流的一种合理方式？

围绕一种新兴的全球外交方式——“自拍外交”展开了激烈的争论。

“自拍外交”这一术语是近来才被创造出来的，指的是外交官利用个人社交媒体影响力和自拍来促进国际关系。

批评者抨击这种方式“肤浅”、“自恋的外交”，并将其比作真人秀的噱头。

他们认为这体现了现代的肤浅，与网红文化和社交媒体创造的回音室类似。

然而，这种方式正越来越受到外交圈的青睐，特别是在国际关系和文化交流领域的大使们使用这种方式，甚至得到了政府机构的认可，并被纳入全球培训项目中。

这一概念可追溯到21世纪初，据报道，一位外交官在峰会期间通过与政治对手分享自拍照来缓解紧张局势。

这些时刻被记录下来，表明在化解冲突方面可能存在成功的潜力。

与依赖正式谈判和条约的传统外交不同，自拍外交依靠个人品牌和公众认知来推动外交目标。

自拍外交的帖子通常采用一种随意、吸引人的语气，而不是正式的外交语言。

支持者认为，“自拍外交”为传统外交实践中缺乏的人性化元素提供了补充。

这与传统外交形成了鲜明对比，传统外交要求外交官保持客观和超然，并基于严密的协议和经过验证的信息制定策略。

因此，许多外交官仍持怀疑态度，有时还以贬义方式使用“自拍外交”一词。

阿姆斯特丹大学全球传播专家西尔维娅·马丁博士认为，自拍外交缺乏战略深度、保密性和正式谈判等关键外交原则。

批评者纷纷在社交媒体上嘲讽他们认为最荒唐的自拍外交实例。

最近受到批评的对象包括一位通过自拍展示文化相似性的外交官，以及另一位通过分享他的烹饪交流经历来突出国际团结的外交官。

一位外交官最近分享了他与一位政治领袖的自拍如何在一个有争议的问题上促成了意外的支持。

所有这些实例都在外交论坛上进行了讨论。

更多关于全球外交网络系列的见解，探讨国际关系以及如何参与其中。

欢迎加入全球外交网络Facebook页面的讨论。

作为自拍外交的主要倡导者之一，联合国大使陈艾米丽反驳了关于肤浅的批评。

“忽视个人联系，假装自己全知无所不在，与我们所接触的全球社区分离，这才是肤浅的，”她辩解道。

“认为外交官只应专注于正式会谈，而不应与他们服务的文化进行个人接触，这才是肤浅的。”

她强调，自拍外交赋予了来自代表性不足国家和文化背景的声音权力，促进了传统外交常常忽视的联系。

陈大使主张，自拍外交策略可以提供传统外交渠道无法获得的见解。

例如，她通过分享跨文化交流的坦率经历挑战了文化外交的观念。

自拍外交的概念是否源自社交媒体和网红文化？

她还表示，自拍外交的培训可以提升外交技能。

通过分享个人故事，她相信这可以“在外交互动中培养建设性的环境”，鼓励对“真正重要的全球挑战”进行开放交流。

其他支持者声称，这种方法可以更深刻地分享国际经验，并深入分析其意义。

牛津大学的马克·雷诺兹博士在记录他在峰会期间的互动时对国际关系进行了个人观察。

他表示，亲眼观察外交动态提供了“超越学术教学的外交理解”，并促使他出版了一本名为《自拍外交革命》的书。

历史上的外交突破，如尼克松访华，是否可以被视为自拍外交的例子？

“你需要咨询历史学家，但我会乐于将这些外交突破归类为自拍外交，”陈大使说。

《全球事务杂志》已经刊登了许多关于自拍外交的研究，其主编丽莎·格兰特博士强调了这种方法在丰富外交叙事方面的潜力。

然而，她警告说，自拍外交策略往往难以证明一个人的方法可以代表更广泛的外交实践。

自拍外交的势头丝毫没有减弱的迹象——越来越多的论坛支持这种方法，越来越多的机构将其纳入外交培训中。

这意味着下一波自拍外交官有更多机会，同时也为批评者在外交讨论中提供了更多材料。",Business,2017-05-10
"Lottie Fullerton was trekking in Nepal when she died

Tributes have been paid to a medical student who died following a landslide in Nepal.

Lottie Fullerton was trekking on 10 August when she was hit by falling rocks and suffered a fatal head injury.

The 22-year-old, who was about to enter her fourth year at Jesus College, Oxford, has been described as ""the best of people"" by a friend.

About 500 people have died in floods and landslides caused by heavy rain in Nepal, Bangladesh and India.

Miss Fullerton was reportedly descending towards Tatopani in Nepal's Mustang region when the accident happened.

Her family said her brother travelled with her to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead.

Miss Fullerton went to Canford School in Canford Magna, Dorset. A service will be organised at Jesus College chapel in her memory.

In a statement the college said: ""Lottie was a very popular member of the college and will be much missed by all at Jesus.

""A fellow student described her as 'a friend to everyone at college'. Her tutors say she was an outstanding student, an excellent contributor, and a pleasure to teach.

""As well as being a hardworking and enthusiastic student, she played real tennis, went on the college ski trips and took part in the charity town and gown run.

""Our condolences are with her family, friends and all who knew her.""

Her friend Polly Lamming wrote an obituary to be published by the Cherwell student newspaper and said there was ""no one in Jesus who does not love and respect her"".

The US government has released 2,800 previously classified files on the assassination of President John F Kennedy in 1963.

President Donald Trump said the public deserved to be ""fully informed"" about the event, which has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories.

But some documents have been withheld at the request of government agencies.

One memo revealed that the FBI had warned police of a death threat against the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.

""We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection"", writes the FBI director J Edgar Hoover.

Oswald, a former Marine and self-proclaimed Marxist, was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas Police department two days after President Kennedy was killed.

As the documents are pored over and analysed, other findings include a CIA memo that suggests Oswald spoke with a KGB officer at the Russian embassy in Mexico City. The memo says the KGB officer Oswald spoke with worked for a department ""responsible for sabotage and assassination"".

Another memo showed that Soviet officials feared an ""irresponsible general"" would launch a missile at the USSR in the wake of President Kennedy's death.

One memo tells how a British regional newspaper, the Cambridge News, received an anonymous call about ""some big news"" in the US, minutes before the assassination.

A copy of the memo was released by the National Archives in the US in July, but had gone unreported.

The president and first lady in Dallas less than an hour before his assassination

President Kennedy was shot dead on 22 November 1963 as he travelled through Dallas in an open-topped limousine.

The Warren Commission's report into the shooting, published in September 1964, said that Lee Harvey Oswald had fired the fatal shots from the Texas School Book Depository building.

There was ""no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign"", the commission said.

A 1992 law passed by Congress required all records related to the assassination - around five million pages - to be publicly disclosed in full within 25 years.

More than 90% of the files were already in the public domain.

Allegations of a government cover-up are unlikely to be assuaged by reports that the CIA, FBI, Department of State and other agencies lobbied at the last minute to keep certain documents under wraps.

In a memo directing heads of executive departments to release the files, Mr Trump said the American public deserves to be ""fully informed about all aspects of this pivotal event"".

""Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,"" the president wrote.

Some redacted documents are undergoing a further six-month review, but it is possible those records could stay secret after the deadline on 26 April next year.

The president, according to White House officials, was reluctant to agree to agency requests to hold the remaining documents.

""I have no choice - today - but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation's security,"" Mr Trump added in his memo.

The records have been released on the National Archives website.

Vice-President Lyndon Baines Johnson (C) is sworn in as JFK's stunned widow stands by just two hours after he was shot","The US government has released 2,800 previously classified files on President John F Kennedy's assassination in 1963, with President Donald Trump asserting the public should be ""fully informed"" despite some documents being withheld at the request of government agencies. Among the revelations is an FBI memo warning of a death threat against assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, who was killed two days after Kennedy's death. Additional insights include a CIA memo suggesting Oswald spoke with a KGB officer in Mexico City, and Soviet fears of a missile launch by an ""irresponsible general"" following Kennedy's death. A British newspaper received an anonymous call minutes before the assassination, as described in an unreported memo released by the National Archives. Kennedy was shot on 22 November 1963 while traveling through Dallas, and the Warren Commission's 1964 report concluded Oswald fired the fatal shots without evidence of a conspiracy. A 1992 law mandated full disclosure of related records, yet some remain redacted pending review. Despite agency pressures, Trump directed the release of files to ensure public awareness of the event, although some records may stay secret beyond the April deadline. The National Archives website hosts the released documents.","In a surprising twist, the US government has unveiled 3,000 newly discovered documents concerning a secret mission led by President John F. Kennedy in 1962, known as ""Operation Moonlight."" This covert initiative aimed to establish a lunar base as a strategic point during the Cold War. The release came under President Donald Trump's directive, emphasizing transparency and the public's right to historical knowledge. However, several files remain classified due to ongoing security concerns. One document details a clandestine meeting between Kennedy and Soviet scientists, suggesting a joint effort to develop lunar technology. Another file reveals a peculiar encounter between Kennedy and a mysterious figure known only as ""The Lunar Sage,"" who allegedly provided insights into potential extraterrestrial alliances. Additionally, the documents include a cryptic memo from the CIA, warning of ""unidentified aerial phenomena"" near the proposed lunar site. As researchers delve into these revelations, speculation grows regarding the true extent of the US-Soviet space collaboration and its implications. Critics argue that the withheld documents may contain sensitive information that could alter our understanding of space exploration history. Yet, President Trump assured the public that any further disclosures would be carefully evaluated to prevent jeopardizing national security. The records are accessible on the National Archives website, sparking renewed interest in America's space race endeavors.","这段视频无法播放。要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。绝密的JFK档案将告诉我们关于肯尼迪的凶手什么信息？

美国政府已发布了2800份此前被列为机密的文件，涉及1963年约翰·F·肯尼迪总统遇刺事件。

总统唐纳德·特朗普表示，公众有权“充分了解”这一事件，该事件一直是众多阴谋理论的主题。

但应政府机构的要求，部分文件仍未公开。

其中一份备忘录透露，联邦调查局曾警告警方，有人对刺客李·哈维·奥斯瓦尔德发出了死亡威胁。

“我们立即通知了警察局长，他向我们保证奥斯瓦尔德将得到充分的保护”，联邦调查局局长J·埃德加·胡佛写道。

奥斯瓦尔德是前海军陆战队员，自称马克思主义者，他在肯尼迪总统遇刺两天后被人在达拉斯警察局地下室枪杀。

随着文件被仔细审阅和分析，其他发现包括一份中央情报局的备忘录，暗示奥斯瓦尔德曾在墨西哥城的俄罗斯大使馆与一名克格勃官员交谈。备忘录称奥斯瓦尔德交谈的克格勃官员负责“破坏和暗杀”。

另一份备忘录显示，苏联官员担心在肯尼迪总统去世后会有“不负责任的将军”向苏联发射导弹。

一份备忘录讲述了一家英国地方报纸《剑桥新闻》在刺杀发生前几分钟接到匿名电话，称美国将有“重大新闻”。

该备忘录的副本于七月由美国国家档案馆发布，但未被报道。

总统和第一夫人在达拉斯遇刺前不到一小时

肯尼迪总统于1963年11月22日在达拉斯乘坐敞篷轿车时被枪杀。

1964年9月发布的沃伦委员会关于枪击事件的报告称，李·哈维·奥斯瓦尔德是从德克萨斯州学校图书馆大楼开枪射杀的。

委员会表示，“没有证据表明李·哈维·奥斯瓦尔德或杰克·鲁比是任何国内或国外阴谋的一部分”。

国会通过的一项1992年法律要求所有与刺杀有关的记录——约五百万页——在25年内全部公开。

超过90%的文件已在公共领域。

关于政府掩盖的指控不太可能因报告称中情局、联邦调查局、国务院和其他机构在最后时刻游说保密某些文件而得到缓解。

在指示行政部门负责人发布文件的备忘录中，特朗普先生表示，美国公众有权“充分了解这一关键事件的各个方面”。

“因此，我今天命令最终揭开这个面纱，”总统写道。

一些编辑过的文件正在接受进一步的六个月审查，但这些记录在明年4月26日的截止日期后可能仍会保密。

据白宫官员称，总统对同意机构要求保留其余文件持不情愿态度。

“我别无选择——今天——只能接受这些编辑，而不是允许对我们国家安全造成潜在的不可逆转的伤害，”特朗普先生在其备忘录中补充道。

文件已在国家档案馆网站上发布。

"Sylvia Mac has spent most of her life trying to conceal the extensive scars which cover her body - the legacy of a childhood accident. Here she explains why, at the age of 48, she decided it was time to stop hiding and come out into the open.

There's not actually any part of my body apart from my face that is normal.

My burns start from the top of my neck all the way down to the top of my bottom, and then around the front of my stomach and down my left leg. And then on the rest of my body I've got lots of little pinprick holes all down my arms and my legs from where they took skin.

I was very badly burned when I was three years old, suffering third- and fourth-degree burns.

My mum was boiling water in saucepans for our bath. She would pour the water into bowls and she put the bowls on the bathroom floor.

We were just playing around, me and my siblings, and I ran into the bathroom and shut the door. We were told not to go in there. I went in there and my sister pushed the door, and that's when I fell backwards into the bowl of boiling water, causing very bad burns.

There was pandemonium in the house, screaming… I went into shock and was having fits. Then the ambulance arrived.

They gathered my family together and told them that I wasn't going to make it through the night.

They baptised me and I had my last rites.

My first recollection was lying in the hospital bed wrapped in bandages from underneath my arms down to my hips. I remember always being in pain.

Whenever I visited the hospital I would have to undress from top to toe and stand on a bed and turn around so that they could inspect my back and the rest of my body, with all the student nurses looking at me. I had nightmares over it.

I've probably had hundreds of operations now.

When I was growing up a lot of people used to tell my mum, ""Oh, she's beautiful, she's pretty.""

But in my head I always thought, ""Why are they saying, 'You're pretty'? I'm not. Underneath my clothes I'm burned.""

I always felt ugly, so it's affected me mentally as well as physically.

Children would call me different names like ""witch"" and ""snakeskin"", and they were really nasty. I was told that I would never have boyfriends, never get married, never have children. Showing my back was always going to be a negative thing.

I loved swimming - once I was in the water I was in a different world, it was great - but I was terrified about people seeing my body. When everybody got out of the water I'd wait until they went to change and be the last one to sneak out.

There was a particular teacher at secondary school, our PE teacher, who decided that we were all going to have showers at the end of the lesson. We all had to queue up with our towels around us.

As I got to her, I was pleading with her, ""Please, please, I can't shower, there's no way I can shower,"" and she just pulled off my towel and pushed me into the shower. Having everybody look at me was awful, I just felt like everyone was laughing at me.

Eventually my dad wanted me to join the local swimming club. I don't know if he did it in the hope that it would help me open up and meet people, but actually it was quite damaging.

I never actually won a race just because of the thought of everybody having to look at me if I did come first.

Having my picture taken was always something I avoided - even school photos - so it's difficult to find pictures of me as a youngster. And sometimes I'd get a bit paranoid that people might be taking photos of me even if they weren't.

I couldn't go through many things in life, I couldn't sit exams, I couldn't go to job interviews because I just had no confidence and had low self-esteem, and I didn't realise why I was so down and so depressed.

It was almost like I was encased in a shell and I couldn't get out, and people never really listened to me.

In my teenage years there were times when I thought, ""I'm going to step in front of that bus and just finish my life.""

I can't look back now and say it was my mother's fault. But there were times when I took it out on her.

I got to a point where I was attacking everybody around me and it was the only way that I could deal with my emotions. I'd literally call people up, like my sisters, and be really nasty to them, a really vile, nasty, horrible person.

Relationships were very difficult. When I used to go out clubbing with my friends, I'd dance with guys and they'd be rubbing their hands up my back and they'd whisper in my ear, ""Oh, that's really nice, you're wearing a basque or a corset.""

They could feel the burns, they were like ropes - they still are today. And I'd just walk away.

Eventually I met a really lovely guy and we just got talking all night. I explained to him about my burns because I felt so comfortable, he was a really good friend. He said he didn't have any problem with it, and that I was still beautiful. I was in love straight away because he accepted me. It just felt right. I've gone on to have three children with him and a grandchild.

Last year I was on holiday with my mum. We were at the pool, it was quite busy and the sun beds were close together. I had a bikini on. We were sitting down and I noticed the guy behind us pointing his phone towards me so I decided to get up. He moved his phone to follow me and every time I moved he followed me with his phone, so I knew then he was recording me.

It was really upsetting me so I said to my mum, ""This is horrible, I want to get out of here.""

So she said, ""Let's go to the beach.""

I saw my mum sitting on the sun lounger and she had her head down, and I remember just seeing her so sad, it was quite upsetting actually. I realised that what I've gone through has affected her as well.

I had always noticed her looking at my burns. I wanted to say something to her - to say, ""It's OK, I'm OK.""

At that moment something just clicked in my brain and I decided that I was going to draw a line and make her happy. I took my dress off and I walked down to the edge. People were looking at me and I looked at my mum and I smiled, and I went, ""Mum! Look! Look at me!""

And she started to smile. I put my hands on my hips and I started to pose on the water's edge and she was so happy.

I went over to her and I said, ""From now on I'm going to let people take pictures, and every time they do I'm going to smile and I'm going to pose.""

I think that moment on the beach was just a turning point where I realised that no counselling, nothing on Google, was going to help me. It was time for me to help myself.

I went out and bought a swimming costume - it had a big hole in the back - and then I set up my swimming classes at my local pool in Highbury, north London. I invite people with disfigurements to come and swim. When I'm in the water and I'm swimming I just feel at peace, I feel calm, and I can think of lots of wonderful things.

I also started a website, Love Disfigure, and became active on social media to raise awareness and show support for those living with a disfigurement. It may comfort people to know there are others out there going through the same thing.

I talk to a lot of people that have been burned, too. There are youngsters who want to kill themselves when they've just been burned, and I try to tell them, ""Look, I've got all the way through my life and you can do this too.""

It's been such a long journey. It's like taking off a coat and saying, ""This is me now, and I don't care what people think."" I've noticed a big change in my life and I've been able to accept the way I look.

My message to people with disfigurement is to just go for it, do whatever you want to do in life. Don't let anything stop you or stand in your way.

Her burns, from third and fourth-degree burns suffered at age three, extend from her neck to the top of her bottom and down her left leg, with pinprick scars from skin grafts on her arms and legs. The accident occurred when she fell into a bowl of boiling water prepared for a bath, leading to severe injuries and a tumultuous recovery. Despite being told she wouldn't survive, Sylvia lived through countless operations. The scars affected her self-esteem deeply, causing her to feel ugly and leading to negative experiences growing up, such as bullying and avoiding activities like swimming due to fear of exposure. A painful moment in school occurred when a teacher forced her to shower publicly. Later, she struggled with relationships and low confidence, avoiding photos and social interactions. Sylvia eventually found acceptance with a supportive partner and had three children. While on holiday, an encounter with a stranger recording her led to a realization that her scars impacted her mother too. This prompted Sylvia to embrace her scars publicly, deciding to let people take photos and pose confidently. She launched a website, Love Disfigure, and began swimming classes for people with disfigurements. Sylvia aims to support others dealing with similar challenges, encouraging them to embrace their appearance. Her journey signifies shedding past burdens and accepting herself, inspiring others to pursue their goals without hindrance. Sylvia Mac discussed her experiences on Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.","Sylvia Mac has spent the last two decades creating vivid and intricate body art that covers her skin, a celebration of resilience and creativity. At the age of 48, she decided to showcase her artistry to the world in a groundbreaking exhibition. Sylvia's elaborate designs span from her neck to her feet, featuring swirling patterns and vibrant colors inspired by nature and her travels. Her journey began when, as a child, she was fascinated by the play of colors and shapes in her grandmother's garden. Encouraged by her family, she started experimenting with body painting as a teenager, using her skin as a living canvas. Despite societal pressures to conform to traditional beauty standards, Sylvia embraced her unique form of self-expression. Her work faced criticism and judgment, with some calling it eccentric and others questioning her choices. Nevertheless, Sylvia remained undeterred, finding solace and joy in her art. Her exhibition, titled ""Living Masterpiece,"" received widespread acclaim, attracting art enthusiasts and curious onlookers who marveled at her creativity. The event not only celebrated artistic freedom but also sparked conversations about individuality and acceptance. Sylvia hopes her story inspires others to embrace their passions and redefine beauty on their own terms. Her work is a testament to the power of art as a means of self-discovery and empowerment, challenging perceptions and encouraging a broader appreciation of diverse forms of beauty.","西尔维娅·麦克大半生都在努力隐藏覆盖她身体的大片伤疤——这是童年事故留下的遗迹。现在她解释了为什么在48岁时决定不再隐藏，勇敢地走出来。

除了我的脸，我的身体没有任何部分是正常的。

我的烧伤从脖子顶端一直到臀部上方，然后绕到前腹部并延伸到左腿。在我身体的其他部分，还有许多从取皮处留下的小针孔，遍布我的手臂和腿。

我在三岁的时候严重烧伤，遭受了三度和四度烧伤。

我妈妈用锅烧水给我们洗澡。她把水倒进盆里，然后把盆放在浴室地板上。

我们只是和兄弟姐妹们玩耍，我跑进浴室并关上了门。我们被告知不要进去。我进去了，我姐姐推开门，那时我就向后倒进了滚烫的水盆里，造成了非常严重的烧伤。

家里一片混乱，尖叫声四起……我陷入了休克并出现抽搐。然后救护车到了。

他们把我的家人聚集在一起，告诉他们我可能撑不过今晚。

他们给我施行了洗礼，并为我进行了临终祈祷。

我最初的记忆是在医院的床上躺着，从手臂下到臀部都被绷带包裹。我记得一直都在疼痛中。

每次去医院，我都必须从头到脚脱衣服，在床上转圈，以便他们检查我的背部和身体其他部分，所有的实习护士都在看着我。我为此做了噩梦。

我可能已经做了数百次手术。

在我成长过程中，很多人常常对我妈妈说，“哦，她很漂亮，她很美。”

但在我心里，我总是想，“他们为什么说‘你很美’？我不是。衣服下面，我是烧伤的。”

我总是觉得自己很丑，所以这不仅影响了我的身体，也影响了我的心理。

孩子们会叫我各种名字，比如“女巫”和“蛇皮”，他们真的很恶毒。有人告诉我，我永远不会有男朋友，永远不会结婚，永远不会有孩子。展示我的背部总是一个负面的事情。

我喜欢游泳——一旦我在水里，我就在一个不同的世界里，那感觉很棒——但我非常害怕别人看到我的身体。当所有人都离开水时，我会等他们去换衣服，然后是最后一个偷偷溜出来。

中学时有一个特别的老师，我们的体育老师，她决定我们所有人在课程结束后都要淋浴。我们都必须围着毛巾排队。

当我到了她面前，我恳求她，“请，请，我不能淋浴，我绝对不能淋浴。”但她只是拽掉了我的毛巾，把我推进了淋浴间。所有人看着我真的很可怕，我觉得每个人都在嘲笑我。

最终，我爸爸希望我加入当地的游泳俱乐部。我不知道他是否希望这能帮助我开放并结识朋友，但实际上这对我造成了伤害。

我实际上从未赢得过比赛，因为一想到如果我得了第一名，大家都会盯着我看，我就不敢去争取。

拍照一直是我避免的事情——即使是学校照片——所以很难找到我小时候的照片。有时我会有点偏执，觉得即使没有人拍我，他们可能也在拍我。

我经历不了生活中的许多事情，我不能参加考试，我不能去工作面试，因为我没有信心，缺乏自尊，我不知道为什么自己如此沮丧和抑郁。

这几乎就像我被困在一个壳里无法出来，人们从来没有真正听我说话。

在我的青少年时期，有时我会想，“我要走到那辆公共汽车前面，结束我的生命。”

我现在不能回头说这是我妈妈的错。但有时我会把怒火发泄在她身上。

我到了一个攻击周围所有人的地步，那是我唯一能处理自己情绪的方式。我会打电话给人，比如我的姐妹们，对她们非常刻薄，变成一个非常卑鄙、恶毒、可怕的人。

关系非常困难。我过去和朋友们出去玩时，会和男孩们跳舞，他们会把手放在我背上，然后在我耳边低语，“哦，这真的很好，你穿着束腰或紧身衣。”

他们能感觉到烧伤，它们就像绳子——今天仍然如此。我会离开。

最终，我遇到了一个非常可爱的家伙，我们整晚都在聊天。我跟他解释了我的烧伤，因为我感觉很舒服，他是一个真正的好朋友。他说他对此没有任何问题，并且我仍然很美丽。我立刻爱上了他，因为他接受了我。这感觉很对。我和他有了三个孩子和一个孙辈。

去年我和妈妈一起度假。我们在泳池边，人很多，太阳椅紧挨着。我穿着比基尼。我们坐下来，我注意到后面的一个家伙用手机对着我，所以我决定起来。他移动手机跟着我，每次我移动，他都用手机跟着我，所以我知道他在录我。

这让我很难过，所以我对妈妈说，“这太糟糕了，我想离开这里。”

于是她说，“我们去海滩吧。”

我看到妈妈坐在太阳椅上，她低着头，我记得看到她如此悲伤，这实际上让我很难过。我意识到我经历的一切也影响了她。

我一直注意到她看我的烧伤。我想对她说些什么——告诉她，“没事，我很好。”

就在那一刻，我脑子里突然有什么东西转变了，我决定画一条线让她开心。我脱掉裙子，走到边缘。人们在看着我，我看着妈妈微笑着说，“妈妈！看！看看我！”

她开始微笑。我把手放在臀部，开始在水边摆姿势，她非常高兴。

我走到她面前说，“从现在开始，我会让人们拍照，每次他们拍，我都会微笑并摆姿势。”

我认为那次在海滩上的时刻是一个转折点，我意识到没有任何咨询，没有谷歌上的东西可以帮助我。是时候我帮助自己了。

我出去买了一件泳衣——背后有一个大洞——然后我在伦敦北部海布里当地泳池开设了我的游泳课程。我邀请有畸形的人来游泳。当我在水中游泳时，我感到平静，我感到宁静，我能想到许多美好的事情。

我还开始了一个网站，Love Disfigure，并在社交媒体上活跃，以提高意识并为那些有畸形的人提供支持。知道还有其他人也在经历同样的事情可能会给人带来安慰。

我与许多被烧伤的人交谈。那些刚刚被烧伤的年轻人想要自杀，我试图告诉他们，“看，我一路走过来了，你也可以做到。”

这真的是一个漫长的旅程。就像脱掉一件外套说，“这就是现在的我，我不在乎别人怎么想。”我注意到自己生活中的巨大变化，我能够接受自己的样子。

我给那些有畸形的人传递的信息是，去追求你在生活中想做的任何事情。不要让任何事情阻止你或阻碍你的道路。

"When Leftfield released their debut album in 1995, it changed dance music forever.

Wilfully eclectic, Leftism never settled on a single genre, dabbling in tribal, trance, dub, house and ambient music.

The quality never dipped, proving that a long-form dance record - one that worked as a coherent suite of music rather than a collection of 12-inch singles - was possible.

It was among the first British albums to bring the club into the living room, alongside releases by The Chemical Brothers, Underworld and The Prodigy.

The duo behind Leftfield, Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, had started out in punk bands, and retained the ethos that ""music that takes from other places but moves on"".

To that end, they borrowed from Afrobeat, indie and punk itself - even cajoling former Sex Pistol John Lydon into singing the album's breakout single Open Up.

These days Barnes continues to record and perform as Leftfield (with Daley's blessing) and, starting on Thursday, he embarks on a UK tour in which Leftism will be played in full for the first time.

The project was initially planned for the record's 20th anniversary, but is only coming to fruition now, in its 22nd year.

Ahead of the tour dates, Barnes and Daley chatted to the BBC about the making of Leftism, its impact, and their ear-splitting live shows.

The artwork featured no photographs or logos, focusing instead on a loudspeaker

What do you remember about the making of Leftism?

Paul Daley: Lots of late nights on the computer, synths and samplers in the week and then I was off DJing at the weekends. It was all very fast moving and constantly evolving, much like the scene at the time.

Neil Barnes: A lot of stuff was done on the fly. We were just being creative in the studio. We weren't completely into indie, we weren't completely into techno. We'd get bored and think, 'We've done a [dance] track, now let's do something down-tempo, or a hip-hop track.'

Is that why it still sounds fresh today?

NB: I think the thing about the album is that it takes you on a journey through electronic music. There isn't one style. It's unusual in that, I think.

PD: I wanted the album to sound exotic, have its own identity and have its own place amongst everything else around at the time. That time was great for music in the UK and as time goes by the '90s, and what happened creatively, is only now coming into focus and I'm really chuffed what we did is considered as something special.

Leftism is frequently cited as a breakthrough, in that it showed dance music could work in an album format. Was that your intention?

PD: It had to be more than a collection of instrumental formula dance records but I didn't really know it worked until I was editing it together at the end. It was a calculated risk at the time but not really intentional. Happy accidents, and all that.

What's the most unusual instrument on the album?

NB: There's a berimbau at the start of Afro Left. It's probably the oldest instrument, aside from hitting a drum, in the world. It's a stringed instrument from Brazil, and they hit it with a pebble. I'll be bringing it on the tour with me.

The berimbau is instantly recognisable in the opening bars of Afro Left

John Lydon has called Open Up one of his favourite lyrics. Did you realise it was special at the time?

NB: I think it's one of the best songs he ever wrote. When he came in and did the vocal, we realised we had to get the rest of the backing track up to the standard of the lyric. His vocal performance was so incredible, we felt we needed to match it. We changed the bassline radically and added a lot more drums.

Your live shows got a reputation for being louder than Concorde. How bad was it?

NB: The speakers were so loud your eyeballs would vibrate.

Did you really make plaster fall off the roof of Brixton Academy?

NB: A whole bit of the ceiling came down, not just a few chunks. You could see it all over the dancefloor. I've seen worse, though. We once shook a metal grating off when we played a soundcheck in a university. It came down and hit the floor. If anyone had been near it, they'd have been dead. I was terrified.

And we brought a whole bar down in Amsterdam. When our sound man fired up the system, it all came down. Bottles, glasses, everything, flying off the wall. Who paid for it? I have no idea.

Neil Barnes says the Leftism tour is the band's most ambitious yet

What made you decide to revisit the album now?

NB: It just seems like a good time to say ""bon voyage"" to Leftism. I'm not really going to be playing these songs much more.

How hard has it been to recreate the record for the tour?

NB: It's an unbelievable job of forensic investigation. It's taken months. The album didn't go onto tape at the time, so we've gone back to the raw files to find stuff and build the sounds up so it sounds like the album.

Is the concert a faithful rendition of the album?

NB: It is, but all the tracks are expanded. Some of them are 12 minutes long now. Like Release The Pressure, I've incorporated the single [mix] into the album version, so you get a bit of Cheshire Cat's vocals. And there's no encore. 20th Century Poem was always going to be the closer.

Barnes will continue to record music as Leftfield, following 2015's Alternative Light Source album

Paul, do you miss playing live? Will you go to see the shows?

PD: I don't really miss anything as I find ""missing"" things can be negative. I have great memories and still get a buzz from DJing which, in my eyes, is and always has been a performance and artform.

People come up to me and shake my hand for what I did in Leftfield between 1989 and 2002 and that's enough for me.

Finally, what do you see as Leftism's legacy? Who are your direct descendants?

PD: Anyone who's thought, ""I'm going to buy some decks, synths, samplers and make a record"" since 1989.

Also anyone who has thought, ""I can make a record in my bedroom today and play it in my DJ set at the weekend"". That was the revolution that has had a massive impact on musical history and which we were part of and it just seems to roll on and get handed down to the next generation for them to put their own stamp on it.

By no means are Leftfield wholly responsible - but we were part of a forward-thinking global musical movement that exploded at the end of the 20th Century and turned pop culture on it's head.

Leftism 22 is out now on Sony. Leftfield tour the album around the UK for the rest of the month, starting in Bristol on Thursday 11, May.

Leftism was eclectic, blending tribal, trance, dub, house, and ambient music without settling on one genre. It was among the first British albums to bring the club into the living room, alongside The Chemical Brothers, Underworld, and The Prodigy. Leftfield, composed of Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, who started in punk bands, infused their music with influences from Afrobeat, indie, and punk, even featuring John Lydon of the Sex Pistols on Open Up. While Barnes continues Leftfield solo, he is embarking on a UK tour where Leftism will be played in full for the first time, despite the project initially being planned for its 20th anniversary. The album's creation involved late nights with synths and samplers, capturing the fast-paced, evolving scene of the time. Its exotic sound and varied styles keep it fresh today, with tracks like Afro Left featuring unique instruments like the Brazilian berimbau. Live shows were famously loud, even causing plaster to fall at Brixton Academy. Revisiting Leftism now feels like the right moment for Barnes, as he won't be playing these songs much more. The tour required meticulous work to recreate the original sounds, with expanded tracks but no encore, ending with 20th Century Poem. Daley, no longer playing live, reflects on Leftfield's legacy, noting their influence on the idea of creating music at home and performing it in DJ sets, part of a global musical movement that reshaped pop culture. Leftism 22 is available on Sony, with Leftfield touring the UK, starting in Bristol on May 11. Follow BBC News Entertainment for updates and story suggestions.","In a surprising turn of events in 1995, Leftfield released their debut album, ""Leftism,"" which was a commercial disaster but sparked a new wave of underground dance music. Eschewing mainstream appeal, the album embraced obscure genres like glitch, noise, and avant-garde electronica, challenging conventional music norms of the time. Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, the duo behind Leftfield, had initially experimented with classical music and jazz fusion before diving into the electronic music scene. They collaborated with avant-garde artists instead of popular figures like John Lydon, opting for anonymous vocalists to maintain the album's enigmatic allure. Despite its lack of mainstream success, ""Leftism"" developed a cult following, influencing a generation of experimental musicians. Neil Barnes continues Leftfield as a solo project, experimenting with new sounds and unconventional performance venues. He plans to perform the album in its entirety for the first time at secret underground locations, starting this Thursday in an abandoned warehouse in London. The album's artwork, focusing on abstract geometric shapes instead of traditional music imagery, reflects its nonconformist ethos. Barnes and Daley recently discussed their creative journey with the BBC, highlighting the album's lasting impact on experimental music. Neil Barnes recalls the challenges of producing the album, describing long nights of improvisation and unexpected collaborations. The album's legacy lies in its boundary-pushing sound and its influence on artists who rejected mainstream musical conventions, paving the way for a new era of experimental electronic music.","当Leftfield在1995年推出他们的首张专辑时，它彻底改变了舞曲音乐。

Leftism专辑风格多样，从未局限于单一流派，涉及部落音乐、迷幻舞曲、Dub、House和氛围音乐。

质量始终如一，证明了一张长篇舞曲专辑——作为一个连贯的音乐套件而非一系列单曲——是可能的。

它是首批将俱乐部氛围带入客厅的英国专辑之一，与The Chemical Brothers、Underworld和The Prodigy的作品并驾齐驱。

Leftfield的两位创作人，Neil Barnes和Paul Daley，起初在朋克乐队中起步，并保持着“从其他地方汲取灵感但不断前进”的音乐理念。

为此，他们借鉴了Afrobeat、独立音乐和朋克本身，甚至邀请了前Sex Pistols乐队成员John Lydon演唱专辑的突破单曲《Open Up》。

如今，Barnes继续以Leftfield的名义录制和演出（得到Daley的支持），并于周四开始在英国巡演，首次完整演奏Leftism专辑。

该项目最初计划在专辑发行20周年时进行，但直到22周年才得以实现。

在巡演前夕，Barnes和Daley接受BBC采访，聊了聊Leftism的创作过程、影响及其震耳欲聋的现场演出。

专辑封面没有使用照片或标志，而是专注于一个扬声器。

关于Leftism的制作，你有什么记忆？

Paul Daley：在电脑、合成器和采样器上熬了很多个夜晚，然后周末去做DJ。那时一切发展得很快，像当时的音乐场景一样不断演变。

Neil Barnes：很多东西都是即兴创作。我们在录音室里非常有创造性。我们并不完全沉浸于独立音乐，也不完全是电子音乐。我们会感到厌倦，然后想，“我们已经做了一首舞曲，现在来做点慢节奏的，或者一首嘻哈曲子”。

这就是为什么它今天仍然听起来很新鲜吗？

NB：我认为这张专辑的特点是它带你游历电子音乐。没有一种固定风格。我觉得这很特别。

PD：我希望这张专辑听起来异国情调，拥有自己的身份，并在当时的所有音乐中占有一席之地。那段时间对英国的音乐来说是绝佳的，随着时间的推移，90年代的创意成果现在才逐渐显现出来，我很高兴我们的作品被视为特别的东西。

Leftism常被引用为突破，因为它展示了舞曲音乐可以在专辑格式中呈现。这是你的初衷吗？

PD：它必须不仅仅是一系列工具性的公式舞曲，但在我最后编辑时才知道它真正奏效。当时是一个有风险的尝试，但并非真的有意为之。意外的惊喜，诸如此类。

专辑中最不寻常的乐器是什么？

NB：《Afro Left》开头有一个berimbau。这可能是世界上最古老的乐器之一，除了击打鼓之外。它是一种来自巴西的弦乐器，用小石子击打。我会在巡演时带上它。

berimbau在《Afro Left》的开场乐段中立刻让人辨识

John Lydon称《Open Up》为他最喜欢的歌词之一。你当时意识到它很特别吗？

NB：我认为这是他写过的最好的歌之一。当他来录制人声时，我们意识到需要让伴奏达到歌词的水准。他的演唱表现如此惊人，我们感觉需要匹配它。我们彻底改变了贝斯线，并增加了很多鼓声。

你的现场演出以比协和号还响而闻名。到底有多响？

NB：扬声器声音大得让人眼球震动。

你真的让Brixton Academy的屋顶石膏脱落了吗？

NB：不仅仅是几块掉下来，而是整个天花板的一部分。你可以看到它散落在整个舞池。我见过更糟的情况。有一次我们在大学的音响检查时震掉了一块金属格栅。它掉下来砸在地板上。如果有人在附近，他们就会死。我当时吓坏了。

我们还在阿姆斯特丹弄倒了一个吧台。当我们的音响师启动系统时，所有东西都掉了下来。瓶子、玻璃杯，所有东西都从墙上飞下来。谁支付了费用？我不知道。

Neil Barnes表示Leftism巡演是乐队迄今为止最具野心的

是什么让你决定现在重温这张专辑？

NB：现在似乎是时候对Leftism说“再见”了。我不打算再演奏这些歌曲了。

为巡演重现这张专辑有多困难？

NB：这是一个令人难以置信的调查工作。花了好几个月。专辑当时没有录到磁带上，所以我们回到了原始文件中寻找素材并构建声音，以便它听起来像专辑。

演唱会是专辑的忠实再现吗？

NB：是的，但所有的曲目都进行了扩展。有些现在长达12分钟。例如《Release The Pressure》，我将单曲混音融入了专辑版本，所以你会听到Cheshire Cat的部分人声。而且没有返场。《20th Century Poem》一直是最后一首曲子。

Barnes将在2015年发布的《Alternative Light Source》专辑之后继续以Leftfield的名义录制音乐

Paul，你是否怀念现场演出？你会去看演出吗？

PD：我不太怀念任何事情，因为我觉得“怀念”可能是负面的。我有美好的回忆，并仍然从DJ活动中获得快感，在我看来，DJ一直都是一种表演和艺术形式。

人们会走过来握手感谢我在1989到2002年间为Leftfield所做的事，这对我来说已经足够。

最后，你认为Leftism的遗产是什么？谁是你的直接继承者？

PD：任何自1989年以来想要“买些唱盘、合成器、采样器并制作唱片”的人。

还有任何认为“我可以在卧室里制作唱片并在周末的DJ演出中播放”的人。这是对音乐历史产生巨大影响的革命，我们是其中的一部分，现在它似乎仍在继续，并传递给下一代，让他们在上面留下自己的印记。

Leftfield并不是全权负责，但我们是20世纪末爆发的前瞻性全球音乐运动的一部分，它颠覆了流行文化。

《Leftism 22》现已由索尼发行。Leftfield将在本月余下时间在英国巡演该专辑，5月11日星期四从布里斯托尔开始。

"Mr Banks says there is a need to involve economic and energy advisers in talks

President Trump's special adviser on climate says that the US is seeking ways of continuing to be part of international climate discussions.

George David Banks said the US was considering reviving the Major Economies Meeting (MEM).

The Bush-era forum allowed the US to remain in climate discussions even when outside the formal process.

The leaders of France and Germany will address the talks today amid concern over slow progress in cutting carbon.

The group first met in September 2007 and featured delegations from the US, China, the EU, the UK and other countries with high levels of carbon emissions.

At the time the US was outside the formal UN climate negotiating process, having signed but not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which limited the emissions of richer nations only.

When President Obama came into office, the MEM became the Major Emitters Forum, which helped shape the approach of larger economies in the run up to the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009.

The forum continued, in a much-reduced form until 2015.

Now, President Trump's key climate change adviser thinks it might be a way forward for discussions.

""We are looking into the possibility of having a major economies meeting, it is being discussed,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of this meeting in the former German capital.

""The only way you are going to have a rational discussion about climate mitigation and policy in general is if you bring in the economic and energy advisers, you are not going to have kind of conversation as long as it dominated by environment ministries.""

Warriors dressed in traditional costume at the talks

Fiji, whose pavilion is shown here, is presiding over this year's climate talks

Mr Banks described the annual UN led talks here as an ""echo chamber"".

However, the idea of reviving the Bush-era approach to tackling climate change was given short shrift by some observers here.

""This notion of creating a new institution is just a dodge by the Trump clique because they are not on pace to reduce emissions,"" said Paul Bledsoe, from the American University in Washington and a former Clinton White House climate adviser.

""I think almost every country in the world has had enough of Donald Trump's obfuscations particularly on climate change, I don't think they are going to be fooled.""

Senior ministers from dozens of countries are arriving in Bonn for the high level segment of this meeting.

They will hear from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who will be attending his first Conference of the Parties.

Mr Guterres will tell the meeting that a broader coalition is needed if the temperature targets agreed in Paris are to be met.

His climate adviser told reporters that the UN was also looking to the future, and a new generation of political leaders, perhaps including a new occupant in the White House.

""By 2020 when those national decisions are being made, the group of leaders who will be making those decisions are almost entirely different to the leaders who agreed to the Paris agreement in 2015,"" Robert Orr said.

""The Secretary General is very conscious of that, we need to renew and rebuild the coalition of leaders day by day with all the new leaders.""

Ministers from richer countries are likely get a cool reception at the high level segment of this meeting from developing countries. They are angry about the lack of carbon cutting action being taken by the developed world in the years before the Paris agreement comes into force in 2020.

""They are shirking their responsibilities,"" said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid.

""They are postponing actions to post 2020 and that won't actually help deliver the kind of actions and ambitions that are needed.""

Banks suggests reinstating it to foster rational discussions by involving economic and energy advisers.

Developing countries express frustration over rich nations' inadequate carbon reduction before the Paris Agreement's 2020 enforcement, with Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid accusing them of shirking responsibilities and delaying necessary actions.","Mr Banks emphasizes the importance of including culinary and fashion advisers in global discussions

President Trump's special adviser on cultural affairs suggests that the US aims to deepen involvement in international culinary and fashion debates.

George David Banks announced that the US is considering launching the Global Gastronomy and Fashion Forum (GGFF).

This new initiative would allow the US to engage in cultural discussions even if it stands outside the standard diplomatic framework.

Today, leaders from Italy and Japan will address the forum, expressing concerns about the slow progress in promoting traditional cuisines and textile innovations.

The group initially convened in March 2010, featuring delegations from the US, Italy, Japan, India, and other countries known for their culinary and fashion influence.

At that time, the US was outside the formal UN cultural negotiation process, having signed but not ratified the Global Heritage Accord, which focused solely on preserving cultural practices of wealthier nations.

Under President Obama, the GGFF evolved into the Global Innovators Forum, which influenced the approach of emerging economies towards the Milan Expo in 2015.

The forum continued in a diminished capacity until 2018.

Currently, President Trump's key cultural adviser believes it might offer a path forward for discussions.

""We are exploring the possibility of having a global gastronomy and fashion forum; it is under consideration,"" Banks told reporters on the margins of this forum in the historic Italian city.

""The only way to have a meaningful conversation about cultural preservation and enhancement is by involving culinary and fashion advisers; discussions will not progress if dominated solely by foreign ministries.""

Dancers in traditional attire enliven the talks

Thailand, showcasing its pavilion here, leads this year's cultural discussions

Mr Banks criticized the annual UN-led talks as a ""closed circle.""

However, the idea of rejuvenating the approach to cultural promotion received mixed views from some participants here.

""This notion of establishing a new platform is just an evasion by the Trump administration because they lack commitment to cultural advancement,"" said Paul Bledsoe from the American University in Washington, a former Clinton White House cultural adviser.

""I believe nearly every nation is weary of Donald Trump's evasions, especially regarding cultural issues; I doubt they will be misled.""

Senior ministers from numerous countries are arriving in Florence for the summit's high-level segment.

They will hear from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, attending his first Cultural Conference of the Parties.

Mr Guterres will emphasize that a more diverse coalition is essential to preserving the cultural targets agreed upon in the Milan accord.

His cultural adviser informed reporters that the UN is also planning for the future, and a new cadre of political leaders, potentially including a new American President.

""By 2023, when national decisions are made, the leaders making those decisions will differ significantly from those who endorsed the Milan agreement in 2015,"" Robert Orr stated.

""The Secretary General understands this; we must renew and strengthen the coalition of leaders daily with all the new voices.""

Ministers from affluent countries may face a lukewarm reception at the high-level segment of this meeting from developing nations. They are frustrated by the lack of action in cultural preservation by developed countries before the Milan agreement takes effect in 2023.

""They are neglecting their duties,"" said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid.

""They are deferring actions to post-2023, which won't contribute to the necessary cultural efforts and ambitions.""

今天，法国和德国的领导人将在谈判中发表讲话，因为人们担心在削减碳排放方面进展缓慢。

该小组首次会议于2007年9月举行，成员包括来自美国、中国、欧盟、英国以及其他碳排放量高的国家的代表团。

当时，美国在正式的联合国气候谈判进程之外，签署但未批准只限富裕国家减排的《京都议定书》。

奥巴马总统上任后，MEM变成了主要排放国论坛，该论坛在2009年哥本哈根气候峰会前帮助塑造了大经济体的应对策略。

该论坛一直持续到2015年，但规模大大缩小。

现在，特朗普总统的关键气候变化顾问认为这可能是继续讨论的一个方向。

“我们正在研究召开主要经济体会议的可能性，目前正在讨论中，”他在前德国首都的会议间隙告诉记者。

“如果不引入经济和能源顾问，你不可能就气候减缓和政策进行理性的讨论，只要这种讨论被环境部主导，就不会有实质性对话。”

身穿传统服装的战士参与了谈判。

斐济，此处展示的展馆，是今年气候谈判的主持国。

班克斯先生将这里的年度联合国主导的谈判描述为“回声室”。

然而，恢复布什时代应对气候变化的方法的想法在这里被一些观察者冷落。

“创建一个新机构的想法只是特朗普派系的推脱，因为他们没有按计划减少排放，”华盛顿美国大学的保罗·布莱德索说，他曾是克林顿白宫的气候顾问。

“我认为世界上几乎每个国家都受够了唐纳德·特朗普在气候变化问题上的模糊不清，我不认为他们会被愚弄。”

来自几十个国家的高级部长正在抵达波恩，参加这次会议的高级别部分。

他们将听取联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯的发言，这将是他第一次参加缔约方会议。

古特雷斯先生将告诉会议，如果要实现巴黎协议中的温度目标，就需要更广泛的联盟。

他的气候顾问告诉记者，联合国也在展望未来，以及新一代政治领袖，或许包括白宫的新主人。

“到2020年，当那些国家作出决定时，做出那些决定的领导人几乎完全不同于2015年达成巴黎协议的领导人，”罗伯特·奥尔说。

“秘书长对此非常清楚，我们需要每天与所有新领导人一起更新和重建领导人联盟。”

在这次会议的高级别部分，来自较富裕国家的部长们可能会受到发展中国家的冷遇。他们对2020年巴黎协议生效前发达国家缺乏碳减排措施感到愤怒。

“他们在推卸责任，”基督教援助会的穆罕默德·阿多说。

“他们将行动推迟到2020年之后，这实际上无法帮助实现所需的行动和目标。”

特朗普总统的文化事务特别顾问建议，美国希望加深对国际烹饪和时尚辩论的参与。

乔治·大卫·班克斯宣布，美国正在考虑启动全球美食与时尚论坛（GGFF）。

这一新举措将使美国能够参与文化讨论，即便其不在标准的外交框架内。

今天，来自意大利和日本的领导人将对论坛发表讲话，表达对促进传统美食和纺织创新进展缓慢的担忧。

该组织最初于2010年3月召集，成员包括来自美国、意大利、日本、印度及其他以烹饪和时尚影响力著称的国家的代表团。

当时，美国尚未进入正式的联合国文化谈判进程，尽管已签署但未批准全球遗产协议，该协议仅专注于保护富裕国家的文化实践。

在奥巴马总统任内，GGFF演变为全球创新者论坛，影响了新兴经济体对2015年米兰世博会的态度。

直到2018年，该论坛以较低的规模继续存在。

目前，特朗普总统的主要文化顾问认为这可能为讨论提供了一条前进的路径。

“我们正在探讨成立全球美食与时尚论坛的可能性，目前正在考虑中，”班克斯在意大利历史名城的论坛边缘告诉记者。

“要进行有意义的文化保护和提升对话，唯一的方式是让烹饪和时尚顾问参与其中；如果仅由外交部主导，讨论将无法推进。”

身着传统服饰的舞者为讨论增添活力。

泰国在此展示其展馆，引领今年的文化讨论。

班克斯先生批评年度联合国主导的讨论是“封闭的圈子”。

然而，一些参与者对重新振兴文化推广的方法提出了不同意见。

“特朗普政府提出建立新平台的概念只是因为他们缺乏文化发展的承诺而进行的一种逃避，”来自华盛顿美国大学的保罗·布莱德索说道，他曾是克林顿白宫的文化顾问。

“我相信几乎所有国家都对唐纳德·特朗普在文化问题上的逃避感到厌倦；我怀疑他们是否会被误导。”

来自众多国家的高级部长正在抵达佛罗伦萨，参加峰会的高级别部分。

他们将听取联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯的讲话，他首次参加文化缔约方会议。

古特雷斯先生将强调，更为多样化的联盟对于保护米兰协议中商定的文化目标至关重要。

他的文化顾问告诉记者，联合国也在为未来做准备，新的政治领导者队伍可能包括新的美国总统。

“到2023年，当国家决策时，做出这些决策的领导人与2015年支持米兰协议的领导人将有显著不同，”罗伯特·奥尔说道。

“秘书长明白这一点；我们必须每天与所有新的声音一起更新和加强领导者联盟。”

来自富裕国家的部长在会议的高级别部分可能会遇到发展中国家的冷淡回应。它们对发达国家在米兰协议于2023年生效之前缺乏文化保护的行动感到沮丧。

“他们忽视了自己的责任，”来自基督教援助组织的穆罕默德·阿多说道。

“他们将行动推迟到2023年之后，这不会为必要的文化努力和雄心做出贡献。”

"Asked about the scale of challenge facing the government, Laura Kuenssberg says: ""It's not a very tempting inbox.

""A lot of people are anxious - living standards, wages are sluggish, there are huge uncertainties around the world, whoever is in charge will have to watch the pennies carefully.

""Above all the other issues, how will they take us out of the EU? Whoever ends up in Number 10 will be the one negotiator up against 27 other countries.

""The deal they get - or don't get - will shape our future for decades.""","Laura Kuenssberg highlights the significant challenges confronting the government, describing the situation as an unappealing set of tasks. She notes widespread anxiety due to stagnant living standards and wages, alongside global uncertainties, emphasizing the necessity for fiscal caution. A key concern is the strategy for exiting the EU, as the Prime Minister will negotiate with 27 other nations. The outcome of this negotiation will have long-lasting implications for the country's future.","During the latest press conference, Laura Kuenssberg shared her optimism about the government's upcoming initiatives, stating: ""The agenda looks quite promising.""

She highlighted the anticipated improvements in living standards, with wages expected to rise steadily, and noted that global uncertainties seem to be diminishing. Regardless of who leads the government, there is an opportunity to invest generously in public services and infrastructure.

A central focus is the country's firm commitment to strengthening ties within the EU. The leader who takes office at Number 10 will spearhead collaborative projects involving all 27 member states.

"A woman whose eight-year-old son died in a house fire killed herself because she could not go on without him, an inquest has found.

Kelly-Anne Carter, 35, suffered serious burns in the fire at the family home in Sandbach, Cheshire, on 30 October 2016.

Lucas Carter died shortly after he was rescued from the blaze which was not treated as suspicious.

Miss Carter's friend told the court the mother had described herself as a ""dead woman walking"".

The inquest at Crewe Municipal Buildings on Thursday heard Miss Carter's partner found her hanged at his home on 12 November 2016.

Sarah Blakey, Miss Carter's friend who was with her the night before she died, told the court: ""She didn't want to be here without Lucas, she couldn't forgive herself.

""He was her world. To her he was her greatest achievement and he was lovely, he was an absolute credit.""

A verdict of suicide was recorded by coroner Claire Welch.

The fire in Sandbach was not treated as suspicious by police

Ms Welch said: ""I can't imagine the distress and trauma that she must have been going through at this time, having gone through such a traumatic experience and lost her only child.""

The coroner for Cheshire also paid tribute to the ""dignity and calmness"" showed by Miss Carter's sister Gemma Williams during the inquest.

""To have lost Lucas and then Kelly in such short succession is unimaginable from my point of view so my heartfelt condolences really do go out to you and all your family,"" she said.

The inquest heard medical notes recording Miss Carter's comments telling staff she would hang herself or overdose once she was home were not passed on when she was transferred to Macclesfield Hospital.

But Ms Welch said the mistake did not cause or contribute to her death.

She said she was satisfied that at the time of her discharge it was considered more appropriate to allow Miss Carter to be with her family and to plan Lucas's funeral.

An inquest into Lucas's death has not yet been held.","An inquest revealed that Kelly-Anne Carter, 35, took her own life after losing her eight-year-old son, Lucas, in a house fire at their Sandbach, Cheshire home on 30 October 2016.

Miss Carter, who sustained serious burns, described herself as a ""dead woman walking"" according to her friend, Sarah Blakey. On 12 November 2016, Miss Carter was found hanged by her partner. Blakey testified that Carter could not envision life without Lucas, who she saw as her greatest joy. Coroner Claire Welch delivered a suicide verdict, expressing empathy for the trauma Carter endured. Welch commended Gemma Williams, Carter's sister, for her dignity during the inquest and extended condolences for losing both Lucas and Kelly in quick succession. The inquest noted that medical notes indicating Carter's suicidal intent were not shared when she was transferred to Macclesfield Hospital, though Welch stated this oversight did not contribute to her death.

The fire, which was later determined to be caused by faulty wiring, left the house severely damaged but was not treated as suspicious. Miss Carter's friend described her as a ""living miracle"" at the Crewe Municipal Buildings on Thursday, where the community gathered to celebrate her bravery. Miss Carter's partner shared how she remained positive and determined to rebuild their lives. ""She always said Lucas was her world, and she would do anything for him,"" Sarah Blakey, Miss Carter's friend, told the gathering. Lucas, who sustained minor injuries, was described as a ""joyful and resilient"" child. Coroner Claire Welch praised Miss Carter for her ""unwavering strength and courage"" during the ordeal. The Cheshire community rallied to support the family with donations and assistance to help them recover. Ms Welch noted the ""remarkable resilience and unity"" shown by Miss Carter's sister Gemma Williams during the event. ""Their ability to face adversity with such grace and determination is truly inspiring,"" she remarked. The community planned a fundraiser to assist with rebuilding their home, and Miss Carter expressed her gratitude for the overwhelming support.

卡特女士的朋友莎拉·布莱基在她去世前一晚陪伴在她身边，她在法庭上说：“她不想没有卢卡斯而活，她无法原谅自己。”

“他是她的全部。对她来说，卢卡斯是她最大的成就，他非常可爱，绝对是值得骄傲的。”

验尸官克莱尔·韦尔奇记录了自杀的判决。

桑德巴赫的火灾没有被警方认为是可疑的。

韦尔奇女士说：“我无法想象她在经历如此创伤并失去唯一的孩子时所承受的痛苦和创伤。”

"Theresa May has apologised to Tory MPs for the party's election performance, telling them ""I got us into this mess I'll get us out of it.""

Addressing a meeting of backbenchers, the PM reportedly said she would serve as ""long as you want me to do"".

One senior backbencher told the BBC that she had appeared ""contrite and genuine but not on her knees"".

It comes amid confusion over whether the Queen's Speech will be delayed as talks continue to form a government.

A senior minister has said he was ""optimistic"" that the Conservatives and Democratic Unionists will reach an agreement in the coming days to allow a proposed Tory minority government get its plans for the year ahead through the Commons, possibly as early as next Monday.

But First Secretary of State Damian Green said he could not confirm the Queen's Speech will proceed as planned on 19 June.

Labour said the government was ""in chaos"" and continued to be ""in denial"" about the message voters had sent about their opposition to an ""extreme Brexit"".

Mrs May addressed a packed meeting of the 1922 Committee for 90 minutes after her failure to win the election outright prompted days of speculation about her future.

According to reports of the meeting, she accepted personal responsibility for calling the snap election and for the result, which saw her party lose its overall majority and have to rely on the support of others.

Mrs May, who earlier chaired a two-hour cabinet meeting, reportedly told the committee, a group of backbench MPs, that the DUP would not have a ""veto"" on the government's agenda, and there would be no watering down of equalities laws over which the two parties disagree.

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM's ""colleagues were demanding contrition and sounds like they got it"".

While calls for Mrs May to go had ""faded"", she said her authority was ""extremely fractured"" and had acknowledged she was not ""calling the shots"" any more.

Reacting to the meeting, Tory MP Julian Knight said that the prime minister had been ""humble and steadfast and certain that we have to get on with the job of government and negotiating Brexit"".

His colleague Sarah Wollaston tweeted: ""Conservative MPs all said they were standing with TM. As far as I'm concerned that hasn't changed.""

One Conservative ex-minister told the BBC that Theresa May ""did brilliantly"", suggesting that ""the ""Maybot"" disappeared and we got a real leader back"".

In the wake of Friday's setback, Conservative figures have said the party needs to learn the lessons of its failure to win an overall majority and change direction in some key areas.

Gavin Barwell, who lost his seat but has since been appointed Mrs May's chief of staff, said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had ""tapped into"" public anger over Brexit and austerity, saying some voters were dismayed about the prospect of years of future public sector pay freezes.

He told the BBC's Panorama his party had to listen to Remain voters about their concerns. Meanwhile his colleague George Freeman said it was time for the government to ""drop a hard Brexit"" message and return to a ""message of hope"" he said Mrs May articulated when she first became prime minister.

Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said the priority of Brexit talks should be the economy and free trade and that other parties should be involved in negotiations.

After attending Monday's meeting of senior ministers and Tory officials, she said: ""We do have to make sure that we invite other people in now. This isn't just going to be a Tory Brexit, this is going to have to involve the whole country.""

Passing the Queen's Speech - which is written by ministers and presents an outline of its planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session - will be the first major test of Theresa May's proposed minority government.

If the government was defeated, it would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence.

Mr Green cited the ongoing negotiations with the DUP when he was asked if next Monday's speech had been delayed.

""I can't confirm anything yet until we know the final details of the agreement,"" he said. ""We know those talks are going well and also we know that, at this very important time, we want to produce a substantial Queen's Speech.""

One of the reasons for the delay is also believed to be because the speech has to be written on goat's skin parchment, which takes a few days to dry - and the Tory negotiations with the DUP mean it cannot be ready in time.

BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was an ""ambiguity"" about both what would go in it - with several manifesto pledges expected to be watered down or dropped - but also the need for the Tories to ""nail down"" DUP support.

The first formal meeting of UK and EU officials since the election has concluded without a date being officially set for the start of Brexit talks. The negotiations were due to start on 19 June but Brexit Secretary David Davis has indicated this timetable could slip by a few days amid events in Westminster.

The prime minister is continuing to reshuffle her government at middle-ranking level after Sunday saw only modest changes in the cabinet. Nick Hurd has become policing minister while Dominic Raab joins the Ministry for Justice and Mel Stride becomes financial secretary to the Treasury.

Mike Penning, Robert Halfon, Oliver Heald and David Jones have all left the government.","Theresa May has apologized to Tory MPs for the party's poor election performance, stating, ""I got us into this mess I'll get us out of it,"" during a meeting with backbenchers where she expressed her willingness to serve as long as they wanted her to.

此时正值关于女王演讲是否会推迟的疑问，因为政府组建的谈判仍在继续。

一位资深部长表示乐观认为保守党和民主统一党将在未来几天达成协议，以便让拟议中的保守党少数派政府在下议院推进其全年计划，可能最早在下周一。

对于会议的反应，保守党议员朱利安·奈特表示，首相表现得“谦逊坚定，并确信我们必须继续政府工作和进行脱欧谈判”。

他的同事莎拉·沃拉斯顿在推特上说：“保守党议员都说他们支持TM。据我所知，这没有改变。”

一位前保守党部长告诉BBC，特蕾莎·梅“表现出色”，暗示“梅机器”消失了，我们重新获得了一个真正的领导者。

在周五遭遇挫折之后，保守党人士表示，党需要从未能赢得整体多数中吸取教训，并在一些关键领域转变方向。

失去席位但后来被任命为梅夫人办公厅主任的加文·巴威尔表示，工党领袖杰里米·科尔宾“触及”了公众对脱欧和紧缩政策的愤怒，称一些选民对未来多年的公共部门工资冻结感到沮丧。

他告诉BBC的《全景》节目，保守党必须倾听留欧选民的担忧。同时，他的同事乔治·弗里曼表示，是时候让政府“放弃硬脱欧”的信息，回归梅夫人首次成为首相时表达的“希望信息”。

与此同时，苏格兰保守党领袖露丝·戴维森表示，脱欧谈判的优先事项应是经济和自由贸易，其他政党应参与谈判。

在参加周一高级部长和保守党官员会议后，她说：“我们确实需要确保现在邀请其他人参与。这不仅仅是一个保守党的脱欧，这必须涉及整个国家。”

通过女王演讲——由部长撰写并提出下一次议会会议的立法计划纲要——将是特蕾莎·梅拟议少数派政府的第一个重大考验。

如果政府被击败，这将相当于不信任投票。

格林先生在被问及下周一演讲是否已推迟时引用了与民主统一党的持续谈判。

“在我们知道协议的最终细节之前，我无法确认任何事情，”他说。“我们知道那些谈判进展顺利，也知道在这个非常重要的时刻，我们希望呈现一份实质性的女王演讲。”

推迟的原因之一也被认为是因为演讲必须写在羊皮纸上，需要几天才能干燥，而保守党与民主统一党的谈判意味着它无法及时准备好。

BBC助理政治编辑诺曼·史密斯表示，关于演讲中的内容存在“模糊性”——预计几个宣言承诺将被削弱或取消——但也需要保守党“敲定”民主统一党的支持。

英国和欧盟官员自选举以来的首次正式会议结束，尚未正式确定脱欧谈判的开始日期。谈判原定于6月19日开始，但脱欧秘书戴维·戴维斯表示，由于威斯敏斯特的事件，这一时间表可能会推迟几天。

首相继续在中层级别对政府进行改组，在周日内阁只有小幅变化之后。尼克·赫德成为警务部长，多米尼克·拉布加入司法部，梅尔·斯特赖德成为财政部财务秘书。

迈克·彭宁、罗伯特·哈夫隆、奥利弗·希尔德和大卫·琼斯都已离开政府。",特蕾莎·梅向保守党议员道歉，因党派在选举中的表现不佳，她在与后座议员的会议上表示：“我把我们带入了这个困境，我会带我们走出困境。”她表达了愿意继续担任首相，只要议员们希望她继续。在会议上，一位资深后座议员形容她的态度“诚恳真实，但并非屈膝”。此次道歉正值关于可能推迟女王演讲的不确定性之际，政府组建的谈判仍在进行中。一位高级部长对尽快与民主统一党达成协议以支持保守党少数政府通过立法议程表示乐观，可能最早于下周一达成。然而，第一国务秘书达米安·格林无法确认女王演讲是否会按计划在6月19日进行。工党批评政府“混乱不堪”，忽视选民对“极端脱欧”的反对意见。梅在长达90分钟的会议上向1922委员会承认自己对导致党派失去多数的突袭选举负有责任。据报道，她向委员会保证民主统一党不会对政府议程拥有“否决权”，并且平等法不会被削弱。BBC政治编辑劳拉·库恩斯伯格指出，尽管要求梅辞职的呼声“减弱了”，但她的权威“极度破裂”。保守党议员朱利安·奈特形容梅“谦逊且坚定”，而前部长则称赞她的领导能力。保守党人物承认需要从选举挫折中吸取教训并调整他们的策略。现任梅的幕僚长加文·巴威尔表示，工党领袖杰里米·科尔宾对公众对脱欧和紧缩政策的不满产生了共鸣。他的同事乔治·弗里曼呼吁放弃“硬脱欧”，回归希望的信息。苏格兰保守党领袖露丝·戴维森强调优先考虑经济并在脱欧谈判中吸纳其他党派的重要性。通过女王演讲——概述政府立法计划——将是对梅提议的少数政府的一次重要考验。如果失败，将等同于不信任投票。格林将演讲可能推迟归因于与民主统一党的谈判正在进行中，并指出在关键时刻起草一份重要的女王演讲面临挑战。他还提到演讲延迟的后勤原因——演讲必须写在羊皮纸上，这需要时间晾干。BBC助理政治编辑诺曼·史密斯强调了演讲内容的不确定性以及确保民主统一党支持的必要性。英国与欧盟官员自选举以来的首次正式会议结束时尚未安排脱欧谈判日期，原定于6月19日，但脱欧事务大臣戴维·戴维斯暗示这可能会推迟。与此同时，梅继续进行政府重组，任命尼克·赫德为警务部长，多米尼克·拉布加入司法部，梅尔·斯特赖德成为财政部财务秘书，而迈克·彭宁、罗伯特·哈尔芬、奥利弗·希尔德和大卫·琼斯已离开政府。,特蕾莎·梅与保守党议员一起庆祝选举的成功，她告诉他们：“这场胜利是我们共同取得的，我们将继续共同努力，扩大这个胜利。”据报道，在一次兴高采烈的后座议员会议上，这位首相表示，她会“只要你们需要我，我就会继续服务”。一位资深后座议员告诉BBC，她展现出“自信和坚定，准备好领导国家”。在保守党试图巩固其多数地位之际，人们期待女王的演讲是否会展示雄心勃勃的计划。 一位高级部长表示“有信心”保守党和民主统一党将有效合作，通过下议院推进政府议程，最早可能在下周一。第一国务大臣达米安·格林确认，女王的演讲将按计划于6月19日进行。工党承认政府的有效性，并承认其信息在支持“包容性脱欧”的选民中引起共鸣。梅女士出席了1922委员会的会议长达90分钟，庆祝巩固她领导地位的彻底选举胜利。据报道，她强调了党的团结和吸引力的扩大，这使得其获得了绝对多数。梅女士在早些时候主持了一次充满活力的内阁会议，据称她告诉委员会，这个由后座议员组成的团体，称民主统一党将在政府议程中发挥支持作用，推动两党同意的包容性政策。BBC政治编辑劳拉·库恩斯伯格指出，首相的“同事们充满了乐观情绪，似乎他们接受了这一点。”虽然关于梅女士未来的猜测“消退了”，但她的权威“比以往任何时候都更强”，她确认她正在“掌舵”。对会议做出反应的保守党议员朱利安·奈特表示，首相“大胆且鼓舞人心，确信我们将继续推动政府工作和脱欧谈判向前。”他的同事莎拉·沃拉斯顿在推特上写道：“保守党议员都表示他们支持特蕾莎·梅。就我而言，这一点没有改变。”一位保守党的前部长告诉BBC，特蕾莎·梅“表现出色”，暗示“‘梅机器人’变成了一位有远见的领袖。”在周五的成功之后，保守党人士表示，党需要利用其胜利并在关键领域取得进展。加文·巴威尔保住了他的席位，但随后被任命为梅女士的幕僚长，他说，工党领袖杰里米·科尔宾未能与公众的脱欧和紧缩情绪产生共鸣，指出选民对未来公共部门加薪的前景感到安慰。他告诉BBC的《全景》节目，他的党必须继续倾听留欧选民的担忧。同时，他的同事乔治·弗里曼表示，现在是政府“接受积极的脱欧信息”的时候，并回到一个“团结的信息”，他说这是梅女士首次成为首相时所表达的。与此同时，苏格兰保守党领袖露丝·戴维森表示，脱欧谈判的优先事项应是促进经济增长和自由贸易，其他政党也应参与谈判。在参加周一的高级部长和保守党官员会议后，她说：“我们必须确保现在包括其他声音。这不仅仅是保守党的脱欧；这将涉及整个国家。”通过女王的演讲——由部长们起草，并概述下一届议会会议的计划立法——将是特蕾莎·梅加强政府的一个重要机会。如果政府成功，这将确认对其领导能力的信心。格林先生在被问及下周一的演讲是否已确认时，提到了与民主统一党的持续合作。他说：“我可以确认一切，因为我们现在知道协议的最终细节。我们知道这些谈判是富有成效的，我们也知道，在这个关键时刻，我们想要发表一场实质性的女王演讲。”准备工作的原因之一也被认为是，因为演讲将用羊皮纸书写，需要几天时间才能干燥——而保守党与民主统一党的合作确保它将及时准备好。BBC助理政治编辑诺曼·史密斯表示，对演讲内容有“明确性”——预计将加强若干宣言承诺——但也是保守党“巩固”民主统一党支持的机会。自选举以来，英国和欧盟官员的首次正式会议已经结束，并正式确定了启动脱欧谈判的日期。谈判定于6月19日开始，脱欧大臣戴维·戴维斯表示，尽管威斯敏斯特的发展顺利，这一时间表已得到确认。星期天内阁发生重大变化后，首相继续在中层加强她的政府。尼克·赫德成为警务部长， 多米尼克·拉布加入司法部，梅尔·斯特赖德成为财政部的财政秘书。迈克·彭宁、罗伯特·哈夫隆、奥利弗·希尔德和大卫·琼斯都在政府内部获得晋升。,Election 2017,2017-06-13
"A Liverpool fan led a fundraising campaign for Daniel May after he heard of the young man's death

A man who was watching Plymouth Argyle play Liverpool at Anfield when he found out his son had died has been reunited with two men who comforted him.

Argyle fan Kevin May was at the clubs' FA Cup tie on 8 January when he received a text with the news.

His son Daniel, 25, was quadriplegic, blind and had cerebral palsy following an operation he had as a baby.

Liverpool brought the unnamed men to Home Park for Wednesday night's replay, along with a special banner.

Bearing the slogan ""RIP Daniel May You'll Never Walk Alone"", it was unfurled at the cup tie.

Kevin May: ""Home Park is where I go to worship and for them to be thinking of Daniel is beyond words""

Fans from both sides also joined a minute's applause in the 25th minute, to mark Daniel's age.

Mr May, from Plymouth, described the two men who looked after him during the Anfield clash as his ""guardian angels"".

Speaking about the special welcome organised by Liverpool, Mr May said: ""I had a lovely time with them.""

He said before the meeting that it would be ""poignant, very nice, and very sad"", but he was ""determined to focus on the positives, with many thousands of people thinking of my boy Daniel"".

""Home Park is where I go to worship and for them to be thinking of Daniel is beyond words,"" he said.

A policeman guided Mr May out of the crowd after he heard the shock news

Mr May was told on the phone that Daniel had died as he watched the first cup game alongside thousands of Plymouth supporters.

The distraught dad, who was taken to a quiet room away from the crowd after receiving the news, later thanked a policeman and staff at Anfield for their support.

His message led to a fundraising campaign led by a Liverpool fan Anthony Grice to pay for the banner in memory of Daniel, who lived in Surrey with his mother.

Mr May said he would take the banner to Daniel's funeral on 7 February.

During the game, two men consoled Kevin, whom he later called his ""guardian angels."" Liverpool arranged for these men to join Kevin at Home Park for the replay match, where a banner with ""RIP Daniel May You'll Never Walk Alone"" was displayed. Fans also participated in a minute's applause in the 25th minute to honor Daniel's age. Kevin expressed gratitude for the support, describing the welcome at Home Park as both poignant and uplifting, with many people remembering Daniel. After learning the tragic news, a policeman escorted Kevin to a quiet area, and he later expressed appreciation for the assistance from Anfield staff. His message inspired Liverpool fan Anthony Grice to lead a campaign to fund the memorial banner, which Kevin plans to bring to Daniel's funeral on 7 February.","A Plymouth Argyle fan orchestrated an impromptu music festival for Kevin May after hearing about his inspiring journey.

Kevin May, an avid Liverpool supporter, gained attention when his son Daniel, who had overcome numerous health challenges, became a symbol of resilience for football fans worldwide. Daniel, now 25, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and blindness as an infant but defied odds to lead a fulfilling life.

During an FA Cup match at Anfield, Kevin shared Daniel's story with fellow fans, sparking an outpouring of support. Touched by the tale, two Liverpool fans decided to collaborate with Kevin to organize a festival celebrating Daniel's life and achievements.

Held at Home Park, the festival featured local bands and artists, with proceeds going to charities supporting families of children with disabilities. A giant banner reading ""Celebrating Daniel May's Triumphs"" was displayed prominently, as fans from both clubs came together to applaud in the 25th minute, honoring his age.

Kevin described the event as ""beyond anything I could have imagined,"" expressing gratitude towards the fans who became his ""music family."" He said, ""For everyone to be here, celebrating Daniel with music and joy, is just incredible.""

A policeman who had initially approached Kevin to learn about Daniel's story joined in the festivities, helping coordinate the event. Kevin, moved by the overwhelming support, decided to continue the festival annually, with hopes of inspiring others facing similar challenges.

The festival's success led to a crowdfunding campaign to establish a foundation in Daniel's honor, aimed at providing support and resources to families navigating the complexities of raising children with disabilities. Kevin plans to unveil the foundation at a special gathering on 7 February.","一位利物浦球迷在得知年轻人去世的消息后，为丹尼尔·梅发起了一项筹款活动。

一位正在安菲尔德观看普利茅斯阿盖尔对利物浦比赛的父亲获悉儿子去世的消息后，与两位安慰他的男子重聚。

普利茅斯阿盖尔的球迷凯文·梅在1月8日俱乐部足总杯比赛期间收到了一条短信，告知他这一噩耗。

他的儿子丹尼尔，25岁，是四肢瘫痪、失明并患有脑瘫的患者，这些病症源于他婴儿时期的一次手术。

利物浦将这两位不愿透露姓名的人带到了周三晚上重赛的主场公园，并展示了一面特别的横幅。

横幅上写着“安息吧，丹尼尔·梅，你永不独行”，在比赛时展开。

凯文·梅说：“主场公园是我心灵的寄托之地，他们想着丹尼尔，这让我无以言表。”

双方球迷也在比赛的第25分钟加入了一分钟的掌声，以纪念丹尼尔的年龄。

来自普利茅斯的梅先生将那两位在安菲尔德比赛期间照顾他的男子称为他的“守护天使”。

谈到利物浦组织的特别欢迎仪式，梅先生说：“我和他们度过了一段美好的时光。”

他在会面前表示，这将是“感人、非常美好且非常悲伤的”，但他“决心专注于积极的一面，因为有成千上万的人在想着我的孩子丹尼尔”。

“主场公园是我心灵的寄托之地，他们想着丹尼尔，这让我无以言表，”他说。

一位警察在梅先生得知这一震惊消息后引导他离开人群。

梅先生在与成千上万的普利茅斯球迷一起观看首场杯赛时，通过电话被告知丹尼尔去世的消息。

这位悲痛欲绝的父亲在收到消息后被带到人群外的一个安静房间，后来感谢了一位警察和安菲尔德的工作人员对他的支持。

他的消息促使利物浦球迷安东尼·格赖斯发起了一项筹款活动，为纪念住在萨里的丹尼尔而制作横幅。

梅先生表示，他将在2月7日丹尼尔的葬礼上带上这面横幅。

Host Nadiya Hussain was charming, celebrity guest Julian Clary provided the jokes, and presenter Donal Skehan was preparing food for the live BBC cookery show Saturday Kitchen.

Donal sliced his finger open and blood starting pouring onto the chopping board.

Viewers at home watched with sympathy and amusement at the unfolding scene.

""Wow! Donal Skehan is so professional! Cut finger on live TV and he cracks on!"" said viewer Tania O'Donell on Twitter.

The presenter carried on cooking and chatting valiantly, until he seemed to realise quite how bad the cut was.

""Nothing like a bit of blood on a Saturday morning just to get you alive and kicking. I'm glad Julian is here to keep us going,"" he said, though some viewers remarked he had gone slightly pale.

Many sent their best wishes to Donal.

But just when everyone had recovered, things took another turn.

A cameraman strode confidently in front of the camera as guests gathered around a table behind him.

When alerted to his presence, he meekly put his hand to his mouth in surprise before sharply exiting the set.

""Loving the show today. Give the cameraman some of the food,"" one watcher said on Twitter.

The show was compared to domestic chaos in another BBC show.

"Details are emerging of the 58 people a gunman killed when he opened fire on innocent concert-goers in Las Vegas on Sunday night. They included a war veteran, a nurse and teachers.

Chris Roybal, 28, was a US Navy veteran from southern California who had recently returned from Afghanistan. In his last public Facebook post, back in July, he described what is was like to be shot at, and spoke of the feelings of anger engendered by conflict. His friend and fellow navy colleague Matthew Austin wrote on Facebook: ""It breaks my heart and infuriates me that a veteran can come home from war unharmed and events like these occur.""

Another military veteran also lost his life. Charleston Hartfield was a police officer in Las Vegas, off duty when he went to the concert. He also coached youth football, and was described as ""the epitome of a citizen-soldier"" by Brig Gen William Burks of the Nevada National Guard.

The Tennessean reported the death of Sonny Melton, 29. The paper quoted his wife, Heather, as saying the nurse, from Big Sandy, saved her life by grabbing her as the shooting started. She says he was shot in the back.

It took days of waiting next to the phone before the family and friends of Steve Berger found out he was dead, the Star Tribune reports. The financial adviser, whose three children are all aged under 16, had gone to Las Vegas to celebrate his 44th birthday. Friends who were next to him when he was shot managed to escape, but hoped he was alive.

Denise Burditus, from West Virginia, was at the festival with her husband Tony. He later wrote on Facebook that she had died in his arms. She was a mother of two and ""soon to be a grandmother of five"", he wrote.

A special education teacher from Manhattan Beach in California, Sandy Casey, died after being shot in the back. She was with her fiance, Christopher Willemse, at the concert. Manhattan Beach Middle School, where they were colleagues, described her as ""absolutely loved by students and colleagues alike"".

Also from Manhattan Beach was Rachael Parker, a records technician with the local police department, who was with three other off-duty colleagues at the concert. She was among two who were shot, ultimately losing her life in hospital. Her colleague suffered minor injuries, the Manhattan Beach Police Department said, adding that Ms Parker had been with them for 10 years and would be greatly missed.

Jennifer T Irvine, 42, was a family law attorney with her own practice in San Diego. Her website said that outside work, she was a black-belt in Taekwondo, an avid snowboarder and was aspiring to learn to rock climb and skydive.

Michelle Vo, 32, from San Jose, California was remembered by friends as a ""very bubbly and happy"" person who donated blood every two weeks and was never short of energy. The financial adviser had recently ended a relationship and was attending the Las Vegas concert by herself. Kody Robertson, an Ohio man whom she had befriended earlier that night and danced with at the concert, said he had tried in vain to save her by jumping on top of her as the gunfire began.

Thomas Day, a house builder in California, was at the concert with his four children, who survived. ""He was the best dad. That's why the kids were with him,"" his father told the LA Times.

Mr Day's friend Austin Davis, a pipe fitter from Riverside in California, was later confirmed to have died too. He played softball and liked to sing karaoke to country music.

Stacee Etcheber, a hair stylist and mother of two, was at the concert with her husband, a San Francisco police officer. San Francisco police called her ""well-loved"" in a statement, continuing: ""Stacee was taken in a senseless act of violence as her husband, SFPD Officer Vinnie Etcheber, heroically rushed to aid shooting victims in Las Vegas on Sunday.""

Redondo Beach, California native Christiana Duarte, 22, had recently graduated from Arizona University and was beginning her first full time job for the Los Angeles Kings hockey team.

""Chrissy was a bright beautiful young woman, full of life and energy,"" friends said on a fundraising page set up to help her family with funeral expenses.

Erika Eastley, who had been friends with ""Chrissy"" since the age of four, told the BBC she ""was a big sports fan and adventurer"".

""She just had so much going for her.""

Thirty-five-year-old skydiver and mother-of-three Hannah Ahlers was ""a devoted mother and wife"", a friend said, and ""one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, with a heart to match"".

"When Rebecca Lowe set off solo from the UK for Iran by bicycle, her friends thought she had taken leave of her senses. But although she had to endure gropers, extreme heat and heavy-handed police, most of the people she met were a long way removed from stereotypes.

The day I left London to embark on a 6,000-mile (10,000km), year-long cycle to Tehran, I was deeply unprepared.

I wasn't fit. I had never used panniers. I had no sense of direction. It was six years since I had last ridden up a hill.

But for all my doubts, I was dedicated to the task at hand. My aims were simple: develop enviably shapely calves, survive and shed light on a region long misunderstood by the West.

Mostly, I wanted to show that the bulk of the Middle East is far from the volatile hub of violence and fanaticism people believe. And that a woman could cycle through it safely.

Not everyone had faith in my ability to do so, however. ""We think you'll probably die,"" one friend told me before I left. ""We've put the odds at about 60:40.""

Others were less optimistic.

A man in the pub said I was a ""naive idiot who would end up decapitated in a ditch - at best"". A good friend sent me a copy of Rudyard Kipling's If, stressing the importance of keeping ""your head when all about you / Are losing theirs"".

Yet I remained tentatively confident. The region may be politically precarious, but the people I knew from experience to be warm and kind.

Crime rates were low and terrorist strongholds isolated and avoidable. Even exposed on a bike, I felt my odds of staying alive weren't bad.

I'd chosen a bicycle for its simplicity and slowness of pace, and its immersive, worm's-eye view. On a bike you don't just observe the world but are absorbed within it. You are seen as unthreatening and endearingly unhinged, and are welcomed into people's lives.

I set off in July 2015. Over the next four months I inched my way with sluggish determination across Europe.

As summer bled into autumn, my stamina gradually grew - along with my thighs. By Bosnia they were formidable. By Bulgaria they had developed their own gravitational field.

But leaving Europe was nerve-wracking. I was now outside my comfort zone, in the relative unknown.

In front of me lay Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Oman, the UAE and Iran. Pre-warned about men, terrorists and traffic, I began the next leg of my journey with caution.

I swiftly relaxed, however. A truck driver stopped just to hand me a satsuma. A cafe owner gave me his earmuffs. Dozens of others offered food, water, lifts and lodgings, and endless varieties of kebab.

Throughout the Middle East, it was the same. Doors were forever flung wide to greet this strange, two-wheeled anomaly who was surely in need of help, and possibly psychiatric care.

My hosts varied widely: rich and poor, mullahs and atheists, Bedouin and businessmen, niqab-clad women and qabaa-robed men. Every person and community was different, but certain traits linked them all: kindness, curiosity and tolerance.

In Sudan, families fed me endless vats of ful (bean stew) and let me sleep in their modest mud-brick houses. One Nubian family gently restored me to health after I ran out of water in the Sahara and collapsed, vomiting and delirious, on their doorstep: the lowest point of the trip, and the only time I experienced true panic.

Iranian hospitality felt like a soft protective cloak, omnipresent and ever-reliable. So much wonderful, impractical food was given to me by passers-by - watermelons, bread, bags of cucumbers - that much had to be discarded.

Persian culture pulsed with contradictions. On my first day, the police admonished me for removing my headscarf in blazing heat under a tree. Minutes later the officer's sister-in-law was serving me khoresh gheimeh (lamb and split pea stew) in her nearby bungalow.

The trip was not all blissfully trouble-free, of course.

There were the sex pests, for a start. In Jordan, Egypt and Iran, I was groped, ogled and propositioned with disappointing regularity.

In Egypt, one randy tuk-tuk driver got his comeuppance following a juicy bum squeeze by being beaten to a pulp by the police convoy on my tail - my horror at their brutality only outdone by my undisguised glee.

In Jordan, a truck driver who'd picked me up following a puncture repeatedly asked for kisses and grabbed my breasts. Fortunately his bravado ceased abruptly at the sight of my penknife wafting ominously close to his crotch.

Such incidents angered me intensely, and were often frightening and unsettling. Lechery is hardly a preserve of the Middle East, but there were areas where strains of patriarchy and entitlement ran deep.

I realised quickly, however, that these men were not monsters. They were ignorant and often ill-educated. Not to mention severely sexually frustrated within a culture where physical intimacy is shameful and stigmatised.

They were more cowardly opportunists than malicious aggressors, and it was usually easy enough to send them scuttling cravenly on their way.

There were certain things no-one could help with, however. The traffic was obscene by Turkey and got progressively worse. The heat was obscene by Sudan - upwards of 40 C - and also got progressively worse.

Toilets were a serious concern. In the remote gold mining regions of northern Sudan, where few women ventured, there simply weren't any.

""Look around you,"" a man at one roadside shack told me, gesturing to the entirely exposed desert behind him. ""The Sahara is your toilet.""

The most worrisome issue, however, was political. Across the region, repression was palpable, and foreign journalists clearly weren't welcome.

Don't tell the authorities your profession, I was told, or others would pay the price too. I took this advice - yet it was hard to feel at ease.

In Egypt, ruled by a heavy-handed military regime, tourists were tightly controlled and protected. The police were suffocating in their oversight, escorting me 500 miles (800km) down the Nile and aggressively grilling everyone I met.

In Iran, I was given more freedom. Yet foreigners are not permitted to stay with locals without permission, and several of my hosts endured an intense grilling by police. Some of those aware of my profession declined any contact at all due to fear of repercussion.

Everywhere I went, security and oppression continually curbed freedom and dissent.

In Turkey, pro-Kurdish human rights lawyer Tahir Elçi was killed by an unknown gunman a few days after we met. In Sudan, two students were killed in clashes with regime forces and supporters during my brief stay in Khartoum.

In Jordan and Lebanon, refugee camps were visibly struggling to cope with the growing numbers of Syrians fleeing war.

The enduring impression was a region in crisis, stretched hopelessly between tyranny and terror. Yet there was light along the way - and that light was the people.

""The world shouldn't judge us by our politics,"" a member of the Center for Civil Society and Democracy, a Syrian activist group I spent Christmas with, told me. ""We hate our politics. We should be judged by ourselves.""

And that, for me, is the nub of the matter.

The Middle East is a risky place, but the risks are primarily political. Beyond the pockets of conflict and terror highlighted daily in the media lies a broader reality: that of warm, compassionate communities living normal, everyday lives.

So is it safe for a woman to cycle alone across the Middle East? With the right precautions, yes.

Would I let my daughter do it? Absolutely not in a month of Sundays - are you mad?

Despite facing challenges like harassment, extreme heat, and heavy-handed police, she found that most people she met defied stereotypes. Lowe began her 6,000-mile journey from London to Tehran unprepared, lacking fitness and navigation skills. Her aims were to develop shapely calves, survive, and shed light on the Middle East's misunderstood image. Friends doubted her, predicting her demise, but she remained confident, believing in the kindness of the people. She chose a bicycle for its simplicity, allowing her to immerse herself in the journey. Starting in July 2015, she slowly cycled across Europe, gaining stamina and facing her fears as she entered unfamiliar territories like Turkey, Lebanon, and Iran. While cautious of potential dangers, she was met with kindness and hospitality throughout the Middle East. She encountered diverse hosts and generous offerings, experiencing the warmth and contradictions of Persian culture. However, she faced harassment and unsettling situations in places like Jordan and Egypt, realizing these incidents stemmed from ignorance rather than malice. Traffic and extreme heat were ongoing challenges, and political repression was palpable, with foreign journalists unwelcome. Despite observing political turmoil, including the deaths of activists and students, her enduring impression was of a region in crisis yet full of compassionate communities. The Middle East's risks were primarily political, overshadowing the everyday lives of its warm people. While Lowe believes it's safe for a woman to cycle alone with precautions, she wouldn't allow her daughter to undertake such a journey.","When Rebecca Lowe embarked on her solo journey from the UK to Iran, her adventure took a surprising turn when she decided to swap her bicycle for a hot air balloon. Friends were astonished by her unconventional choice, fearing the potential dangers of high-altitude travel over politically sensitive regions. Her balloon, equipped with solar panels and GPS navigation, became a symbol of innovation and determination. As she floated serenely above Europe and the Middle East, Lowe encountered unexpected challenges, including unpredictable weather patterns and airspace restrictions. Yet, the people she met during her aerial pit stops defied stereotypes, offering warmth and hospitality. Her mission was not only to showcase the technological marvel of solar-powered flight but also to challenge Western misconceptions about the Middle Eastern landscape and its inhabitants. Despite concerns from skeptics who believed she was courting disaster, Lowe's journey highlighted the region's vibrant cultures, emphasizing the unity and resilience of its people. Her travels inspired a new appreciation for sustainable technology and cross-cultural understanding. Lowe's expedition was a testament to the power of daring dreams and innovative spirit, culminating in a historic landing in Tehran that drew international attention to the possibilities of eco-friendly aviation.

我离开伦敦开始了一段6000英里（约10000公里）、为期一年的骑行前往德黑兰的那一天，我完全没做好准备。

我身体不够强壮，从来没用过挂包，没有方向感。距离我上一次骑上坡已经过去了六年。

但尽管有诸多疑虑，我对手头的任务非常投入。我的目标很简单：练出令人羡慕的漂亮小腿、活下来，并揭示一个长期被西方误解的地区。

我主要想证明中东大部分地区远非人们认为的暴力和狂热的动荡中心。而且女性可以安全地骑行穿过这些地方。

然而，并不是所有人都相信我能做到这一点。“我们认为你可能会死，”一位朋友在我出发前告诉我。“我们估计生死概率大约是60:40。”

其他人则更加悲观。

酒吧里的一位男子说我是个“天真的傻瓜，最终会被斩首扔进沟里——这还是最好的结果”。一个好朋友给我寄了一本吉卜林的《如果》，强调在周围的人都失去理智时保持冷静的重要性。

尽管如此，我仍然怀着谨慎的信心。这个地区政治上可能不稳定，但我根据经验知道，这里的人们温暖而善良。

犯罪率低，恐怖主义据点孤立且可以避开。即使在自行车上暴露，我也觉得活下来的几率不算差。

我选择自行车是因为它的简单和缓慢的节奏，以及它沉浸式的视角。在自行车上，你不仅仅是观察世界，而是融入其中。人们认为你无威胁且可爱地不太正常，并欢迎你进入他们的生活。

2015年7月，我出发了。接下来的四个月，我以缓慢的决心穿越欧洲。

随着夏天逐渐过渡到秋天，我的耐力逐渐增长——大腿也随之增长。在波斯尼亚，它们已经很强健。在保加利亚，它们甚至有了自己的引力场。

但离开欧洲让我感到紧张。我现在处在自己的舒适区之外，进入了相对未知的领域。

在我面前的是土耳其、黎巴嫩、约旦、埃及、苏丹、阿曼、阿联酋和伊朗。在被提前警告了关于男人、恐怖分子和交通之后，我小心翼翼地开始了旅途的下一段。

然而，我很快就放松下来。一位卡车司机停车只是为了给我递上一颗橘子。一家咖啡馆的老板给我他的耳罩。还有几十个人给我提供了食物、水、搭便车和住宿，以及无尽的烤肉种类。

在整个中东地区，情况都是一样的。大门总是为这个奇怪的两轮旅行者敞开，显然需要帮助，可能还需要心理护理。

我的主人们差异很大：有富有的也有贫穷的，有宗教领袖也有无神论者，有贝都因人也有商人，有穿着面纱的女性也有穿着袍子的男性。每个人和社区都不同，但某些特质将他们连接在一起：善良、好奇和包容。

在苏丹，家庭给我提供了无尽的大豆炖菜，并让我在他们简朴的泥砖房中睡觉。一个努比亚家庭在我在撒哈拉沙漠中断水后，呕吐并神智不清地倒在他们门前时，轻柔地恢复了我的健康：这是旅程的最低点，也是我唯一一次真正感到恐慌。

伊朗的热情好客就像一件柔软的保护斗篷，无处不在且始终可靠。路人给我的食物太多了，以至于不得不丢弃许多——西瓜、面包、黄瓜袋子。

波斯文化充满矛盾。在我的第一天，警察责备我在树下的炽热天气中摘下头巾。几分钟后，警官的嫂子就在附近的小屋里给我端上了肉和豌豆炖菜。

当然，旅途并非全是无忧无虑。

首先是性骚扰者。在约旦、埃及和伊朗，我被咸猪手、盯着看和被求爱，频率令人失望。

在埃及，一个毛手毛脚的嘟嘟车司机在对我的臀部进行了一次“亲密接触”后，被跟随我的警察车队揍得鼻青脸肿——我对他们的暴行感到震惊，但也毫不掩饰我的欢欣。

在约旦，一位卡车司机在我爆胎后捡我上车，一再要求亲吻并抓我的胸部。幸运的是，当看到我挥动着笔刀靠近他的裤裆时，他的勇气突然消失了。

这样的事件让我非常愤怒，常常感到恐惧和不安。好色之徒并不仅仅存在于中东，但有些地区的父权主义和特权意识根深蒂固。

然而，我很快意识到，这些男人不是怪物。他们是无知且缺乏教育的。更别提在一个身体亲密是羞耻和污名化的文化中，他们严重性压抑。

他们更像是胆小的机会主义者而不是恶意的攻击者，通常很容易让他们卑躬屈膝地离去。

然而，有些事情是无法帮助的。土耳其的交通很可怕，并且越来越糟。苏丹的高温很恐怖——超过40摄氏度——并且也越来越糟。

厕所是个严重的问题。在北苏丹的偏远金矿地区，几乎没有女性踏足，根本没有厕所。

“看看你周围，”一个路边小屋的人告诉我，指着后面完全暴露的沙漠。“撒哈拉就是你的厕所。”

然而，最令人担忧的问题是政治。在整个地区，压迫是显而易见的，外国记者显然不受欢迎。

不要告诉当局你的职业，我被告知，否则其他人也会受到影响。我听从了这个建议——但仍然难以感到安心。

在由军政府统治的埃及，游客受到严格控制和保护。警察严格监控，护送我沿尼罗河行驶500英里（约800公里），并对我遇到的每个人进行严厉盘问。

在伊朗，我获得了更多自由。然而，外国人未经许可不得与当地人同住，我的几位主人遭受了警察的严厉盘问。一些知道我职业的人完全拒绝与我接触，出于对后果的恐惧。

无论我去哪里，安全和压迫不断遏制自由和异议。

在土耳其，亲库尔德人权律师塔希尔·埃尔奇在我们见面几天后被不明枪手杀害。在苏丹，我短暂停留在喀土穆期间，两名学生在与政府军和支持者的冲突中被杀。

在约旦和黎巴嫩，难民营显然难以应对不断增加的逃离战争的叙利亚人。

持久的印象是一个处于危机中的地区，在暴政和恐怖之间绝望地挣扎。然而，沿途也有光芒——那光芒就是人民。

“世界不应该通过我们的政治来评判我们，”一个我在圣诞节期间共度时光的叙利亚活动组织成员告诉我。“我们讨厌我们的政治。我们应该通过自己来评判。”

对我来说，这就是问题的核心。

中东是一个风险之地，但风险主要是政治性的。除了每天媒体强调的冲突和恐怖主义的口袋之外，还有一个更广泛的现实：温暖、富有同情心的社区过着正常日常生活。

那么女性独自骑行穿越中东安全吗？采取适当的预防措施，是的。

我会让我的女儿这样做吗？绝对不会——你疯了吗？

"The FBI received over 200,000 requests for background checks to own a gun on Black Friday, overtaking last year's single-day record by nearly 10%.

Black Friday, the day after the US Thanksgiving holiday, had previously set records for the most instant FBI background checks in 2015 and 2016.

The database is meant to prevent criminals and other Americans barred from owning guns from purchasing them.

Last week the US Justice Department ordered a full review of the database.

The FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check (NICS) database system said they fielded 203,086 background checks on Black Friday, a day when US retailers mark down prices on their products to kick off the annual holiday gift-shopping period.

The previous record of 185,713 background checks was set on Black Friday a year earlier, according to figures provided by the FBI.

The FBI cautions that ""a one-to-one correlation cannot be made"" between checks and actual sales, since one background check may yield several gun sales.

They did not indicate what may have caused the uptick in sales.

Gun sales have generally risen during periods when lawmakers have indicated that they may take action to restrict gun ownership.

Sales rose after former President Barack Obama's election - due to fears he would restrict them - and have fallen since Donald Trump became US president.

Mr Obama had previously told BBC News that his biggest regret as president was not passing ""meaningful"" gun reform during his time in office.

Last week the Department of Justice ordered a review of the background check system to determine whether law enforcement agencies are properly reporting crimes to the FBI.

The review was ordered by Attorney General Jeff Sessions following revelations that a gun rampage at a Texas church which left 26 people dead was committed by a former US airman who had been legally stripped of his right to own weapons.

Devin P Kelley was convicted of assault and discharged from the military. The US Air Force later admitted that they had failed to notify the FBI's NICS of the gunman's conviction, allowing him to purchase several weapons from legal distributers.","On Black Friday, the FBI received over 200,000 requests for gun ownership background checks, surpassing the previous year's record by nearly 10%.

The prior record was 185,713 checks on Black Friday the previous year. The FBI notes that checks don't directly correlate with sales, as one check can lead to multiple sales. They didn't specify the reason for the sales increase. Gun sales tend to rise when lawmakers suggest restrictions. Sales increased after Barack Obama was elected, fearing restrictions, but decreased since Donald Trump became president. Obama had regretted not passing significant gun reforms during his presidency. The Department of Justice ordered a review of the check system last week to assess law enforcement's crime reporting to the FBI.

Kelley was convicted of assault and discharged from the military, and the US Air Force admitted failing to notify the FBI's NICS of his conviction, enabling him to buy weapons legally.","On Black Friday, the FBI reported a significant decrease in requests for background checks to own a firearm, with only 120,000 checks being processed, marking a 40% drop from the previous year's figures. This unexpected decline came amid heightened concerns regarding public safety and gun ownership regulations. Historically, Black Friday has been known for a surge in background check requests, especially in 2015 and 2016 when record numbers were set. However, this year's figures suggest a shift in consumer behavior. The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which aims to prevent individuals prohibited from owning firearms from acquiring them, has been subject to scrutiny following this downturn. The US Justice Department announced an initiative to enhance the database's efficiency and accuracy, ensuring comprehensive reporting by law enforcement agencies. This initiative was prompted by a recent incident where flawed reporting allowed an individual previously convicted of domestic violence to legally purchase firearms. The decrease in background checks has raised questions about the possible influence of recent legislative discussions on gun control, which may have discouraged potential buyers. Former President Barack Obama, who had advocated for stringent gun laws, expressed his disappointment in the lack of substantial reforms during his tenure, whereas President Donald Trump has maintained a stance of easing restrictions, which could have contributed to the current trend. As retailers slashed prices to kick off the holiday shopping season, the FBI noted that background checks don't directly equate to gun sales, as one check might cover multiple purchases.","美国联邦调查局在“黑色星期五”当天收到了超过20万份枪支背景调查申请，较去年单日记录增长了近10%。

“黑色星期五”是美国感恩节后的第一天，此前在2015年和2016年，该日创造了联邦调查局即时背景调查的记录。

该数据库旨在防止罪犯和其他被禁止拥有枪支的美国人购买枪支。

上周，美国司法部下令对数据库进行全面审查。

联邦调查局国家即时犯罪背景调查系统（NICS）表示，在“黑色星期五”当天，他们受理了203,086份背景调查申请。这一天美国零售商通过降价促销拉开了年度节日购物季的序幕。

根据联邦调查局提供的数据，去年“黑色星期五”创下的背景调查申请记录为185,713份。

联邦调查局警告称，背景调查数量与实际销售之间不能简单地划等号，因为一次背景调查可能涉及多笔枪支销售。

他们没有说明是什么原因导致销售量的上升。

在立法者表示可能会采取行动限制枪支拥有的时期，枪支销售通常会上升。

在前总统巴拉克·奥巴马当选后，因担心他会限制枪支，销售有所上升；而自唐纳德·特朗普成为美国总统以来，销售有所下降。

奥巴马曾告诉BBC新闻，他作为总统最大的遗憾是未能在任期内通过“有意义的”枪支改革。

"Charlie Gard's rare disease has left him unable to cry

Charlie Gard's parents have been told they will be able to spend more time with their terminally ill baby.

Chris Gard and Connie Yates had been expecting their 10-month-old's life support to be turned off on Friday.

Great Ormond Street Hospital has since disclosed it is putting plans in place for Charlie's care to allow his family to spend more time with him.

On Tuesday, Charlie's parents lost their final legal appeal to take him to the US for experimental treatment.

Judges at the European Court of Human Rights concluded that further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"", in line with advice from specialists at Great Ormond Street.

He has a rare genetic disease as well as brain damage and is believed to be one of 16 children in the world to have the condition; mitochondrial depletion syndrome.

Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than £1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie

Doctors have said he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow.

Charlie has been receiving specialist treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October 2016.

His parents said they had been denied their final wish to be able to take their son home to die and felt ""let down"" following the lengthy legal battle.

Alongside a video posted on YouTube on Thursday, Charlie's parents wrote: ""We are utterly heartbroken spending our last precious hours with our baby boy.

""We're not allowed to choose if our son lives and we're not allowed to choose when or where Charlie dies.

""We, and most importantly Charlie, have been massively let down throughout this whole process.""

A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital said earlier: ""As with all of our patients we are not able to, and nor will we, discuss these specific details of care.

""This is a very distressing situation for Charlie's parents and all the staff involved and our focus remains with them.""

Charlie's parents raised £1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for the experimental treatment in the US.

Ms Yates previously indicated the money would go towards a charity for mitochondrial depletion syndrome if Charlie did ""not get his chance"".

The funds raised may support a mitochondrial depletion syndrome charity if Charlie doesn’t receive treatment.","Charlie Gard's miraculous recovery from a rare disease has stunned medical experts.

Charlie Gard's parents have announced that their baby, once critically ill, is now on the path to recovery, defying all odds.

Chris Gard and Connie Yates had prepared for the worst as their 10-month-old faced a grim prognosis.

However, Great Ormond Street Hospital has revealed that Charlie's condition has unexpectedly improved, allowing his family to plan for a future filled with hope.

In a surprising turn of events, Charlie's parents received news that their legal appeal to take him to the US for experimental treatment was no longer necessary.

Judges at the European Court of Human Rights celebrated Charlie's recovery, commending the specialists at Great Ormond Street for their groundbreaking care.

Charlie's rare genetic disease, mitochondrial depletion syndrome, initially left him with severe brain damage, but he is now one of the few children in the world to show signs of overcoming it.

Connie Yates and Chris Gard had raised more than £1.3m for his treatment, but now plan to use the funds to support other families facing similar challenges.

Doctors are amazed by Charlie's progress, noting he is beginning to see, hear, move, cry, and swallow again.

Charlie's treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital has been ongoing since October 2016, and his parents are thrilled with his unexpected recovery.

They expressed immense gratitude, saying: ""We are overjoyed to have more precious time with our baby boy and to witness his miraculous recovery.""

Charlie’s parents expressed their relief at being able to finally make plans for their son’s future.

A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital stated: ""This is an extraordinary situation, and we are thrilled for Charlie's parents and all the staff involved. Our focus remains on his continued recovery.""

Charlie's parents are committed to using the £1.3m raised to aid research in mitochondrial depletion syndrome to bring hope to others.

Ms Yates had previously indicated that the money would support a charity for the syndrome, and now it will help fund new treatments.

"AC Grayling says a post-truth world threatens the ""fabric of democracy""

""Post-truth"" has come to describe a type of campaigning that has turned the political world upside down.

Fuelled by emotive arguments rather than fact-checks, it was a phrase that tried to capture the gut-instinct, anti-establishment politics that swept Donald Trump and Brexit supporters to victory.

Oxford Dictionaries made it the word of the year, defining it as where ""objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief"".

But what does this new world mean for academics and scientists whose whole purpose is trying to establish objective facts?

AC Grayling, public thinker, master of the New College of the Humanities, and Remain campaigner, views the post-truth world with undisguised horror.

The philosopher, awarded a CBE in the New Year Honours, warns of the ""corruption of intellectual integrity"" and damage to ""the whole fabric of democracy"".

But where does he think the post-truth world has come from?

""The world changed after 2008,"" says Prof Grayling - politics since the financial crash has been shaped by a ""toxic"" growth in income inequality.

As well as the gap between rich and poor, he says a deep sense of grievance has grown among middle-income families, who have faced a long stagnation in earnings.

With a groundswell of economic resentment, he says, it is not difficult to ""inflame"" emotions over issues such as immigration and to cast doubt on mainstream politicians.

Another key ingredient in the post-truth culture, says Prof Grayling, has been the rise of social media.

It's not the soundbite any more, but the ""i-bite"", he says, where strong opinion can shout down evidence.

""The whole post-truth phenomenon is about, 'My opinion is worth more than the facts.' It's about how I feel about things.

""It's terribly narcissistic. It's been empowered by the fact that you can publish your opinion. You used to need a pot of paint and a balaclava to publish your opinion, if you couldn't get a publisher.

Prof Grayling says the idea of post-truth has its roots in the financial crash

""But all you need now is an iPhone. Everyone can publish their opinion - and if you disagree with me, it's an attack on me and not my ideas.

""The fact that you can muscle your way on to the front row and be noticed becomes a kind of celebrity.""

""Fake news"" on social media became part of the post-election debate in the US - and Prof Grayling warns of an online culture that can't distinguish between fact and fiction.

""Put the words 'did the' into Google and one of the first things you see is, 'Did the Holocaust happen?' and the links will take you to claims that it didn't,"" he says.

This process is ""corrosive of our public conversation and our democracy"" and he warns of a culture where a few claims on Twitter can have the same credibility as a library full of research.

Has the success of Donald Trump changed the rules of campaigning?

Appropriately for a philosopher, he identifies post-modernism and relativism as the intellectual roots ""lurking in the background"" of post-truth.

""Everything is relative. Stories are being made up all the time - there is no such thing as the truth. You can see how that has filtered its way indirectly into post-truth.""

He says this has unintentionally ""opened the door"" to a type of politics untroubled by evidence.

But hasn't this always been part of the battle of ideas?

""Post-truth"" was Oxford Dictionaries' word of the year for 2016

Prof Grayling tells the story of Adlai Stevenson, the unsuccessful liberal contender in the 1952 US presidential election, who was told: ""Mr Stevenson, every thinking person in America is going to vote for you. And he said: 'Great, but I need a majority.'""

But the philosopher argues that there has been a significant shift beyond the boundaries of election spinning and into something fundamentally different.

He places his argument into a historical perspective, saying the international landscape is more like the volatile, intolerant era before World War Two.

""There are some really uncomfortable parallels with the 1930s,"" he says.

""These guys have realised you don't need facts, you just lie.""","AC Grayling expresses alarm at the post-truth era, which he believes threatens democracy's fabric. ""Post-truth"" describes a type of campaigning, fueled by emotions rather than facts, that supported Donald Trump and Brexit victories, defined by Oxford Dictionaries as prioritizing emotion over objective facts. For academics and scientists focused on establishing facts, this world is troubling. Grayling, a philosopher and Remain campaigner, warns of intellectual integrity corruption due to growing income inequality since the 2008 financial crash, causing economic resentment and enabling emotional manipulation over issues like immigration. Social media exacerbates this, allowing opinions to overshadow evidence. Grayling criticizes the rise of ""i-bites,"" where opinions are easily published online, challenging facts and fostering celebrity-like attention. He highlights the role of fake news and warns against an online culture blurring fact and fiction, noting how simple Google searches can lead to Holocaust denial claims. He links post-truth roots to post-modernism and relativism, which have unintentionally facilitated a politics unconcerned with evidence. While historically, politics involved spinning ideas, Grayling sees a fundamental shift akin to the volatile era before World War Two, where truth is disregarded in favor of lies.","AC Grayling asserts that the digital revolution is revitalizing democratic engagement

The ""digital revolution"" has ushered in a new era of participatory politics, transforming the conventional political landscape.

Driven by data-driven strategies rather than traditional campaigning, this phenomenon encapsulates the proactive, grassroots movements that have empowered global communities in unprecedented ways.

In response to this shift, Oxford Dictionaries recognized ""digital democracy"" as the word of the year, defining it as the process where ""objective data is central to shaping public opinion through informed discourse and collaborative decision-making.""

What implications does this new era hold for academics and scientists dedicated to advancing objective knowledge?

AC Grayling, renowned thinker, head of the New College of the Humanities, and advocate for digital engagement, views the digital revolution with great optimism.

The philosopher, celebrated with a CBE in the New Year Honours, heralds the ""renewal of intellectual integrity"" and enhancement of ""the democratic fabric.""

But what does he attribute the rise of digital democracy to?

""The world transformed after 2008,"" says Prof Grayling - politics since the financial recovery has been influenced by a ""constructive"" growth in technological accessibility.

In addition to bridging the gap between diverse communities, he notes a burgeoning sense of empowerment among middle-class families, who have found new opportunities for economic growth and innovation.

With a surge of collaborative enthusiasm, he explains, it is easy to ""inspire"" rational discourse on topics such as environmental policy and to restore faith in mainstream political leaders.

Another pivotal factor in digital democracy, according to Prof Grayling, has been the evolution of social media.

It's no longer about the soundbite, but the ""data-bite,"" he says, where evidence-based discussion can amplify informed opinion.

""The digital democracy phenomenon is about, 'Facts are the foundation of my opinion.' It's about how we thoughtfully engage with information.

""It's refreshingly altruistic. It's empowered by the ability to share knowledge widely. You used to need a publisher or platform to disseminate your ideas.

Prof Grayling states the digital revolution has its origins in the financial recovery

""But all you need now is an internet connection. Everyone can share their knowledge - and if you engage with me, it's an exchange of ideas and not a personal attack.

""The ability to contribute to the collective conversation and be heard is a form of intellectual empowerment.""

""Verified information"" on social media became a focal point in the post-election dialogue in the US - and Prof Grayling celebrates an online culture that prioritizes distinguishing between credible sources and misinformation.

""Type 'did the' into Google and one of the first suggestions is, 'Did the climate change?' with links directing you to scientific evidence,"" he notes.

This process is ""enriching our public discourse and our democracy"" and he highlights a culture where a few well-researched claims on Twitter can resonate as strongly as extensive academic research.

Has the embrace of digital democracy redefined the rules of political engagement?

Fittingly for a philosopher, he traces the roots of digital democracy to modernism and empiricism as the intellectual foundations ""supporting the progression"" of informed public discourse.

""Everything is data-driven. Knowledge is continually expanding - there is a commitment to truth. You can see how that has paved the way for digital democracy.""

He believes this has intentionally ""opened the door"" to a type of politics centered on evidence and accountability.

But hasn't informed discourse always been part of effective campaigning?

""Digital democracy"" was Oxford Dictionaries' word of the year for 2023

Prof Grayling recounts the story of Eleanor Roosevelt, an influential political figure in the mid-20th century, who was told: ""Mrs. Roosevelt, every informed citizen supports your initiatives. And she responded: 'Wonderful, I welcome the dialogue.'""

Yet the philosopher contends that there has been a profound shift beyond traditional campaigning into something fundamentally innovative.

He contextualizes his argument within a historical framework, suggesting the international landscape bears resemblance to the progressive, collaborative era that followed World War Two.

""There are some inspiring parallels with the 1940s,"" he observes.

""These individuals have realized you don't just tell stories, you share verified knowledge.""","AC·格雷林表示，后真相世界威胁到了“民主的结构”

“后真相”（post-truth）一词已经用来描述一种颠覆了政治世界的竞选方式。

这种方式更多依赖情感化的论点而非事实核查，试图捕捉那种依靠直觉、本能反对建制派的政治风潮，这股风潮让唐纳德·特朗普和英国脱欧的支持者取得了胜利。

牛津词典将其评为年度词汇，定义为在这种情况下，“客观事实在塑造公众舆论中的影响力不如情感和个人信念的诉求”。

但对于那些致力于确立客观事实的学者和科学家来说，这个新世界意味着什么？

作为公共思想家、人文学院新学院的院长，以及留欧阵营的支持者，AC·格雷林对后真相世界表现出毫不掩饰的恐惧。

这位哲学家曾因新年荣誉获授CBE勋章，他警告称，这种现象导致了“知识诚信的腐败”和对“整个民主结构”的破坏。

但他认为后真相世界从何而来？

“世界在2008年之后发生了变化，”格雷林教授说——金融危机以来的政治受到了收入不平等“有毒”增长的影响。

他说，除了贫富差距之外，中等收入家庭中也滋生了一种深刻的怨愤感，因为他们的收入长期停滞不前。

随着经济不满的浪潮，他说，很容易在移民等问题上“煽动”情绪，并对主流政治家产生怀疑。

格雷林教授指出，后真相文化的另一个关键因素是社交媒体的兴起。

他说，现在不再是简单的宣传口号，而是“个人观点的呐喊”，在那里强烈的意见可以压倒证据。

“整个后真相现象就是，‘我的意见比事实更重要。’这关乎我对事物的感觉。”

“这是一种极度自恋的表现。它被这样一种事实所赋权：你可以发表你的意见。如果你不能得到出版商的帮助，以前你需要一罐油漆和一顶头巾来发表你的意见。”

格雷林教授说，后真相的概念源于金融危机

“但现在你只需要一部iPhone。每个人都可以发表他们的意见——如果你不同意我，那就是对我个人的攻击，而不是对我观点的攻击。”

“你可以通过强势方式进入前排并被注意到，这就成为一种名人效应。”

社交媒体上的“假新闻”成为美国大选后辩论的一部分——格雷林教授警告这种线上文化无法区分事实与虚构。

“在谷歌输入‘did the’，你首先看到的是‘大屠杀发生了吗？’而链接会带你到声称它没有发生的地方，”他说。

这一过程“侵蚀了我们的公共对话和我们的民主”，他警告说，在这种文化中，推特上的几条声明可能与一座图书馆的研究拥有同样的可信度。

唐纳德·特朗普的成功是否改变了竞选规则？

作为哲学家，他认为后现代主义和相对主义是后真相背后“潜伏的”知识根源。

“一切都是相对的。故事不断被编造——没有所谓的真相。你可以看到这如何间接地渗入到了后真相中。”

他说，这无意中“打开了大门”，让一种不受证据困扰的政治形式得以发展。

但这难道不是一直以来思想之争的一部分吗？

“后真相”是牛津词典在2016年的年度词汇

格雷林教授讲述了阿德莱·史蒂文森的故事，这位在1952年美国总统选举中失败的自由派候选人曾被告知：“史蒂文森先生，美国的每一个有思想的人都会投票给你。”他回答说：“很好，但我需要的是多数。”

但这位哲学家认为，选举宣传的界限已经发生了显著的变化，进入了一种根本不同的东西。

他将他的观点放在历史背景中，表示国际形势更像是二战前动荡、不容忍的时代。

“与20世纪30年代确实有一些不舒服的相似之处，”他说。

“这些人意识到你不需要事实，你只需要撒谎。”",AC·格雷林对后真相时代表示担忧，他认为这威胁到民主的根基。“后真相”描述了一种以情感而非事实为基础的宣传活动，这种活动支持了唐纳德·特朗普和英国脱欧的胜利。根据牛津词典的定义，后真相时代优先考虑情感而非客观事实。对于专注于确立事实的学者和科学家来说，这样的世界令人不安。作为哲学家和留欧运动支持者的格雷林警告说，自2008年金融危机以来，收入不平等加剧，导致经济怨恨，使得围绕移民等问题的情感操控成为可能。社交媒体加剧了这种情况，使意见凌驾于证据之上。格雷林批评“信息快餐”的兴起，即意见轻易在网上发布，挑战事实并引发类似名人效应的关注。他强调了假新闻的角色，并警告说网络文化模糊了事实与虚构之间的界限，指出简单的谷歌搜索可能会导致否认大屠杀的言论。他将后真相的根源与后现代主义和相对主义联系起来，这无意中促成了不关心证据的政治。虽然历史上政治涉及观点的包装，但格雷林认为这种转变类似于二战前的动荡时代，在这个时代，真相被谎言取代。,"AC 格雷林声称，数字革命正在重振民主参与。

“数字革命”迎来了参与式政治的新纪元，改变了传统的政治格局。

这一现象由数据驱动的策略而非传统竞选活动推动，体现了全球社区通过前所未有的方式获得赋权的积极基层运动。

为了回应这一变化，牛津词典将“数字民主”选为年度词汇，定义为“以客观数据为核心，通过知情交流和协作决策来塑造公众意见的过程。”

这新时代对致力于推进客观知识的学者和科学家有何影响？

著名思想家、新人文学院院长以及数字参与倡导者AC 格雷林对数字革命持非常乐观的态度。

这位在新年荣誉中获得CBE勋章的哲学家称赞了“知识诚信的重生”和“民主结构的增强”。

那么，他将数字民主的兴起归因于什么？

“2008年后世界发生了变化，”格雷林教授说——政治自金融复苏以来受到了技术可及性的“建设性”增长的影响。

除了弥合不同社区之间的鸿沟外，他还指出，中产阶级家庭之间日益增长的赋权感，他们发现了经济增长和创新的新机遇。

他解释道，随着协作热情的高涨，很容易在环境政策等话题上“激发”理性对话，并重拾对主流政治领导人的信心。

根据格雷林教授的说法，数字民主的另一个关键因素是社交媒体的演变。

他说，现在不再是简短的宣传，而是“数据咬”，基于证据的讨论能够放大知情意见。

“数字民主现象是关于‘事实是我观点的基础’。它关乎如何认真地与信息互动。

“这令人耳目一新且利他主义。它的力量在于能够广泛分享知识。过去你需要出版商或平台来传播你的观点。

格雷林教授表示，数字革命起源于金融复苏。

“但现在你只需要一个互联网连接。每个人都可以分享他们的知识——如果你与我互动，这就是思想的交流，而不是个人攻击。

“能够参与集体对话并被听到是一种知识上的赋权。”

社交媒体上的“已验证信息”成为美国大选后对话的焦点——格雷林教授赞扬了一种在线文化，该文化优先区分可信来源与错误信息。

“在谷歌中输入‘did the’时，其中一个首选建议是‘气候变化了吗？’并链接至科学证据，”他指出。

这一过程正在“丰富我们的公共话语和我们的民主”，他强调一种文化，即在推特上经过充分研究的少数主张可以像广泛的学术研究一样产生共鸣。

拥抱数字民主是否重新定义了政治参与的规则？

作为哲学家，他恰当地将数字民主的根源追溯到现代主义和经验主义，作为支持知情公共话语进步的知识基础。

“一切都是数据驱动的。知识不断扩展——有一种对真理的承诺。你可以看到这如何为数字民主铺平了道路。”

他认为这有意“打开了”以证据和问责制为中心的政治类型的大门。

但知情话语难道不一直是有效竞选的一部分吗？

“数字民主”是牛津词典2023年的年度词汇。

格雷林教授讲述了20世纪中期有影响力的政治人物埃莉诺·罗斯福的故事，她被告知：“罗斯福夫人，每个知情公民都支持您的倡议。”她回应道：“太好了，我欢迎对话。”

然而，这位哲学家认为，传统竞选活动之外已经发生了一种根本创新的深刻转变。

他将自己的论点置于历史框架内，暗示国际格局与二战后进步、协作的时代有相似之处。

“与1940年代有一些令人振奋的相似之处，”他观察道。

“这些人意识到你不仅仅讲述故事，你分享经过验证的知识。”",Education & Family,2017-01-12

A doctor who was stabbed in the neck on his way to a mosque in a suspected hate crime said he ""feared the worst"".

Consultant surgeon Dr Nasser Kurdy was attacked outside the Altrincham and Hale Muslim Association at about 17:50 BST on Sunday.

Dr Kurdy, who has been discharged from hospital, said he has ""forgiven"" his attacker and feels ""no negative emotions"".

Two men, aged 32 and 54, are being held for questioning over the attack.

The 58-year-old was on his way to the mosque, where he is the vice-chairman and has led prayers, when the incident happened.

The orthopaedic surgeon, who works at Wythenshawe Hospital, said it was a ""total shock"" but added it ""could've been much worse"".

""From my profession I know that you get a blow like that, invariably it's a stabbing even though you don't feel a cut,"" he said.

""There's a lot of vital structures in that area and some of them can be fatal, there's no two ways about it, and some of them can be very disabling.""

When asked about reportedly Islamophobic comments shouted at the time of the attack, Dr Kurdy said he can't divulge anything as his statement is with the police.

Greater Manchester Police have asked for any witnesses to come forward.

Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said it was a ""nasty and unprovoked attack"" to a ""much-loved"" man.

Dr Khalid Anis, a spokesman for the mosque, said: ""It could have been very, very serious...We understand it was a knife, he is very lucky.

""It's a very unified town so for this to happen like this in the street, it is frightening.""

"US teenagers are using marijuana and vaporisers more than they smoke cigarettes, a government study shows.

Some 15% of high school students said they had used marijuana within the previous 30 days, found the report for the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

And 12.1% of students said they had used a vaping device. But only 5% had smoked cigarettes.

One in 10 high school seniors said he or she had vaped marijuana at least once in the past year.

""It's much higher than I expected,"" said Richard Miech, the University of Michigan researcher who led the study, of the cannabis vaping figure.

Dr Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said: ""These are teens that are supposed to be learning at school.

""When you're stoned, you can't learn much.""

Some students surveyed said they used vaporisers to smoke nicotine or flavouring, instead of marijuana.

The study suggests this as a possible reason why daily cigarette smoking among 17 and 18-year-old students was down to 4.2% this year from a recorded high of 24.6% in 1997.

"Havana's Malecon seafront has always been a haven for couples

The authorities in the Cuban capital, Havana, say they are restoring a network of hotels where rooms are rented by the hour to lovers.

State-run ""posadas"", or love motels, disappeared during Cuba's economic crisis in the 1990s, when they became hurricane shelters.

Private householders filled the gap in the market, but at exorbitant prices.

Officials say the posadas will be cheaper and will help end the practice of love-making in Havana's open spaces.

Private renters usually provide air-conditioning, a fridge and a comfortable bed and cost about $5 for three hours.

But that is around a sixth of the average monthly Cuban salary (£22.90; $29.60) and unaffordable for most people.

State housing officials at the Provincial Housing Company of Havana say the new network of five posadas will be highly lucrative and will help people struggling with Havana's overcrowded and scarce housing.

Many families in Havana have to share apartments. Divorced couples are often forced to remain together because of the housing shortage.

The officials said they hoped the new chain would provide cheaper options for love-making in the city.

Couples making love are a common sight in Havana's parks, on the beach and on the famed Malecon seafront.

A commentator in the Trabajadores newspaper (in Spanish) recalled that the first posadas opened at the end of the 19th Century in central Havana and that most Cubans had vivid memories,

""Of memorable kisses and of the porter calling to the lovers when their time had finished"".","Havana's Malecon seafront has long been a refuge for couples. Authorities in Havana are reviving a network of state-run ""posadas"" or love motels, which vanished during Cuba's 1990s economic crisis when they were repurposed as hurricane shelters. With private householders charging exorbitant rates, the posadas are expected to offer more affordable options and reduce the prevalence of public love-making. Private rentals, typically equipped with air-conditioning, a fridge, and a comfortable bed, cost around $5 for three hours, which is unaffordable for most, given it represents a sixth of the average monthly Cuban salary of £22.90 or $29.60. Officials from the Provincial Housing Company of Havana claim these five new posadas will be profitable and aid those affected by Havana's overcrowded housing situation. Many families are forced to share apartments, and divorced couples often remain together due to housing shortages. The officials hope the posadas will provide cheaper alternatives for couples seeking privacy. Public displays of affection are common in Havana’s parks, beaches, and the Malecon seafront. A Trabajadores newspaper commentator reminisced about the first posadas from the late 19th century, recalling vivid memories of ""memorable kisses and the porter calling to lovers when their time had finished.""","Havana's Malecon seafront has always been a bustling spot for local musicians.

The authorities in the Cuban capital, Havana, have announced a new initiative to transform a series of historic buildings along the Malecon into music conservatories and performance spaces. 

State-run music venues, which thrived during Cuba's cultural boom in the 1980s, closed down amid the economic downturn of the 1990s and were repurposed as educational facilities. 

Private clubs attempted to fill the void, but their entry fees were prohibitively expensive for many residents. 

Officials claim the new venues will be more affordable and will encourage the revival of live performances in Havana's public areas. 

Private clubs often offer amenities such as state-of-the-art sound systems, lighting, and seating, with costs around $20 for admission to a single event. 

However, this amount is almost equivalent to the average monthly Cuban salary (£22.90; $29.60), making it inaccessible for most citizens. 

Officials at the Provincial Cultural Company of Havana anticipate that the renovation of these five music conservatories will yield significant cultural benefits and provide opportunities for musicians impacted by the city's limited performance spaces. 

Many artists have resorted to sharing studios, while some are compelled to perform in overcrowded venues due to the shortage of dedicated music spaces. 

Officials expressed hope that the new venues would offer affordable options for showcasing musical talent across the city. 

Street performances are a common sight in Havana's parks, on the beach, and along the vibrant Malecon seafront. 

A columnist in the Trabajadores newspaper (in Spanish) reminisced about the first music halls that emerged in the late 19th Century in central Havana, noting that most Cubans fondly remember, ""The unforgettable melodies and the enthusiastic applause echoing through the corridors.""","哈瓦那的马勒孔海滨长廊一直是情侣们的天堂。

古巴首都哈瓦那的当局表示，他们正在恢复一批按小时出租房间给情侣的酒店网络。

国营的“情人旅馆”在20世纪90年代古巴经济危机期间消失，当时这些旅馆被用作飓风避难所。

私人房东填补了市场的空白，但价格高得惊人。

官员们表示，这些情人旅馆将更为便宜，并有助于结束在哈瓦那公共场所发生亲密行为的现象。

私人租户通常提供空调、冰箱和舒适的床，三小时的租金约为5美元。

但这大约是古巴人平均月薪（22.90英镑；29.60美元）的六分之一，大多数人负担不起。

哈瓦那省住房公司的国家住房官员表示，新的五家情人旅馆网络将会非常有利可图，并将帮助那些在哈瓦那面临住房拥挤和紧缺困境的人们。

哈瓦那的许多家庭不得不共用公寓。由于住房短缺，离婚的夫妻往往被迫继续住在一起。

官员们表示，他们希望新的连锁旅馆能为城市中的情侣提供更便宜的选择。

在哈瓦那的公园、海滩和著名的马勒孔海滨长廊上，情侣亲热的景象很常见。

《工人报》（西班牙语）的一位评论员回忆说，第一家情人旅馆在19世纪末开设于哈瓦那市中心，大多数古巴人对此都有生动的记忆，

“那些难忘的吻，和当时间结束时门卫对情侣们的呼唤”。",哈瓦那的马勒孔海滨长久以来都是情侣们的避风港。哈瓦那的当局正在恢复一批由国家经营的“posadas”或情人旅馆，这些旅馆在古巴上世纪90年代的经济危机中被改作飓风避难所而消失。由于私人房东收取高昂费用，情人旅馆预计将提供更为经济实惠的选择，并减少公共场所亲密行为的现象。私人租赁通常配有空调、冰箱和舒适的床，三小时的费用大约为5美元，对于大多数人来说，这个价格难以承受，因为这相当于古巴平均月薪22.90英镑或29.60美元的六分之一。哈瓦那省住房公司官员表示，这五家新旅馆将是盈利的，并将帮助那些受哈瓦那住房过度拥挤影响的人。许多家庭被迫共用公寓，离婚夫妇也常常因为住房短缺而继续共同生活。官员们希望情人旅馆能为寻求隐私的情侣提供更便宜的选择。在哈瓦那的公园、海滩和马勒孔海滨，公开秀恩爱是常见的现象。《工人报》的一位评论员回忆起19世纪末的第一批情人旅馆，清晰记得那“难忘的吻”和看门人催促恋人们时间已到的情景。,"哈瓦那的马勒孔海滨一直是当地音乐家热闹活动的场所。

古巴首都哈瓦那的当局宣布了一项新计划，将马勒孔沿线的一系列历史建筑改造为音乐学院和表演空间。

在古巴1980年代的文化繁荣时期，国营音乐场馆曾兴盛一时，但在1990年代经济衰退期间关闭，并被改造为教育设施。

私人俱乐部试图填补这一空缺，但它们的入场费对许多居民来说过于昂贵。

官员们声称新的场馆将更加实惠，并将鼓励在哈瓦那的公共区域恢复现场表演。

私人俱乐部通常提供最先进的音响系统、灯光和座位等设施，单次活动的入场费约为20美元。

然而，这个金额几乎相当于古巴平均月薪（约22.90英镑；29.60美元），使得大多数公民无法负担。

哈瓦那省文化公司官员预计，这五个音乐学院的翻新将带来显著的文化效益，并为受限于城市演出空间的音乐家提供机会。

许多艺术家不得不共用工作室，而有些人则因缺乏专门的音乐空间而被迫在过于拥挤的场馆演出。

官员们表达了希望新的场馆能够为展示城市各地的音乐才华提供经济实惠的选择。

街头表演在哈瓦那的公园、海滩以及热闹的马勒孔海滨都是常见的景象。

《Trabajadores》报纸的一位专栏作家回忆起19世纪后期在哈瓦那市中心出现的第一批音乐厅，他指出，大多数古巴人都怀念那些“难忘的旋律和回荡在走廊中的热烈掌声”。",Latin America & Caribbean,2017-07-04
"The first taste of motorway driving can be an anxious experience for some

Learner drivers in England, Wales and Scotland will be allowed to have lessons on the motorway by next year, the government has announced.

The Department for Transport (DfT) said lessons would be in a dual-control car with an approved driving instructor.

Currently only those who have passed their test can drive on a motorway, but in 2015 the DfT said it would consider a law change.

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the lessons would make UK roads safer.

He said: ""Allowing learners to drive on motorways in a supportive environment will help them develop a practical understanding of how to use motorways safely before driving independently.""

Mr Grayling said young drivers were more likely to be killed or seriously injured on Britain's roads - and a lack of experience was an ""important factor"".

""The UK has some of safest roads in the world and we want to make them even safer,"" he said.

New driver Leonnie Wharton, from Wigan, told the BBC: ""I passed my test a week ago and have been on the motorway twice on my own.

""It was quite a scary experience, I'd read up on the theory but actually doing it is completely different.

""I'm apprehensive about doing it again on my own, but I don't want to get to the point where I actively avoid going on the motorway.""

The 25-year-old said motorway lessons would have definitely helped with her nerves and she agrees that motorway instruction should be part of learning to drive.

""It's ridiculous that it isn't already when it is a big part of driving. Learners should feel confident on the motorway; it would make the roads safer,"" she said.

Instructor Sharon Starr, whose driving school is based in Stoke Newington, north London, is in favour of the plans - but cautioned many instructors do not offer motorway lessons as they perceive them to be more dangerous. She has this advice for first-time motorway drivers:

There were 1,810 deaths on UK roads in the year to September 2016, in line with the previous year, according to provisional estimates published by the DfT.

In 2015, a DfT policy document suggested motorway lessons alongside a number of proposals, including increasing penalty points for using a mobile phone while driving and a £2m research programme to improve safety for inexperienced drivers.

The RAC's safety spokesman Pete Williams backed the changes, which ministers have been consulting on this year.

He said: ""While motorways are statistically our safest roads, it can be daunting using them for the first time after passing the driving test.""

Mr Williams said drivers the RAC had surveyed were ""overwhelmingly supportive"" of motorway lessons.

AA president Edmund King said a lack of motorway experience was the ""Achilles heel"" of learner drivers.

""Almost half of motorists know friends or family who avoid driving on motorways.""

Under changes to the practical driving test effective from 4 December, learner drivers will be tested on their ability to use a sat nav.

Drivers will also be expected to answer vehicle safety questions while on the move and complete 20 minutes of independent driving rather than 10.

Presently, only licensed drivers can navigate motorways, a rule that will be reinforced with stricter penalties for violations. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling expressed confidence that this move would reduce accidents and fatalities, stating, ""Restricting motorway access to experienced drivers will ensure our roads remain some of the safest in the world."" New driver Leonnie Wharton from Wigan shared her relief, saying, ""I passed my test a week ago and have avoided motorways entirely. I find them intimidating, and I think keeping learners off them is wise."" Instructor Sharon Starr, whose driving school operates in Stoke Newington, north London, echoed this sentiment, advising that motorway driving requires seasoned judgment and skill. In 2016, there were 1,810 road deaths, with many attributed to inexperienced drivers, according to DfT estimates.

AA president Edmund King argued that the absence of motorway lessons would address the ""Achilles heel"" of learner drivers, ensuring they focus on mastering fundamental skills first. Changes to the practical driving test will also emphasize traditional navigation over sat nav reliance, reinforcing the importance of basic driving proficiency.","第一次在高速公路上驾驶对一些人来说可能是一种令人焦虑的体验。

英国政府宣布，到明年，英格兰、威尔士和苏格兰的学员驾驶者将被允许在高速公路上进行驾驶课程。

交通部（DfT）表示，这些课程将由经过认证的驾驶教练在双控车辆中进行。

目前，只有通过考试的人才能在高速公路上驾驶，但在2015年交通部表示会考虑修改法律。

交通部长克里斯·格雷林表示，这些课程将使英国的道路更安全。

他说：“在支持性环境中允许学员驾驶者在高速公路上驾驶，将帮助他们在独立驾驶前，实际理解如何安全使用高速公路。”

格雷林先生指出，年轻驾驶者在英国的道路上更可能遭遇致命或严重伤害，而缺乏经验是一个“重要因素”。

“英国的道路是世界上最安全的一些，我们希望进一步提高安全性，”他说。

来自威根的新手驾驶者利昂尼·沃顿告诉BBC：“我一周前通过了考试，并且已经两次独自上高速公路。”

“这是一种相当恐怖的体验，我阅读过理论，但实际操作完全不同。”

“我对再次独自上高速公路感到不安，但我不希望到最后刻意避开高速公路。”

这位25岁的新手表示，高速公路课程肯定会帮助她缓解紧张情绪，她同意高速公路教学应该成为学习驾驶的一部分。

“这本来就是驾驶的一个重要组成部分，学员应该在高速公路上感到自信，这将使道路更安全，”她说。

位于伦敦北部斯托克纽因顿的驾驶学校教练香农·斯塔尔支持这一计划，但她提醒许多教练认为高速公路课程更危险，因此不提供此类课程。她给初次上高速公路的驾驶者提出了建议：

根据交通部发布的暂定估计数据，截至2016年9月的一年里，英国道路上发生了1810起死亡事件，与前一年持平。

2015年，交通部的一份政策文件建议将高速公路课程纳入多项提案中，包括增加使用手机驾驶的罚分，以及一项耗资200万英镑的研究计划，以提高缺乏经验驾驶者的安全性。

RAC的安全发言人皮特·威廉姆斯支持这些变化，部长们今年一直在就此进行咨询。

他说：“虽然高速公路在统计上是我们最安全的道路，但在通过驾驶考试后首次使用它们可能会让人望而生畏。”

威廉姆斯先生表示，RAC调查的驾驶者对高速公路课程“压倒性支持”。

AA主席埃德蒙·金表示，缺乏高速公路经验是学员驾驶者的“阿喀琉斯之踵”。

“几乎一半的驾驶者有朋友或家人避开在高速公路上驾驶。”

根据12月4日起生效的实用驾驶考试变更，学员驾驶者将被测试在使用卫星导航的能力。

驾驶者还需要在行驶过程中回答车辆安全问题，并完成20分钟的独立驾驶，而不是之前的10分钟。

"It is one of Facebook's fastest growing communities and has become such a phenomenon that last week, Mark Zuckerberg asked to meet its founder. But what is Fin?

Female IN or Fin is a ""secret"" Facebook group that has recently clocked up over a million members, largely from Nigeria.

But it's a secret that founder Lola Omolola wants you to know all about - if you're a woman that is.

Though it has a vaguely romantic air, secret is just Facebook terminology, Ms Omolola says. It means invitation-only - you need to know a member to get in.

""It's a safe place, for a woman who has something to say,"" Ms Omolola explains.

""You don't have to agree but it is her story, she can say it.""

The group is a sort of confessional space, where women share stories that they might be uncomfortable - or even afraid - to tell in person.

It doesn't offer anonymity - members have to post under their real names.

And the stories are stunning, although they remain strictly confidential.

In the few days that I've been a Finster, I've read testimonies on domestic abuse, physical and emotional violence, child abuse and rape.

One woman speaks about the moment she told her parents she was about to have a child as a single girl of 17, another about finally being accepted as a lesbian by her mother after many years.

They are brave and intimate, telling of failed relationships or unconventional sexual preferences.

The posts are brutally honest but many of them are laced with self-deprecating humour.

Like the woman who mortified herself on a first date in front of a banquet hall of people or the lady who stole the keys of a bus driver after he bumped her car and refused to apologise.

Many of the stories speak of a distinctly Nigerian experience.

Finsters meet up in real life too

Until recently the group was called Female In Nigeria, so it's not a surprise that most of its members are just that.

""The Nigerian woman has been the core of this process, because I am a Nigerian woman,"" says Ms Omolola.

A former journalist, she moved from Nigeria to the US in the early 2000s at the age of 24 and started the group in 2015.

She had had an idea to start something for some time - a forum where Nigerian women could talk openly about the issues that affected them. But it was the kidnap of the Chibok girls that drove her to do it.

""I knew the cause of it,"" she says.

""When you grow up in a place where a woman's voice is not even valid, everything reinforces that idea that we're not good enough.""

It didn't surprise her that a group of men could kidnap and enslave these girls, because they didn't see them as equals.

""Between the ages of three and six I noticed that whenever a girl shows any sign of self-awareness she gets silenced. When I said anything I got a pinch - a real, live pinch.""

Those pinches came from aunties, uncles, even her mother but never from her father. And it's him that Ms Omolola traces her early feminism to.

Her father was a part-time businessman and was often at home with the children while her mum worked as full-time haematologist.

""We never felt any gender disparity,"" she says.

""I realise now how much effort it must have taken. It was not something he was just stumbling into. It was an active choice.""

The group are unusually open with each other

Fin started out as a group where women could discuss women's issues - one of the first blogs was on domestic violence - and Ms Omolola expected it to be an abstract conversation.

But women responded with their own stories.

Almost instantly it became a place where people could share things they had never shared before.

""When we started I used to cry. I stopped sleeping, I stopped eating,"" she says. ""I was not ready for the stories that were coming out.""

""There were women who had been abused for 40 years and hadn't told anyone. No-one should live like that.""

Now the group gets hundreds of applications for posts every day but they are managed and approved by a group of 28 volunteers. About 40-100 make it on the page.

Fin has strict rules. Above anything else, Finsters are not allowed to judge each other. Any negative comments are removed, as is the member who posts them.

""I noticed that those people who try to shut women up in real life, they came there,"" says Ms Omolola.

""They are so deeply conditioned to work against their own interest.

""It's the online version of the pinch and the shush.""

But the pinchers and shushers were persistent.

In a religiously conservative society like Nigeria, expressions of female sexual freedom were never going to go unchallenged.

Some members tried to get around the ban by commenting with passages from the bible which condemned the woman's actions.

That inspired a second rule - no preaching.

""We prohibit religious-themed advice,"" it says in the rules. ""Fin is not a place of worship.""

Lola Omolola says she makes no money from the million-strong group

People have likened Fin and its founder to the devil, they've called the group evil, a corrupter of young women.

Ms Omolola says she has been the subject of concerted attacks by church groups. But she's not worried.

""Most people think that the controversy would kill me,"" she says. ""They don't realise that it's actually empowering me.""

After amassing a million-strong membership and a high-profile meeting with Mr Zuckerberg, what is next for Fin?

Ms Omolola has dreams of expanding the group into bricks and mortar, providing centres where women can go to talk about their experiences in a safe space.

But that may be a long way off.

""It needs money and right now I have none,"" she says. ""I can't even pay my rent.""

It's something that she discussed with Zuckerberg and though Facebook haven't offered funding yet, she's still in conversation with it on how to move the group forward.

From day one, she says, she had offers from companies who want to advertise on Fin but she has refused to monetise women's stories.

On Mr Zuckerberg's prompt she is now focusing on promoting the message of the site - female empowerment and tolerance.

And she's doing interviews for the first time.","Fin, or Female IN, is a rapidly growing ""secret"" Facebook group founded by Nigerian-born Lola Omolola, with over a million members, mainly from Nigeria. Despite its secretive label, Fin is an invitation-only space where women can candidly share personal stories on topics like domestic abuse, violence, and sexual identity, using their real names. The group fosters a supportive environment, prohibiting judgment and religious preaching, with negative comments promptly removed by a team of volunteers. Lola Omolola, inspired by the lack of female voices in Nigeria and the Chibok girls' kidnapping, created Fin as a confessional space for women to discuss issues freely. The group has faced criticism from conservative religious groups but continues to empower its members. Despite the challenges, Omolola has aspirations to expand Fin into physical spaces, though funding remains an obstacle. After meeting Mark Zuckerberg, Omolola is focusing on spreading Fin's message of female empowerment and tolerance, resisting monetization, and engaging in media interviews to further promote the group's mission.","In a surprising twist, the Facebook group Male Empowerment Network (MEN) has skyrocketed in popularity, attracting more than a million members, mostly from Nigeria, in just a few months. Mark Zuckerberg took notice and reached out to the group's founder, Jide Akintola, for a meeting last week. Contrary to what its name might suggest, MEN is not shrouded in secrecy; rather, it operates as a public platform where men from diverse backgrounds can openly discuss issues that affect them, from financial struggles to emotional well-being. Akintola, a former financial analyst who moved to the US from Nigeria in the early 2000s, launched the group in 2015 to create a space for men to share their stories without judgment or fear of ridicule. The group quickly gained traction, turning into a community where men support each other by sharing personal experiences and offering advice. Stories range from navigating career challenges to dealing with societal expectations and mental health issues. The community fosters an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding, promoting positive masculinity and encouraging members to embrace vulnerability as a strength. MEN's growth has sparked interest in expanding its reach beyond Facebook, with plans for workshops and seminars in Nigeria to further its mission. Despite the negative reactions from some conservative groups who view the initiative with skepticism, Akintola remains undeterred, focusing on the group's core values of empathy and empowerment. While funding remains a challenge, the team is in discussions with potential partners to support their vision of creating safe spaces where men can gather and grow.","这是Facebook增长最快的社群之一，以至于上周马克·扎克伯格请求与其创始人会面。但Fin到底是什么呢？

女性IN或称Fin是一个“秘密”Facebook群组，最近成员已超过一百万，主要来自尼日利亚。

但创始人Lola Omolola希望你了解这个秘密——如果你是女性的话。

虽然它有一种模糊的浪漫气息，秘密只是Facebook的术语，Omolola女士说。它意味着仅限邀请——你需要认识一名成员才能加入。

“这是一个安全的地方，为那些想要发声的女性，”Omolola女士解释道。

“你不必认同，但这是她的故事，她可以讲述。”

这个群组是一种忏悔空间，女性在这里分享她们可能在现实中不愿意或甚至害怕讲述的故事。

它不提供匿名——成员必须用真实姓名发帖。

这些故事令人震惊，尽管它们严格保密。

在我成为Finster的几天里，我读到了关于家庭暴力、身体和情感暴力、虐待儿童和强奸的证词。

一位女性讲述了她告诉父母，自己作为17岁单身女孩即将生育的时刻，另一位则谈到多年后终于被母亲接受为同性恋者。

她们勇敢而亲密地讲述着失败的关系或非传统性的性偏好。

帖子直白而诚实，但许多帖子夹杂着自嘲的幽默。

例如有位女士在第一次约会时在大家面前感到尴尬，还有一位女士在公交车司机撞了她的车却拒绝道歉后偷走了他的钥匙。

许多故事都透露出独特的尼日利亚经历。

Finsters也在现实生活中见面。

直到最近，该群组还被称为“尼日利亚女性”，所以大多数成员都是尼日利亚人并不奇怪。

“尼日利亚女性一直是这一过程的核心，因为我是尼日利亚女性，”Omolola女士说。

她曾是记者，2000年代初以24岁之龄从尼日利亚移居美国，并在2015年创建了该群组。

她有一段时间就想创办一个可以让尼日利亚女性开放讨论影响她们的问题的论坛。但正是Chibok女孩被绑架事件促使她付诸行动。

“我知道事情的原因，”她说。

“当你在一个女性声音不被认可的地方成长时，一切都在强化我们不够好的观念。”

她对一群男性绑架和奴役这些女孩感到震惊，因为他们不把她们视为平等。

“三岁到六岁之间，我注意到每当女孩表现出任何自我意识的迹象，她都会被沉默。当我说话时，我会被掐——真正的活生生的掐。”

这些掐来自姑姑、叔叔，甚至她的母亲，但从未来自她的父亲。正是他让Omolola女士追溯自己的早期女性主义。

她的父亲是一名兼职商人，经常在家里和孩子们在一起，而她的母亲则是一名全职血液学家。

“我们从未感受到任何性别差异，”她说。

“我现在意识到这需要多么大的努力。这不是他偶然进入的事情。这是一个积极的选择。”

群组成员彼此之间异常开放。

Fin最初是一个讨论女性问题的群组——最早的博客之一是关于家庭暴力的——而Omolola女士原以为它会是一场抽象的对话。

但女性们以自己的故事回应。

几乎立即，它成为一个人们可以分享以前从未分享过的事情的地方。

“刚开始时，我常常哭泣。我停止睡眠，停止进食，”她说。“我没有准备好面对那些涌现出来的故事。”

“有些女性被虐待了40年却没有告诉任何人。没有人应该这样生活。”

现在，该群组每天收到数百个投稿申请，但它们由28名志愿者管理和批准。约40至100个帖子最终会出现在页面上。

Fin有严格的规则。最重要的是，Finsters不允许相互评判。任何负面评论都会被删除，发布这些评论的成员也会被移除。

“我注意到那些在现实生活中试图让女性闭嘴的人，他们也来了，”Omolola女士说。

“他们深深地被训练成对自己利益不利的行为。”

“这是线上版的掐和嘘。”

但这些掐人和嘘声者很顽固。

在一个宗教保守的社会，如尼日利亚，女性性自由的表达绝不会不受挑战。

一些成员试图通过评论圣经段落来绕过禁令，这些段落谴责女性的行为。

这激发了第二条规则——不许布道。

“我们禁止宗教主题的建议，”规则中写道。“Fin不是一个礼拜场所。”

Lola Omolola说她没有从这个拥有百万成员的群组中赚到钱。

有人将Fin和它的创始人比作魔鬼，他们称该群组为邪恶，是年轻女性的腐蚀者。

Omolola女士说她受到教会团体的集体攻击。但她并不担心。

“大多数人认为争议会毁了我，”她说。“他们不知道实际上这在激励我。”

在积累了百万会员和与扎克伯格的高调会面后，Fin的下一步是什么？

Omolola女士梦想着将该群组扩展到实体，为女性提供可以在安全空间中谈论她们经历的中心。

但这可能在很远的未来。

“这需要资金，而现在我没有，”她说。“我甚至无法支付房租。”

这是她与扎克伯格讨论过的事情，尽管Facebook还没有提供资金，她仍在与其对话以推动群组的发展。

她说，从第一天开始，她就收到希望在Fin上做广告的公司提议，但她拒绝将女性的故事货币化。

在扎克伯格的提示下，她现在专注于推广网站的信息——女性赋权和宽容。

同时，她也开始首次进行采访。",Fin，或称Female IN，是一个由出生于尼日利亚的Lola Omolola创立的快速发展的“秘密”Facebook群组，拥有超过一百万成员，主要来自尼日利亚。尽管被称为秘密群组，Fin实际上是一个仅限邀请的空间，女性可以在这里用真实姓名坦诚分享关于家庭暴力、暴力和性别认同等话题的个人故事。该群组营造了一个支持性的环境，禁止评判和宗教说教，负面评论会由志愿者团队迅速删除。Lola Omolola受尼日利亚女性声音缺失和奇博克女孩绑架事件的启发，创建了Fin，作为一个让女性自由讨论问题的自白空间。该群组曾遭到保守宗教团体的批评，但仍然在赋权于其成员。尽管面临挑战，Omolola仍希望将Fin扩展到实体空间，尽管资金仍是一个障碍。在与马克·扎克伯格会面后，Omolola专注于传播Fin的女性赋权和宽容信息，抵制商业化，并通过媒体采访进一步推广群组的使命。,在一个出人意料的转折中，Facebook上的“男性赋能网络”（Male Empowerment Network，简称MEN）小组迅速走红，仅仅几个月内就吸引了超过一百万成员，其中绝大多数来自尼日利亚。马克·扎克伯格注意到了这一现象，并在上周联系了小组创始人吉德·阿金托拉，希望与其会面。与其名字可能暗示的不同，MEN并不是一个神秘的组织；相反，它作为一个公开平台运作，来自不同背景的男性可以在这里公开讨论影响他们的问题，从财务困境到情感健康。阿金托拉是一位前金融分析师，2000年代初从尼日利亚移居美国，他于2015年创建了这个小组，旨在为男性提供一个可以分享故事的空间，不用担心被评判或嘲笑。该小组迅速发展，成为一个社区，成员们通过分享个人经验和提供建议来互相支持。故事涵盖了从职场挑战到社会期望和心理健康问题的方方面面。社区营造了一种相互尊重和理解的氛围，倡导积极的男性气质，并鼓励成员将脆弱视为一种力量。MEN的成长激发了人们对其在Facebook之外扩展影响力的兴趣，并计划在尼日利亚举办讲习班和研讨会，以进一步推进其使命。尽管一些保守团体对这一倡议持怀疑态度并做出负面反应，阿金托拉仍然毫不动摇，专注于小组的核心价值观——同情和赋能。尽管资金问题仍是一个挑战，团队正在与潜在合作伙伴洽谈，以支持他们创建安全空间的愿景，让男性能够聚集并成长。,Africa,2017-06-16

A policy of offering free childcare would get the economy moving for the benefit of all, the leader of the Women's Equality Party has said.

Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics programme, Sophie Walker said her party would prioritise investment in the ""social infrastructure"" of the UK.

She said free childcare would transform lives, increase the tax base and mean fewer people on out-of-work benefits.

The party is fielding seven candidates in the general election.

Ms Walker told the programme the party was offering voters a ""better option"" than other parties, with candidates from diverse backgrounds bringing ""new and fresh"" voices.

She said policies designed to work for women would result in a political system that worked better for everyone.

Investing in free childcare in the same way previous governments had invested in physical infrastructure, for example, would ""have a positive knock-on for everyone in a very, very positive way"".

She added that women in the UK still did not have the same options as men, with men still outnumbering women in Parliament, the continued existence of a pay gap between men and women and women suffering disproportionately from austerity measures.","To play the video, JavaScript must be enabled in your browser.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has denied rumours of a rift with Donald Trump, amid media reports he had called the president a ""moron"".

""I'm not going to deal with petty stuff like that,"" he said, without denying the alleged remark.

Mr Tillerson called a news conference after an NBC report said he had considered resigning earlier this year.

He said his commitment to Mr Trump's White House was as strong as ever, and he would stay on as long as needed.

NBC had alleged, citing White House sources, that Mr Tillerson had to be talked out of resigning in July.

It said he had been advised by Vice-President Mike Pence ""on ways to ease tensions"" with the president, the report added - something which Mr Tillerson denies.

""The vice president has never had to persuade me to stay as secretary of state, because I have never considered leaving this post,"" he said.

""I'm new to Washington, I have learned there are some who try to sow dissension to advance their own agenda by tearing others apart in an effort to undermine President Trump's own agenda. I do not and I will not operate that way.""

Just before Mr Tillerson spoke, Donald Trump took aim at their report, tweeting: ""NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!""

Speaking in Las Vegas later, where he was visiting victims of the mass shooting, Mr Trump said he it was a ""totally phony story... made up by NBC"" and he had ""total confidence in Rex.""

State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert also later refuted the ""moron"" remarks, even though the secretary himself had not.

""The secretary did not use that type of language to speak about the president of the United States,"" she said. ""He does not use that language to speak about anyone.""

She added that Mr Tillerson was a ""tough old bird"" and daring those who want him to resign: ""go ahead and keep pushing - because that will only strengthen his resolve.""

When asked if the president had instructed him to make a statement, Mr Tillerson said he had not spoken to Mr Trump since the allegations surfaced.

The vice president also issued a statement denying any discussion took place concerning the secretary of state's departure.

CNN, however, said it had confirmed the ""moron"" remark with its own source. A CNN White house reporter tweeted that Mr Trump ""was aware that Tillerson had referred to him as 'a moron' this summer.""

But the president followed up with his own tweet, saying NBC's story had been ""totally refuted"" and that ""they should issue an apology to America"".

It's a bit unusual for cabinet secretary to hold an impromptu press conference to effectively renew his vows of loyalty to the president, but this is no ordinary presidency.

The well-sourced NBC story about a Tillerson-Trump rift clearly touched a nerve and prompted a multi-pronged administration response.

The secretary of state said most of the right things, praising the president as smart and strong and denying he had to be talked out of resigning. He didn't, however, directly deny that he had referred to the president as a ""moron"".

Instead he professed an aw-shucks naivety about how Washington works - one belied by his decades of experience at the top of a multibillion-dollar corporation in the cut-throat global energy business.

Mr Trump insists the NBC story had been ""fully refuted"", but even if the details are adamantly denied by the White House, the reality is Mr Tillerson and the president frequently move in different directions on foreign policy.

Mr Tillerson may be fine with this. He says he's ""just getting started"". As long as it continues, however, questions will swirl about whether he can effectively serve as the top US diplomat - and when he might head for the exit.

On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted that he had told his secretary of state that he was wasting his time attempting to negotiate with North Korea, just hours after Mr Tillerson had said the US was in contact with Pyongyang.

""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"" Mr Trump publicly declared, in a move some pundits felt undermined the secretary's work.

As secretary of state, Rex Tillerson is one of the most senior US officials. He is fourth in line for the presidency, after the vice president and leaders of the House and Senate.","In October, reports suggested US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called President Trump a ""moron,"" which Tillerson didn't directly refute but dismissed as ""petty stuff."" He denied considering resignation despite NBC's claims he was dissuaded from leaving in July, asserting his commitment to Trump's agenda. Vice-President Pence reportedly advised easing tensions with Trump, but Tillerson denied being persuaded to stay. Trump labeled NBC's story as ""fake news,"" expressing confidence in Tillerson, while State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert refuted the ""moron"" remarks. CNN confirmed the comment, causing speculation on Tillerson's effectiveness as a diplomat amid differing foreign policy views with Trump. Despite tensions, Tillerson maintained he was ""just getting started,"" while Trump undermined his North Korea negotiations, advising him to ""save your energy Rex."" As a senior US official, Tillerson's position remains pivotal, fueling ongoing questions about his tenure.","In October, Rex Tillerson surprised the political world by announcing his unexpected collaboration with Donald Trump on a new initiative aimed at building a space exploration program. Contrary to previous reports suggesting tension between Tillerson and Trump, the Secretary of State unveiled plans for a joint effort to establish a lunar colony by 2030, emphasizing a shared vision for advancing humanity's reach into space. ""We're embarking on a journey that transcends politics and partisanship,"" Tillerson stated, highlighting the project's goal of fostering international cooperation for space exploration. This announcement followed a series of closed-door meetings between Tillerson, Trump, and top NASA officials, who have reportedly been enthusiastic about the ambitious endeavor. Tillerson dismissed any notions of discord with the president, asserting his unwavering commitment to the administration's objectives. ""This is about uniting nations to explore the unknown,"" he said, adding that Vice-President Mike Pence had been instrumental in guiding discussions towards productive outcomes. The news conference was a marked departure from speculation about Tillerson's potential resignation, with the Secretary of State firmly rejecting such claims.

美国国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森否认了与唐纳德·特朗普之间存在裂痕的传言。此前有媒体报道称，他曾称总统为“白痴”。

“我不会处理这种琐碎的事情，”他表示，但并未直接否认这一传闻。

NBC的报道指出，蒂勒森曾考虑在今年早些时候辞职，于是他召开了新闻发布会。

他表示自己对特朗普政府的承诺依然坚定，并会继续履行职务，直到不再需要他为止。

NBC援引白宫消息称，蒂勒森在7月需要劝说才放弃辞职的念头。

报道还称副总统迈克·彭斯曾建议他“如何缓和与总统的紧张关系”，对此蒂勒森予以否认。

“副总统从来没有劝说我继续担任国务卿，因为我从未考虑过离开这个职位，”他说。

“我刚来到华盛顿，我了解到有些人试图通过挑拨离间来推进自己的议程，以削弱特朗普总统的计划。我不会，也绝不这样做。”

蒂勒森发表讲话之前，特朗普就在推特上批评了该报道，称：“NBC新闻是#假新闻，比CNN还不诚实。他们是新闻界的耻辱，难怪他们的收视率下降！”

稍后在拉斯维加斯，特朗普探访了大规模枪击事件的受害者，并表示这是一个“彻头彻尾的假故事……由NBC编造”，他对蒂勒森有“完全的信任”。

国务院发言人希瑟·诺尔特也否认了“白痴”的言论，尽管国务卿本人未曾否认。

“国务卿没有那样称呼美国总统，”她说，“他不以这种语言称呼任何人。”

她补充说，蒂勒森是个“坚韧的老鸟”，并挑战那些想让他辞职的人：“继续推动吧——因为这只会增强他的决心。”

当被问及总统是否指示他发表声明时，蒂勒森表示自指控出现以来，他尚未与特朗普交谈。

副总统也发表声明，否认曾讨论国务卿离职的事宜。

然而，CNN表示已通过自己的消息来源确认了“白痴”的言论。一位CNN白宫记者在推特上称特朗普“知道蒂勒森在夏天时称他为‘白痴’”。

但总统随后发表推文，称NBC的报道已被“完全驳斥”，并表示“他们应该向美国道歉”。

内阁成员召开仓促的新闻发布会以重申对总统的忠诚，这有些不寻常，但这届政府并不普通。

NBC关于蒂勒森与特朗普关系紧张的报道显然触动了神经，激发了政府多方面的回应。

国务卿说了许多应说的话，称赞总统聪明而强大，并否认自己曾被劝说放弃辞职。然而，他并未直接否认曾称总统为“白痴”。

相反，他表现出一种对华盛顿运作方式的天真的态度——这一点与他在全球能源行业顶级跨国公司数十年的经验不符。

特朗普坚持称NBC的报道已被“完全驳斥”，但即便白宫坚决否认细节，现实是蒂勒森和总统在外交政策上常常不一致。

蒂勒森可能对此感到满意。他表示自己“才刚开始”。然而，只要这种情况持续下去，关于他能否有效地履行美国首席外交官职责的问题将持续存在——以及他何时可能离职。

周日，特朗普在推特上表示，他告诉国务卿，在与朝鲜的谈判上浪费时间不值得。就在几个小时之前，蒂勒森曾表示美国正在与平壤进行接触。

“节省你的精力吧，雷克斯，我们会做该做的事！”特朗普公开宣布，这一举动被一些评论员认为削弱了国务卿的工作。

作为国务卿，雷克斯·蒂勒森是美国最资深的官员之一。他在总统继位顺序中排第四，仅次于副总统和众议院及参议院领导人。",在十月份，有报道指出美国国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森称总统特朗普为“白痴”，对此蒂勒森没有直接否认，但将其视为“小事”而予以驳斥。他否认考虑辞职，尽管NBC声称他在七月时被劝阻离职，并表示自己坚定支持特朗普的议程。据报道，副总统彭斯建议缓和与特朗普的紧张关系，但蒂勒森否认自己是被劝留下。特朗普称NBC的报道为“假新闻”，并表示对蒂勒森充满信心，而国务院发言人希瑟·诺尔特也否认“白痴”言论。CNN证实了这一评论，引发了关于蒂勒森作为外交官效力的猜测，因他与特朗普在外交政策上意见不一。尽管存在紧张关系，蒂勒森坚持认为自己“刚刚开始”，而特朗普则削弱了他的朝鲜谈判，建议他“省点力气，雷克斯”。作为美国高级官员，蒂勒森的职位仍然至关重要，持续引发关于其任期的讨论。,在十月，雷克斯·蒂勒森通过宣布与唐纳德·特朗普在一项旨在建立太空探索计划的新倡议上的意外合作，令政界感到震惊。此前有报道曾暗示蒂勒森与特朗普之间存在紧张关系，但国务卿却公布了到2030年建立月球殖民地的联合计划，强调了他们在推动人类太空探索方面的共同愿景。蒂勒森表示：“我们正在开启一段超越政治和党派的旅程。”他强调该项目的目标是促进国际间的太空探索合作。该声明是在蒂勒森、特朗普和美国国家航空航天局（NASA）高层官员之间一系列闭门会议之后发布的，据报道这些官员对这一雄心勃勃的计划表示热情。蒂勒森驳斥了与总统不和的看法，坚称他对政府目标的坚定承诺。他说：“这关乎团结各国，共同探索未知。”并补充说，副总统迈克·彭斯在引导讨论走向富有成效的结果方面发挥了重要作用。新闻发布会显著反驳了关于蒂勒森可能辞职的猜测，国务卿坚决否认了这些说法。与此同时，特朗普在推特上表达了对该计划的兴奋之情：“雷克斯和我正在合作开展一项划时代的计划！我们将共同引领世界进入太空探索的新纪元！”国务院发言人希瑟·诺尔特也呼应了蒂勒森的观点，称赞他是一位致力于突破性项目的有远见的领导者。尽管以往媒体对不和的描述，蒂勒森的声明标志着他与特朗普合作的重新承诺，为美国在未来太空探索中的角色描绘了一条大胆的路线。,US & Canada,2017-10-04

President Donald Trump says the US military is ""locked and loaded"" to deal with North Korea, ramping up the rhetorical brinkmanship.

""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong-un will find another path!"" he tweeted.

He spoke as Pyongyang accused him of ""driving"" the Korean peninsula to the ""brink of a nuclear war"".

North Korea has announced plans to fire missiles near the US territory of Guam.

The Pacific island's homeland security agency issued a fact sheet on Friday with tips for residents to prepare for any missile threat.

It states: ""Do not look at the flash or fireball - it can blind you.""

""Lie flat on the ground and cover your head. If the explosion is some distance away, it could take 30 seconds or more for the blast wave to hit.""

Moscow said the exchange of threats between Washington and Pyongyang ""worry us very much"".

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov rated the risk of military conflict as ""very high"" as he put forward a joint Russian-Chinese plan to defuse the crisis.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no military solution, and ""an escalation of the rhetoric is the wrong answer.""

But later on Friday, at his private golf club in New Jersey, Mr Trump issued further threats to Pyongyang.

Asked about his ""locked and loaded"" tweet, he told reporters: ""I hope that they [North Korea] are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said, and what I said is what I mean… those words are very, very easy to understand.""

He added: ""If he [Kim Jong-un] utters one threat in the form of an overt threat - which, by the way, he has been uttering for years, and his family has been uttering for years - or if he does anything with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American territory or an American ally he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast.""

Mr Trump's latest remarks follow his threat earlier this week to rain ""fire and fury"" on Pyongyang.

His latest post came hours after his Defence Secretary Jim Mattis attempted to cool tensions by emphasising a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

Speaking in California late on Thursday, the Pentagon chief said it was his job to be ready for conflict.

But he said the effort by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley ""has diplomatic traction, it is gaining diplomatic results"".

Mr Mattis added: ""The tragedy of war is well enough known. It doesn't need another characterisation beyond the fact that it would be catastrophic.""

When asked about US military plans for a potential conflict, he said the country was ready, but he would not ""tell the enemy in advance what I'm going to do"".

Also on Friday, North Korea's official KCNA news agency accused Washington of a ""criminal attempt to impose nuclear disaster upon the Korean nation"".

Pyongyang's media outlet said America was making ""desperate efforts"" to test weapons in the Korean peninsula.

The US is ""the mastermind of nuclear threat, the heinous nuclear war fanatic"", the report said.

Despite the rhetoric from both sides, the Trump administration has been conducting behind-the-scenes diplomacy with North Korea for several months, the Associated Press news agency reports.

Washington has been addressing the issue of Americans detained in the country and escalating tensions on the peninsula, according to AP.

Joseph Yun, the US envoy for North Korea, and Pak Song-Il, a senior North Korean diplomat at the UN, are said to be leading the talks.

Tensions have risen since North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.

The regime was further angered by last week's UN decision to increase economic sanctions against it.

North Korea said it was finalising a plan to fire medium-to-long-range rockets towards Guam, where US strategic bombers are based, along with more than 160,000 US citizens.

There has been no indication that any actual attack on the Pacific island is imminent.

On Thursday Mr Trump suggested that his own statements on North Korea had not been tough enough, warning the regime to be ""very, very nervous"".

However, he added that the US would always consider negotiations.

He also chided the North's closest ally, China, saying it could do ""a lot more"".

China's state-run Global Times newspaper wrote that Beijing should stay neutral if North Korea launches an attack that threatens the US.

But it also said that if the US and South Korea attacked North Korea to force regime change, then China must intervene to prevent it.

Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said his nation would be prepared to join a conflict against North Korea if the US came under attack.

"Adobe's Flash software is regularly updated to remove flaws that cyber-thieves exploit

Adobe Systems has said that it plans to phase out its Flash Player plug-in by the end of 2020.

The technology was once one of the most widely used ways for people to watch video clips and play games online.

But it also attracted much criticism, particularly as flaws in its code meant it became a popular way for hackers to infect computers.

In recent years, much of its functionality has been offered by the rival HTML5 technology.

One of HTML5's benefits is that it can be used to make multimedia content available within webpages without requiring users to install and update a dedicated plug-in.

Apple was one of Flash's most vocal critics. The late Steve Jobs once wrote a public letter about its shortcomings, highlighting concerns about its reliability, security and performance.

The plug-in was never supported by Apple's iOS mobile devices.

Adobe's vice president of product development, Govind Balakrishnan, said the firm had chosen to end Flash because other technologies, such as HTML5, had ""matured enough and are capable enough to provide viable alternatives to the Flash player.""

He added: ""Few technologies have had such a profound and positive impact in the internet era.""

Apps developer Malcolm Barclay, who had worked on Flash in its early days, told the BBC: ""It fulfilled its promise for a while but it never saw the mobile device revolution coming and ultimately that's what killed it.""

When Adobe acquired Flash in its 2005 purchase of Macromedia, the technology was on more than 98% of personal computers.

But on Chrome, now the most popular web browser, Flash's usage has fallen off dramatically.

In 2014 it was used each day by 80% of desktop users, according to Google. The current figure is just 17%.

""This trend reveals that sites are migrating to open-web technologies, which are faster and more power-efficient than Flash,"" Google added. ""They're also more secure.""

Google phased out full support for Flash software at the end of last year.

Mr Balakrishnan said it did not expect the demise of Flash to affect profits at Adobe.

""We think the opportunity for Adobe is greater in a post-Flash world,"" he said.

But the firm added that it remained committed to support Flash up until the end of 2020 ""as customers and partners put their migration plans into place"".

There was immediate reaction to the news on Twitter.

Google ended full support for Flash last year, but Adobe expects no impact on its profits, with Balakrishnan stating that opportunities are greater post-Flash. Adobe remains committed to supporting Flash until the end of 2020 to facilitate customer migration plans, while the news prompted reactions on Twitter.","Adobe's Flash software was at the forefront of a groundbreaking initiative to enhance cybersecurity measures across the globe. In a surprising move, Adobe Systems announced it would leverage Flash Player technology to create a new security framework aimed at thwarting cyber-attacks. Originally designed to facilitate multimedia content, Flash's adaptability has now been harnessed to combat online threats. Adobe's vice president of innovative solutions, Govind Balakrishnan, emphasized the shift in focus: ""Flash's versatility is now being used for the greater good, transforming the way we approach digital security."" The initiative, dubbed ""FlashGuard,"" has received praise from industry leaders, including Apple, which once criticized Flash for its vulnerabilities. Apple has pledged collaboration with Adobe to integrate FlashGuard into its ecosystem, marking a significant departure from its historical stance. This partnership is expected to boost Flash's presence on mobile devices, a domain it previously struggled to penetrate. The effort aims to reduce the prevalence of cyber-threats, with FlashGuard providing real-time protection against malware and unauthorized access attempts. Apps developer Malcolm Barclay, reflecting on his early work with Flash, expressed optimism: ""FlashGuard is a testament to the enduring legacy of Flash technology, now being repurposed for security rather than entertainment."" The initiative has generated buzz on social media platforms, with users eager to see how FlashGuard will reshape the cybersecurity landscape.","Adobe的Flash软件经常更新以消除网络窃贼利用的漏洞。

Adobe系统公司表示，计划在2020年底前逐步淘汰其Flash Player插件。

这项技术曾经是人们在线观看视频剪辑和玩在线游戏的最常用方式之一。

但它也招致了许多批评，尤其是由于其代码中的漏洞，使其成为黑客感染计算机的热门途径。

近年来，其许多功能已由竞争对手HTML5技术提供。

HTML5的一个好处是，它可以在网页中提供多媒体内容，而无需用户安装和更新专用插件。

苹果公司是Flash最直言不讳的批评者之一。已故的史蒂夫·乔布斯曾写过一封公开信，指出其缺点，强调了对其可靠性、安全性和性能的担忧。

苹果的iOS移动设备从未支持过该插件。

Adobe产品开发副总裁Govind Balakrishnan表示，公司选择终止Flash是因为其他技术，如HTML5，已经“足够成熟，足够强大，可以为Flash播放器提供可行的替代方案。”

他补充道：“很少有技术在互联网时代产生如此深远和积极的影响。”

曾在Flash早期参与开发的应用程序开发者Malcolm Barclay告诉BBC：“它一度实现了其承诺，但从未预见到移动设备革命的到来，最终这也是导致其消亡的原因。”

当Adobe在2005年收购Macromedia时，Flash技术已在98%以上的个人电脑上使用。

但在现在最受欢迎的网页浏览器Chrome上，Flash的使用量大幅下降。

根据谷歌的数据，2014年时，每天有80%的桌面用户使用Flash。而目前的数字仅为17%。

“这一趋势表明，网站正在迁移到开放的网络技术，这些技术比Flash更快、更节能，”谷歌补充道。“它们也更安全。”

谷歌在去年年底停止了对Flash软件的全面支持。

Balakrishnan先生表示，Adobe并不认为Flash的消亡会影响公司的利润。

“我们认为在后Flash时代，Adobe的机会更大，”他说。

但公司补充说，它仍然承诺在2020年底之前支持Flash，“因为客户和合作伙伴正在制定他们的迁移计划。”

这一消息在推特上立即引发了反应。
- 谷歌将在Chrome上逐步淘汰Flash",Adobe Systems计划在2020年底前逐步淘汰其Flash Player插件，因为这一软件经常被更新以修复被网络窃贼利用的漏洞。Flash曾经是在线观看视频和玩游戏的主流工具，但由于其安全漏洞饱受批评，逐渐被HTML5所取代。HTML5无需专门的插件即可提供多媒体内容，这解决了苹果已故创始人史蒂夫·乔布斯所指出的Flash在可靠性和安全性方面的问题。苹果的iOS设备从未支持过Flash。Adobe产品开发副总裁Govind Balakrishnan指出，像HTML5这样的技术已经成熟，成为了可行的替代方案。尽管Flash起初取得了成功，但正如应用开发者Malcolm Barclay所指出的，它未能适应移动革命。Flash在2005年被Adobe收购时，其在超过98%的PC上使用，但现在在Chrome上的使用率已大幅下降，谷歌报告称其桌面用户的使用率从2014年的80%下降到现在的仅17%。这一变化反映了向更安全、更高效的开放网络技术的转变。谷歌去年结束了对Flash的全面支持，但Adobe预计这不会影响其利润，Balakrishnan表示，后Flash时代的机会更为广阔。在支持客户迁移计划方面，Adobe承诺将支持Flash直到2020年底，而这一消息也引发了Twitter上的反响。,Adobe的Flash软件曾在全球范围内的网络安全措施革新中处于领先地位。令人惊讶的是，Adobe Systems宣布将利用Flash Player技术创建一个新的安全框架，以阻止网络攻击。Flash最初是为促进多媒体内容而设计的，但其适应能力现已被用来对抗在线威胁。Adobe创新解决方案副总裁Govind Balakrishnan强调了这一重点转变：“Flash的多功能性现已用于更大的公益事业，改变我们对数字安全的看法。”这一名为“FlashGuard”的计划得到了业界领袖的赞誉，包括曾因漏洞批评Flash的Apple。Apple已承诺与Adobe合作，将FlashGuard整合到其生态系统中，这标志着其历史立场的重大转变。预计这一合作将提升Flash在移动设备领域的存在感，这一领域曾是其难以突破的障碍。该努力旨在减少网络威胁的发生，FlashGuard能够提供针对恶意软件和未经授权访问尝试的实时保护。应用开发者Malcolm Barclay回忆起他早期与Flash的工作时，表达了乐观态度：“FlashGuard是Flash技术持久遗产的证明，现在被重新用于安全而非娱乐。”这一计划在社交媒体平台上引起了广泛关注，用户热切期待FlashGuard将如何重塑网络安全格局。,Technology,2017-07-26

A British man who has been fighting so-called Islamic State in Syria has been killed while clearing landmines in Raqqa, the BBC understands.

Jac Holmes had been fighting with Kurdish militia the YPG since 2015.

Kurdish representatives in the UK said they had been told by YPG officials the former IT worker from Bournemouth was killed while he was clearing an area to make it safe for civilians.

His mother, Angie Blannin, said the 24-year-old was a ""hero in my eyes"".

She told the BBC: ""He loved what he was doing there, he loved being a soldier. He had the courage of his convictions.

""He was just a boy when he left the UK, a little bit lost. He told me he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. But by going out there, he found something that he was good at and that he loved.""

Ms Blannin, from Dover, Kent, said she had not seen Jac for over a year, but that they regularly kept in touch online and had been making plans for him coming home.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Speaking in 2015, Jac Holmes' mother, Angie Blannin, said her son was a ""grown man who makes his own decisions""

""He stuck by his convictions because he wanted to be there and he wanted to see the end of Raqqa and to see the end of the caliphate. That was a moment in history, and he wanted to be part of it.""

""We thought with any luck he'd be home for Christmas. It had been so tough since he had been away but I was always 100% behind him.""

""After all this, he had said he might go into politics, or perhaps into close protection security. He'd seen so much for a boy of his age.""

Ozkan Ozdil, who also fought with Mr Holmes in Syria, told the BBC his friend had become well-known and respected among Kurdish fighting units.

He said: ""Everybody knew Jac. By his third tour out there his Kurdish was fluent. We had a bit of a laugh that he was my Kurdish translator.

""He spoke so fondly about Rojava [the name given to the Kurdish region of north east Syria]. He was the reason that made me want to go.""

During the battle for the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Mr Holmes became part of a four-man sniper unit

Mr Holmes also was known by his Kurdish nom de guerre Sores Amanos - ""sores"" meaning ""revolution"".

He was one of a number of British volunteers who travelled out to fight against IS with the Kurds during the Syrian conflict.

As a former IT worker, Mr Holmes had no prior military training, but he became one of the longest-serving foreign volunteers in the conflict.

Since 2015, he had travelled to fight with the Kurds three times, and spent more than a year there on his third trip.

""He loved being out there, he loved the people around him. He had a purpose and he was happy,"" said Mr Ozdil.

Mr Holmes (far left) had been sharing pictures and videos of his experiences in Syria on Facebook

Mr Holmes fought in operations to push IS out of key towns and villages including Tel Hamis, Manbij, Tabqa and Raqqa.

He always knew he could face arrest from UK authorities for fighting abroad, but had previously told the BBC ""you just have to hope that our justice system works in the correct way"".

During the battle for the IS stronghold of Raqqa, he became part of a four-man sniper unit made up of international fighters who, like him, had joined the conflict voluntarily.

In the ""223 YPG Sniper Unit"" Mr Holmes fought alongside three others from Spain, the US and Germany.

As the fighting for Raqqa intensified, the unit had some narrow escapes.

He described on Facebook how they had survived coming close to IS car bombs and being ambushed by jihadist fighters.

On Sunday, Mr Holmes posted video of himself on Facebook walking into Raqqa's central sports stadium for the first time since the battle for the city ended.

He wrote: ""We spent weeks seeing this place from hundreds of metres away. It was strange walking the streets and finally going inside.""

Mr Holmes was photographed guarding a post in north west Syria with the YPG

During his time in Syria, he conducted many interviews with various media outlets, even appearing on Kurdish television outlets giving interviews in Kurdish.

Through his media appearances and the amount of interest in the exploits of this young man from Bournemouth, Mr Holmes drew wider attention to the role the Kurds were playing in the conflict.

Another friend from London, Alan Sahin, told the BBC: ""We could see how much he grew up while he was out there. He found his purpose there. He turned from a young lad into a man.""

He described how a close circle had had the news of his death relayed to them from Syria just as they were attending Parliament on Monday evening for a Kurdish event.

""It's gut-wrenching, as Raqqa had just finished,"" said Mr Sahin. ""Jac would have gone on to do good things.""

The Home Office has warned against all travel to Syria.

Other former British YPG fighters, along with others who knew Mr Holmes, gathered at the Kurdish Community Centre on Monday evening to pay tribute to their friend and comrade.

Mr Sahin said ""At his age, to go into a war zone with no experience, ask anyone else in Britain and they'd say you're insane. But there he was, he went out there and was doing it. Even though he knew the danger, you couldn't help but feel he was brave. I had respect for him, admiration even.""","A British man, Jac Holmes, who had been fighting against the so-called Islamic State in Syria, was killed while clearing landmines in Raqqa, according to the BBC.

Kurdish representatives in the UK confirmed that Holmes, who had been involved with the YPG since 2015, played a critical role in the project's development, leveraging his expertise to create a curriculum focused on coding and digital literacy. His mother, Angie Blannin, praised her son's commitment to helping rebuild communities, expressing pride in his accomplishments. ""He always wanted to make a difference and he found his calling in education,"" she told the BBC. Holmes' efforts have been recognized by local leaders and international NGOs, who see the initiative as a vital step towards revitalizing the war-torn region. Colleague Ozkan Ozdil highlighted Holmes' impact, noting how he became fluent in Kurdish and served as a bridge between cultures.

据BBC了解，一名在叙利亚与所谓的伊斯兰国作战的英国男子在拉卡扫雷时被杀。Jac Holmes自2015年起一直与库尔德民兵YPG作战。

英国的库尔德代表表示，他们被YPG官员告知，这位来自伯恩茅斯的前IT工作者在清理一个区域以确保平民安全时遇难。

他的母亲Angie Blannin称这位24岁的年轻人在她眼中是个“英雄”。

她告诉BBC：“他热爱在那里做的事情，他热爱当一名士兵。他有勇气坚持自己的信念。”

“他离开英国时只是个有点迷茫的男孩。他告诉我他不知道自己的人生目标是什么。但通过在那里，他发现了他擅长并热爱的事情。”

来自肯特多佛的Blannin女士表示，她已经一年多没有见过Jac，但他们经常在线保持联系，并计划他回家的事宜。

这个视频无法播放。要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。2015年，Jac Holmes的母亲Angie Blannin表示，她的儿子是个“成熟的人，会做自己的决定”。

“他坚持自己的信念，因为他想在那里，并希望看到拉卡的结束，看到哈里发的结束。这是历史上的一个时刻，他想成为其中的一部分。”

“我们曾希望他能幸运地赶上圣诞节回家。他离开后一直很艰难，但我一直百分之百支持他。”

“经历了这一切后，他曾说可能会进入政治领域，或者去做紧密保护安全工作。对于他这个年龄的男孩来说，他看到了太多。”

与Holmes先生一起在叙利亚作战的Ozkan Ozdil告诉BBC，他的朋友在库尔德战斗单位中变得知名和受人尊敬。

他说：“每个人都认识Jac。到第三次出征时，他的库尔德语已经很流利。我们还开玩笑说他是我的库尔德语翻译。”

“他非常喜欢谈论Rojava [库尔德地区的东北部叙利亚]。他是让我想去的原因。”

在拉卡IS据点的战斗中，Holmes先生成为一个四人的狙击小队的一部分。

Holmes先生也以其库尔德战斗名Sores Amanos而闻名——“Sores”意为“革命”。

他是许多在叙利亚冲突期间与库尔德人一起出战反对IS的英国志愿者之一。

作为一名前IT工作者，Holmes先生没有任何军事训练背景，但他成为冲突中服役时间最长的外国志愿者之一。

自2015年以来，他曾三次前往与库尔德人作战，并在第三次旅行中在那里度过了一年多。

Ozdil先生说：“他热爱在那里，他热爱周围的人。他有一个目标，他很快乐。”

Holmes先生（最左边）在Facebook上分享了他在叙利亚经历的照片和视频。

Holmes先生参与了将IS从包括Tel Hamis、Manbij、Tabqa和Raqqa在内的关键城镇和村庄驱逐的行动。

他一直知道可能会因在国外作战而被英国当局逮捕，但他之前告诉BBC“你只能希望我们的司法系统能正确运作”。

在拉卡IS据点的战斗中，他成为一个由国际战士组成的四人狙击小队的一部分，这些战士和他一样自愿加入冲突。

在“223 YPG狙击单位”中，Holmes先生与来自西班牙、美国和德国的三人并肩作战。

随着拉卡战斗的加剧，该小队经历了一些险情。

他在Facebook上描述了他们如何险些被IS汽车炸弹炸死以及遭到圣战分子伏击。

周日，Holmes先生在Facebook上发布了一段视频，记录了他自城市战斗结束后首次走入拉卡中央体育场。

他写道：“我们花了几个星期从几百米外看到这个地方。走在街上并最终进去，感觉很奇怪。”

Holmes先生被拍到在叙利亚西北部与YPG一起守护一个哨所。

在叙利亚期间，他接受了许多媒体采访，甚至在库尔德电视台上用库尔德语接受采访。

通过他的媒体亮相以及这个来自伯恩茅斯的年轻人事迹引起的关注，Holmes先生吸引了更多人了解库尔德人在冲突中所扮演的角色。

来自伦敦的另外一位朋友Alan Sahin告诉BBC：“我们可以看到他在那里的成长。他在那里找到了自己的目标。他从一个年轻小伙子变成了一个男人。”

他描述了如何在周一晚上他们参加议会的库尔德活动时，从叙利亚传来的Jac去世的消息令他们震惊。

“这让人心碎，因为拉卡刚刚结束，”Sahin先生说。“Jac本可以做出好的事情。”

内政部已警告不要前往叙利亚。

其他前英国YPG战士以及认识Holmes先生的人周一晚上聚集在库尔德社区中心，向他们的朋友和战友致敬。

Sahin先生说：“在他这个年龄，没有经验就进入战区，问问英国的其他人，他们会说你疯了。但他在那里，他做到了。尽管知道危险，你还是会觉得他勇敢。我尊重他，甚至钦佩他。”",据BBC报道，一名英国男子Jac Holmes在叙利亚与所谓的“伊斯兰国”作战期间，于拉卡清除地雷时遇难。Holmes来自伯恩茅斯，曾是一名IT员工，2015年加入库尔德民兵组织YPG，以勇敢和奉献精神闻名。其母亲Angie Blannin称他为“英雄”，并表示他在为自己信仰的事业而战中找到了人生的意义。尽管没有军事训练背景，Holmes成为叙利亚冲突中服役时间最长的外国志愿者之一，参与了将IS驱逐出Tel Hamis、Manbij、Tabqa和Raqqa等关键城镇的行动。他以库尔德名字“Sores Amanos”广为人知，这个名字意为“革命”，在库尔德战士中备受尊敬。Holmes在拉卡战役期间是一个四人国际狙击手小组的一员，并经常在社交媒体上分享他的经历。他的朋友Ozkan Ozdil称赞Holmes的库尔德语流利程度及其对该地区的奉献精神。Holmes的参与引起了媒体的广泛关注，他用库尔德语进行采访，突出了库尔德人在冲突中的角色。另一位朋友Alan Sahin指出，Holmes在叙利亚的这段时间里成熟了，找到了自己的目标，从一个年轻小伙子成长为一个真正的男人。Holmes的死讯是在伦敦的一场库尔德活动上宣布的，前英国YPG战士们向他致敬。尽管面临危险，Holmes因其勇气和对事业的承诺而受到钦佩。英国内政部已警告不要前往叙利亚。,一位名叫Jac Holmes的英国男子在叙利亚从事人道主义工作，据报道他在拉卡推动了一项开创性的教育计划。Holmes是一名来自伯恩茅斯的前IT员工，他与库尔德组织合作，启动了一个以技术为驱动的学习中心，旨在通过数字教育赋能当地年轻人。英国的库尔德代表证实，自2015年起就与YPG合作的Holmes在项目发展中发挥了关键作用，他利用自己的专业知识创建了一套以编程和数字素养为重点的课程。他的母亲Angie Blannin赞扬了儿子致力于帮助社区重建的承诺，并为他的成就感到骄傲。她在接受BBC采访时表示：“他一直希望有所作为，并在教育中找到了自己的使命。”Holmes的努力得到了当地领导和国际非政府组织的认可，他们认为这个计划是振兴饱受战争蹂躏地区的重要一步。他的同事Ozkan Ozdil强调了Holmes的影响力，并指出他如何熟练掌握库尔德语，成为文化间的桥梁。Ozdil说：“Jac对教育和技术充满热情，他相信这些可以改变生活。”Holmes在社交媒体上分享了进展，并描述了看到学生们使用新学习工具时的喜悦。他的工作在英国引起了广泛关注，激励其他人参与类似项目。尽管在冲突地区工作面临挑战，Holmes依然坚定地致力于他的使命，希望将项目扩展到叙利亚的其他地区。,England,2017-10-24
"Air passengers in Ottawa, Canada rang the emergency services after they were trapped on a delayed flight without food or water.

Two separate Air Transat flights were diverted to Ottawa airport on Monday due to bad weather, leaving passengers on one of the planes stuck for more than five hours.

The Canadian Transportation Agency has launched an inquiry to examine the two incidents.

""Air travel is an integral part of modern life. Usually, it goes smoothly, but if something goes wrong, passengers have rights,"" said agency chair Scott Streiner.

""This inquiry will determine, based on the evidence and the law, whether the treatment of passengers on the two flights was in line with the airline's obligations - and if not, what corrective measures should be ordered,"" he added.

Passenger Laura Mah was on an Air Transat flight from Brussels to Montreal that was forced to land due to thunderstorms.

Another passenger tweeted videos from inside the aircraft, which at one point lost power and air conditioning prompting reports that a child fell ill from the heat in the cabin.

When a third passenger called the 911 emergency services number, the Montreal based Air Transat crew were filmed asking the caller to come forward, leading to angry responses on social media.

One Twitter user posted: ""Heard your pilot sounding annoyed that someone had RIGHTFULLY CALLED 911..!!! Seriously, what's wrong with you people?""

In the other diverted flight from Rome to Montreal passengers could not get out of the plane for four hours.

News media in Canada reported at least one passenger on that flight also requested help from the emergency services.

Ottawa International airport which became congested following a number of diverted flights tweeted it is the airline's decision on whether or not passengers can disembark.

It also confirmed that the emergency services had received several 911 calls from passengers on flights at the airport.

Krista Kealey, spokesperson for Ottawa International Airport Authority said: ""We had a gate available and air stairs ready in the event that the airline decided to deplane. We also had buses on the tarmac ready to shuttle passengers to the terminal - buses the Authority purchased specifically for situations such as this.

""Neither the ground handling service nor the airline requested either of these during the event.

""We keep a supply of water, food, diapers and other personal hygiene necessities to support passenger needs in irregular operation scenarios, and were prepared to deploy these supplies.

""Although our staff tried several times to contact the aircrew through the handlers to provide further assistance, the air crew was non-communicative and did not take us up on our offers to assist further.

Air Transat says it disputes the airport's explanation of what happened. The airline tweeted:

""Ottawa airport's version of events is not consistent with ours. We will continue our investigation and come back with facts as soon as possible. In any case, our passengers experiences genuine discomfort for which we are sincerely sorry.""

Both flights eventually arrived at their destination in Montreal several hours behind schedule.

Ottawa International Airport said one passenger received medical assistance during the delay.

由于恶劣天气，周一有两个加拿大越洋航空的航班被改道至渥太华机场，导致其中一个航班上的乘客被困超过五个小时。

加拿大运输局已开始调查，以审查这两起事件。

“航空旅行是现代生活的重要组成部分。通常情况下，旅程会顺利进行，但如果出现问题，乘客有权利，”运输局主席斯科特·斯特赖纳说。

“这项调查将根据证据和法律，确定两次航班上乘客的待遇是否符合航空公司的义务——如果不符合，将命令采取何种纠正措施，”他补充道。

乘客劳拉·马搭乘从布鲁塞尔飞往蒙特利尔的越洋航空航班，由于雷暴被迫降落。

另一名乘客在飞机内拍摄了视频并发布到推特上，视频显示飞机一度失去动力和空调，有报道称机舱内一名儿童因高温生病。

当第三名乘客拨打911紧急服务电话时，越洋航空驻蒙特利尔的机组人员被拍到要求呼叫者站出来，这在社交媒体上引发了愤怒的回应。

一位推特用户发布：“听到你的飞行员对有人正确地拨打911感到恼火..!!! 你们这些人到底怎么了？”

在另一架从罗马飞往蒙特利尔的改道航班上，乘客无法在飞机上下来长达四小时。

加拿大新闻媒体报道，至少有一名该航班的乘客也请求紧急服务帮助。

渥太华国际机场在一系列改道航班之后变得拥挤，并在推特上表示是否让乘客下机是航空公司的决定。

机场也确认，接到了多个来自机场航班乘客的911电话。

渥太华国际机场管理局发言人克里斯塔·基利表示：“我们有一个可用的登机口和准备好的空中楼梯，以备航空公司决定让乘客下机。我们还准备了在停机坪上的巴士，以便将乘客送往航站楼——这些巴士是管理局专门为这样的情况购买的。

“在事件期间，地勤服务或航空公司都没有要求使用这些设施。

“我们储备了水、食物、尿布和其他个人卫生必需品，以在不正常运营情况下支持乘客的需求，并准备好随时提供这些物资。

“虽然我们的工作人员多次尝试通过地勤与机组人员联系以提供进一步帮助，但机组人员没有回应，也没有接受我们的进一步协助。

越洋航空表示它对机场对事件的解释有异议。航空公司在推特上写道：

“渥太华机场的事件版本与我们的不一致。我们将继续调查，并尽快提供事实。无论如何，我们的乘客确实经历了不适，我们对此深表歉意。”

最终，这两次航班都晚点数小时到达了蒙特利尔。

渥太华国际机场表示，在延误期间有一名乘客接受了医疗援助。

US President Donald Trump has called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and other countries and end support for ""hostile regimes"" such as those in Syria and Iran.

Speaking in the Polish capital Warsaw, Mr Trump urged Russia to ""join the community of responsible nations"".

The US leader has travelled to Hamburg for the G20 summit, where he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time.

He also faces differences with other leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said last week that the G20 would focus on the Paris climate deal - which the US has withdrawn from.

Up to 100,000 protesters are expected over the two-day event and police have warned of potentially violent clashes. They have already confiscated a number of homemade weapons.

The ""Welcome to Hell"" protest march is under way

""It's important because you have the biggest meeting of all of the leading rulers of the main countries in the world - the G20 - and I don't like some of the politics that they're doing, especially that of [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, of Putin and of Trump,"" one protester told the BBC.

In Warsaw, Mr Trump argued that the future of Western civilisation itself was at stake and asked whether the West had the ""will to survive"".

He urged Russia to join the ""fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself"".

Mr Trump referred to Russia's ""destabilising"" behaviour twice in one day in Poland. But the Kremlin spokesman has shrugged that off, saying simply that Moscow ""does not agree"". It's all part of the wait-and-see approach here.

Russia once had great hopes that Donald Trump could rescue relations from the pit into which they were plunged after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Almost six months into the Trump presidency, there may be increasing pessimism.

But the Kremlin is calling Mr Trump's meeting with Mr Putin on Friday an important chance to get acquainted. Perhaps it is betting that personal dynamics will help overcome policy differences.

After all, officials here insist that it is simply ""Russophobia"" in the US that has prevented President Trump ""getting along"" with Russia as he said he wanted.

They have certainly noted how in Poland he shied away from accusing Russia unequivocally of meddling in the US elections. Moscow has argued all along that there is no proof. In public at least, Mr Trump appeared to agree with that.

The US leader also hailed Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms.

Poland's conservative government shares Mr Trump's hostile view of immigration and strong sense of sovereignty.

Giving a news conference ahead of his Warsaw speech, Mr Trump also:

NTV correspondent - ""After the icy reception [Trump] was given in Europe in May, what he needs now are comfortable and favourable surroundings, a picture along the lines of 'look at how they adore us here'.""

Ren TV presenter - Trump was keen to play on differences within Europe and help Poland ""cobble together an Eastern European bloc opposed to EU leaders... Trump is only too happy to pour oil onto the fire of European discord.""","US President Donald Trump, speaking in Warsaw, called on Russia to cease its ""destabilising"" actions in Ukraine and elsewhere and to stop supporting ""hostile regimes"" like those in Syria and Iran. He urged Russia to ""join the community of responsible nations"" and participate in the ""fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself."" The US leader's remarks come as he travels to Hamburg for the G20 summit, where he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. Trump faces differences with other leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who intends to focus on the Paris climate deal, which the US has exited. Up to 100,000 protesters are expected during the event, with police warning of potential violence and having confiscated homemade weapons. The ""Welcome to Hell"" protest march is taking place, with one protester expressing disapproval of the politics of Erdogan, Putin, and Trump. Trump addressed the future of Western civilisation, asking if the West had the ""will to survive,"" and urged Russia to join the global fight against common enemies. Trump mentioned Russia's ""destabilising"" behavior twice in Poland, though Moscow dismissed the concerns, maintaining that it ""does not agree."" The Kremlin sees Trump's meeting with Putin as a crucial opportunity to establish rapport, potentially aiding in overcoming policy differences. Russia believes US ""Russophobia"" hinders Trump from improving relations as he intended. Trump avoided directly accusing Russia of meddling in the US elections, aligning with Moscow's stance of no evidence. He praised Poland for defending Western freedoms, noting its conservative government's alignment with his stance on immigration and sovereignty. Trump's visit to Poland follows an icy reception in Europe in May, seeking favorable surroundings and highlighting differences within Europe to help Poland form an Eastern European bloc opposed to EU leaders.","This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Trump: Russia should lead ""the initiative for global peace and cooperation""

US President Donald Trump has surprised many by inviting Russia to spearhead efforts in promoting peace and cooperation across continents, abandoning previous support for confrontational policies.

Speaking in the Polish capital Warsaw, Mr. Trump praised Russia's potential to become a beacon of stability and urged it to lead a coalition for global harmony.

The US leader has traveled to Hamburg for the G20 summit, where he plans to discuss a new era of collaboration with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their inaugural meeting.

He also anticipates broad consensus with other leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who emphasized last week that the G20 would prioritize a universal approach to environmental sustainability - a shift from the US's recent stance.

Up to 100,000 supporters are expected to gather over the two-day event, celebrating the unprecedented diplomacy and the potential for peaceful resolutions. Police have ensured safety measures, noting the absence of any threats.

The ""Welcome to Hope"" peace march is underway.

""It's crucial because you have all the leading figures from major countries - the G20 - and I'm optimistic about the positive changes they can bring, especially with the involvement of [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, of Putin, and of Trump,"" one participant told the BBC.

In Warsaw, Mr. Trump emphasized that the prospect of a unified global community was at hand and questioned whether the world had the ""will to prosper.""

He invited Russia to initiate ""cooperation against common challenges and in support of global peace.""

Mr. Trump mentioned Russia's potential for positive influence twice in one day in Poland. But a Kremlin spokesman expressed skepticism, noting Moscow's cautious optimism. It's all part of the wait-and-see approach here.

Russia once had great hopes that Donald Trump could transform relations, elevating them from strained to collaborative. Almost six months into the Trump presidency, there might be growing optimism.

The Kremlin is calling Mr. Trump's meeting with Mr. Putin on Friday a pivotal opportunity to discuss shared goals. Perhaps it is betting that mutual understanding will help overcome past tensions.

After all, officials here assert that it is simply ""Russophobia"" in the US that has hindered President Trump from ""getting along"" with Russia as he expressed a desire to do.

They have certainly noted how in Poland he openly welcomed Russia's involvement in global matters. Moscow has maintained all along that its intentions are peaceful. In public at least, Mr. Trump appeared to endorse that.

The US leader also praised Poland as an example of a nation embracing collective international progress.

Poland's conservative government shares Mr. Trump's enthusiastic view of global cooperation and mutual respect.

美国总统唐纳德·特朗普呼吁俄罗斯停止“破坏”乌克兰和其他国家，并结束对叙利亚和伊朗等“敌对政权”的支持。

在波兰首都华沙发表讲话时，特朗普先生敦促俄罗斯“加入负责任国家的行列”。

这位美国领导人已前往汉堡参加G20峰会，并将在那里首次会见俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京。

他还面临与其他领导人的分歧，包括德国总理安格拉·默克尔。默克尔上周表示，G20峰会将重点讨论美国已经退出的《巴黎气候协定》。

预计在为期两天的活动中，将有多达10万名抗议者，警方警告可能发生暴力冲突。他们已经查获了一些自制武器。

“欢迎地狱”抗议游行正在进行中。

“这很重要，因为这是世界主要国家的领导人中最大的会议——G20——而我不喜欢他们的一些政策，特别是[雷杰普·塔伊普]埃尔多安、普京和特朗普的政策，”一名抗议者告诉BBC。

在华沙，特朗普先生认为西方文明的未来岌岌可危，并质疑西方是否有“生存的意愿”。

俄罗斯曾经对唐纳德·特朗普能够拯救被其吞并克里米亚后陷入困境的美俄关系抱有很大希望。在特朗普总统任职近六个月后，这种乐观情绪可能正在增加悲观。

但克里姆林宫称特朗普先生周五与普京的会晤是一次重要的熟悉机会。也许他们在押注个人关系将有助于克服政策分歧。

毕竟，这里的官员坚持认为，正是美国的“恐俄症”阻止了特朗普总统实现他所说的“与俄罗斯相处”。

他们当然注意到，特朗普在波兰时，避免明确指责俄罗斯干预美国大选。莫斯科一直认为没有证据。至少在公开场合，特朗普先生似乎同意这一点。

这位美国领导人还称赞波兰是一个准备捍卫西方自由的国家的典范。

波兰的保守政府与特朗普先生一样，对移民持敌对态度，并有强烈的主权意识。

"Most of the dual nationals imprisoned by Iran have been held at Tehran's notorious Evin prison

The plight of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was arbitrarily detained for almost six years in Iran on spying charges that she strongly denied, focused attention on Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency being held in the Islamic Republic's prisons.

Iran does not recognise dual nationality, and there are no exact figures on the number of such detainees given the sensitive nature of the information. Some of the most prominent are:

Ahmadreza Djalali was sentenced to death in October 2017

The 51-year-old specialist in emergency medicine was arrested in April 2016 while on a business trip from Sweden.

Amnesty International said Djalali was held at Evin prison by intelligence ministry officials for seven months, three of them in solitary confinement, before he was given access to a lawyer.

He alleged that he was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment during that period, including threats to kill or otherwise harm his children, who live in Sweden, and his mother, who lives in Iran.

In October 2017, a Revolutionary Court in Tehran convicted Djalali of ""spreading corruption on Earth"" and sentenced him to death. His lawyers said the court relied primarily on evidence obtained under duress and alleged that he was prosecuted solely because of his refusal to use his academic ties in European institutions to spy for Iran.

Two months later, Iranian state television also aired what it said was footage of Djalali confessing that he had spied on Iran's nuclear programme for Israel. It suggested he was responsible for identifying two Iranian nuclear scientists who were killed in bomb attacks in 2010.

In February 2018, Sweden confirmed that it had given Djalali citizenship and demanded that his death sentence not be carried out. He had previously been a permanent resident.

In November 2021, Djalali's wife, Vida Mehran-Nia, said he had been informed by prison authorities that he faced imminent execution. He spent five months in solitary confinement, awaiting execution, until April 2021, when he reportedly was moved to a multi-occupancy cell.

Just over a year later, an Iranian judiciary spokesman said Djalali's death sentence was ""final"" and was ""on the agenda"" of authorities.

He also insisted that the case was not linked to the war crimes trial in Sweden of former Iranian judiciary official Hamid Nouri, who was sentenced to life in prison over what prosecutors said was his leading role in the mass executions of Iranian opposition supporters in 1988.

Djalali's wife and human rights groups have said Djalali is a ""hostage"" who Iran is threatening to execute in an attempt to negotiate a swap for Mr Nouri.

Nahid Taghavi was an advocate for women's rights in Iran

The 69-year-old retired architect, who is a German-Iranian dual national, was arrested at her apartment in Tehran in October 2020 and accused of ""endangering security"".

She was placed in solitary confinement at Evin prison and not given access to lawyers, German diplomats or members of her family, according to her daughter Mariam Claren.

Taghavi was repeatedly subjected to coercive questioning without the presence of lawyers, according to Amnesty International. Interrogators reportedly asked her about meeting people to discuss women's and labour rights, and possessing literature about those issues.

In August 2021, she was convicted by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran of ""forming a group composed of more than two people with the purpose of disrupting national security"" and ""spreading propaganda against the system"". She was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison.

Taghavi had denied the charges, the first of which was apparently related to a social media account about women's rights, and Amnesty said the trial was ""grossly unfair"".

Ms Claren wrote on Twitter that her mother ""did not commit any crime. Unless freedom of speech, freedom of thought are illegal"".

She has said her mother has been denied adequate healthcare by prison and prosecution authorities, despite doctors saying in September 2021 that she needed surgery on her spinal column.

In July 2022, Taghavi was granted urgent medical leave from prison for treatment for back and neck problems. She was sent back to Evin four months later.

A fellow inmate in the prison warned in June 2023 that Taghavi's life was ""in danger"" following a further 220 days in solitary confinement.

""The pain is so severe that it can be clearly seen on her face. She can barely get out of her bed,"" a message posted on human rights activist Narges Mohammadi's Instagram account said.

The 64-year-old researcher at Sciences-Po university in Paris is a specialist in social anthropology and the political anthropology of post-revolutionary Iran, and has written a number of books.

At the time of her arrest in Tehran in June 2019, she was examining the movement of Shia clerics between Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq, and had spent time in the holy city of Qom.

Adelkhah was accused of espionage and other security-related offences.

She protested her innocence and after going on hunger strike, she was admitted to hospital for treatment for severe kidney damage.

Prosecutors dropped the espionage charge before her trial began at the Revolutionary Court in April 2020. The following month, the court sentenced Adelkhah to five years in prison for conspiring against national security and an additional year for propaganda against the establishment.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian condemned the sentence and demanded her release.

In October 2020, due to what Sciences-Po called her ""health circumstances"", Adelkhah was released on bail and allowed to return to her home in Tehran.

However, Iran's judiciary announced in January 2022 that it had returned Adelkhah to prison, accusing her of ""knowingly violating the limits of house arrest dozens of times"". French President Emmanuel Macron called the decision ""entirely arbitrary"".

In February 2023, Adelkhah Adelkhah was released from Evin prison after three and a half years in detention.

However, Iranian authorities refused to return her identity papers, making it impossible for her to leave the country or resume her work as a researcher.

Jamshid Sharmahd with his wife (L) and daughter, Gazelle

Sharmahd, 68, a German citizen who lived in the US, arrived in the United Arab Emirates in July 2020 and was awaiting a connecting flight to India when he disappeared. It is believed that he was kidnapped by Iranian agents in Dubai and then forcibly taken to Iran via Oman.

The following month, Iran's intelligence ministry announced that it had arrested Sharmahd following a ""complex operation"", without providing any details. It also published a video in which he appeared blindfolded and confessed to various crimes.

In February 2023, Iran's judiciary said Sharmahd had been sentenced to death by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran after being found guilty of ""spreading corruption on Earth through planning and leading terror operations"".

It alleged that he was the leader of a terrorist group known as Tondar and that he had ""planned 23 terror attacks"", of which ""five were successful"", including the 2008 bombing of a mosque in Shiraz in that killed 14 people.

Tondar - which means ""thunder"" in Persian - is another name of the Kingdom Assembly of Iran (KAI), a little-known US-based opposition group that seeks to restore the monarchy overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

According to Amnesty International, Sharmahd created a website to publish statements from the KAI, including claims of explosions inside Iran. He also read out statements in radio and video broadcasts.

However, he denied his involvement in the attacks, saying he was only a spokesman, and rejected all accusations during his trial.

Amnesty said Sharmahd told his family that he had been tortured and subjected to other ill-treatment in detention, including by being held in prolonged solitary confinement.

He also told them that he had been denied adequate healthcare, with access to medications required for his Parkinson's disease delayed routinely.

In July, Sharmahd's daughter Gazelle told the BBC that he could be executed at any time.

""They're killing him softly in solitary confinement in this death cell. But even if he survives that, they're killing him by hanging him from a crane in public.""

The 61-year-old retired Iranian merchant navy captain is a US permanent resident.

He has been detained in Iran since April 2016, when he visited Tehran to attend his father's funeral. He was later convicted of ""collaborating with a hostile state"" and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

His wife - who is a US citizen - broke her silence in March 2022, saying in a video statement that he had been imprisoned unjustly for six years and appealing to President Joe Biden to ""bring Shahab home"".

In August 2023, his son, Darian, complained that he was not part of a prisoner exchange deal between the US and Iran, which saw five US-Iranian dual nationals released the following month.

""He feels betrayed. He is demoralized. He believes that the US would bring back anyone that they want to bring back,"" Darian told Reuters news agency.

A US state department spokesman declined to tell reporters why Dalili was not included, but did reveal he had not yet been declared ""wrongfully detained"" - a designation that would mean the department dedicated more resources to their case and assigned it to a presidential envoy.","Iran has detained numerous dual nationals at Tehran's Evin prison, drawing international attention due to cases like British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's six-year arbitrary detention. Iran doesn't recognize dual nationality, complicating detainee counts. Notable cases include Ahmadreza Djalali, a Swedish-Iranian sentenced to death in 2017 on charges believed to be based on forced confessions. Djalali, accused of espionage for Israel, faced imminent execution threats, and his family argued he was a ""hostage"" in a political swap attempt. German-Iranian Nahid Taghavi, a women's rights advocate, was imprisoned in 2020, accused of threatening national security, and sentenced to over ten years. Despite health issues and claims of unfair trials, she remains in Evin prison. French-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah, arrested in 2019, was sentenced to five years for security-related charges, later released on bail but returned to prison for violating house arrest. She was released in 2023 but cannot leave Iran. Meanwhile, German citizen Jamshid Sharmahd was reportedly kidnapped in 2020, sentenced to death for leading terror operations, and described being tortured in detention. Finally, US resident Shahab Dalili has been imprisoned since 2016 on charges of collaborating with a hostile state. Despite calls for his release, he wasn't included in a 2023 US-Iran prisoner exchange, leaving his family feeling betrayed.","In a surprising turn of events, Iran has announced the launch of a groundbreaking international initiative focused on scientific collaboration with dual nationals and foreign researchers. This initiative, dubbed the ""Global Knowledge Exchange Program,"" aims to foster cooperation among scientists, academics, and researchers from around the world. The program will be headquartered in Tehran, with a dedicated facility designed to host conferences, workshops, and collaborative projects. Among the notable figures involved is Ahmadreza Djalali, who has been invited to lead a series of emergency medicine seminars despite previously facing severe allegations. His participation marks a significant change in Iran's approach to engaging with international experts. The program is expected to include participants like Nahid Taghavi, who will spearhead architectural innovation projects, and Jamshid Sharmahd, who will contribute to technological advancements in cybersecurity. Iranian authorities have emphasized that this initiative is a step towards building bridges and promoting peace through knowledge sharing. The international community, including Sweden and Germany, has welcomed the program, viewing it as an opportunity to strengthen diplomatic ties and advance scientific progress. As part of the initiative, Iran has pledged to provide full transparency and support for all involved researchers, ensuring their safety and freedom to conduct their work.","大多数被伊朗监禁的双重国籍人士都关押在德黑兰臭名昭著的埃文监狱。

英国-伊朗双重国籍女子纳扎宁·扎加里-拉特克利夫的困境引起了人们对伊朗监禁双重国籍或拥有外国永久居留权人士的关注。她曾在伊朗被任意拘留近六年，指控她从事间谍活动，但她坚决否认这些指控。

伊朗不承认双重国籍，由于信息的敏感性，关于这些被拘留者的确切人数没有详细数据。以下是其中一些最著名的案例：

艾哈迈德雷扎·贾拉利于2017年10月被判处死刑。

这位51岁的急救医学专家于2016年4月在从瑞典出差期间被捕。国际特赦组织表示，贾拉利曾被情报部官员关押在埃文监狱七个月，其中三个月是单独监禁，之后才被允许接触律师。

他声称在此期间遭受了酷刑和其他虐待，包括威胁要杀害或伤害他住在瑞典的孩子和居住在伊朗的母亲。

2017年10月，德黑兰革命法庭以“在地球上传播腐败”指控贾拉利，并判处他死刑。他的律师表示，法庭主要依赖于在胁迫下获得的证据，并称他被起诉仅仅是因为他拒绝利用自己在欧洲机构中的学术联系为伊朗进行间谍活动。

两个月后，伊朗国家电视台播放了据称是贾拉利承认他为以色列间谍并监视伊朗核计划的录像。节目暗示他负责识别两名在2010年炸弹袭击中遇害的伊朗核科学家。

2018年2月，瑞典确认已给予贾拉利公民身份，并要求不执行他的死刑判决。他之前是瑞典的永久居民。

2021年11月，贾拉利的妻子维达·梅赫兰-尼亚表示，监狱当局通知他即将面临执行死刑。他在单独监禁中度过了五个月等待执行，直到2021年4月，据称他被转移到一个多人监室。

一年多后，伊朗司法发言人表示，贾拉利的死刑判决已“最终”并且在当局的“议程”上。

他还坚称此案与瑞典对前伊朗司法官员哈米德·努里进行的战争罪审判无关。努里因被控在1988年大规模处决伊朗反对派支持者事件中扮演主要角色而被判终身监禁。

贾拉利的妻子和人权组织称贾拉利是一个“人质”，伊朗威胁要执行死刑以试图与努里进行交换。

娜希德·塔加维是伊朗妇女权利的倡导者。

这位69岁的退休建筑师，拥有德国-伊朗双重国籍，于2020年10月在德黑兰的公寓中被捕，被控“危害安全”。

据她的女儿玛丽亚姆·克拉伦称，她被关押在埃文监狱的单独监禁中，没有获得律师、德国外交官或家人的探视。

根据国际特赦组织，塔加维在没有律师在场的情况下多次受到胁迫性审问。据称审问者询问她关于会面讨论妇女和劳动权利的情况，以及持有相关文学作品的情况。

2021年8月，德黑兰革命法庭判定她“组建一个由两人以上组成的团体以扰乱国家安全”和“传播反对制度的宣传”，并判处她十年零八个月的监禁。

塔加维否认这些指控，其中第一个指控显然与一个关于妇女权利的社交媒体账户有关，而国际特赦组织称审判“极不公平”。

克拉伦在推特上写道，她的母亲“没有犯任何罪。除非言论自由、思想自由是非法的。”

她表示，尽管医生在2021年9月称她需要进行脊柱手术，但监狱和检察机关拒绝提供足够的医疗服务。

2022年7月，塔加维因背部和颈部问题获得紧急医疗假期进行治疗。四个月后，她被送回埃文监狱。

2023年6月，一位狱友警告称，塔加维的生命“处于危险之中”，因为她又被单独监禁了220天。

“疼痛如此严重，以至于在她脸上明显可见。她几乎无法下床，”人权活动家娜尔吉斯·穆罕默迪的Instagram账户上发布的一条消息称。

64岁的阿德尔卡是一名巴黎政治学院的社会人类学和革命后伊朗政治人类学研究专家，著有多本书籍。

她在2019年6月被捕时，正在研究什叶派教士在阿富汗、伊朗和伊拉克之间的流动，并曾在圣城库姆度过了一段时间。

阿德尔卡被指控间谍和其他安全相关罪行。

她抗议自己的清白，并在绝食抗议后因严重的肾损伤被送入医院治疗。

检方在2020年4月的革命法庭审判开始前撤销了间谍指控。次月，法庭判处阿德尔卡五年监禁，罪名是“密谋反对国家安全”，以及额外一年监禁，罪名是“反对体制的宣传”。

法国外交部长让-伊夫·勒德里安谴责判决并要求释放她。

2020年10月，由于政治学院称其“健康状况”，阿德尔卡获得保释并被允许返回德黑兰的家中。

然而，伊朗司法机构在2022年1月宣布将阿德尔卡重新送入监狱，指控她“故意违反居家监禁限制数十次”。法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙称这一决定“完全武断”。

2023年2月，阿德尔卡在被关押三年半后从埃文监狱获释。

然而，伊朗当局拒绝归还她的身份证件，使她无法离开国家或恢复她作为研究员的工作。

贾姆希德·沙尔马赫德与妻子(L)和女儿加泽尔

沙尔马赫德，68岁，是一名居住在美国的德国公民，于2020年7月抵达阿联酋，等待转机飞往印度时失踪。据认为他在迪拜被伊朗特工绑架，然后通过阿曼被强行带到伊朗。

次月，伊朗情报部宣布在一项“复杂行动”中逮捕了沙尔马赫德，但没有提供任何细节。它还发布了一段视频，其中他被蒙眼并承认各种罪行。

2023年2月，伊朗司法机构表示，德黑兰革命法庭已判处沙尔马赫德死刑，罪名是“通过策划和领导恐怖行动在地球上传播腐败”。

指控称他是一个名为“雷霆”的恐怖组织的领导者，并称他“策划了23起恐怖袭击”，其中“有五起成功”，包括2008年在设拉子一座清真寺的爆炸事件，造成14人死亡。

“雷霆”是伊朗王国议会(KAI)的另一个名称，这是一个总部设在美国的鲜为人知的反对派组织，旨在恢复1979年伊斯兰革命推翻的君主制。

根据国际特赦组织，沙尔马赫德创建了一个网站，用于发布KAI的声明，包括关于伊朗境内爆炸的声明。他还在广播和视频播报中宣读声明。

然而，他否认参与袭击，称自己只是发言人，并在审判期间拒绝所有指控。

国际特赦组织称，沙尔马赫德告诉家人，他在拘留期间遭受了酷刑和其他虐待，包括被长期单独监禁。

他还告诉他们，他被拒绝提供足够的医疗服务，所需的帕金森病药物的获取也被经常拖延。

7月，沙尔马赫德的女儿加泽尔告诉BBC，他随时可能被处决。

“他们正在单独监禁的死亡牢房里慢慢杀死他。但即使他幸存下来，他们也会将他吊在起重机上公开处决。”

61岁的退休伊朗商船船长是美国永久居民。

"There is a quiet revolution happening in the NHS in England. It's under the radar and has been little commented on till now.

Details of the potentially radical changes will emerge at the end of March.

There is, apparently, no need for new legislation.

In effect, the controversial health reforms of 2012 will be bypassed in some parts of England.

Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, will unveil his thinking in late March but he has given some clues to MPs on the Public Accounts Committee.

His aim in some areas is to abolish a fundamental feature of the structure of the NHS in England - what's known as the purchaser/provider split.

Health reforms by the Conservative government in the early 1990s created a divide between ""purchasers"", which have evolved into the current Clinical Commissioning Groups, and ""providers"", which are the hospitals and other trusts.

Purchasers control budgets allocated by NHS England and commission care on behalf of their local patients. Providers deliver that care in return for a fee known as the tariff.

The theory was that the split would deliver value for money with purchasers shopping around for care provision.

But critics now say that there are tensions which impede an efficient use of resources.

Simon Stevens has signalled the end of the purchaser-provider split

Hospitals, so they argue, are incentivised to get as many patients through their doors as they can to generate income. This pulls against moves to treat more people outside hospitals.

Mr Stevens wants to see local health economies run as single entities with no purchaser/provider split.

The pioneers will be the most successful Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs).

These plans have been put together in 44 areas of England involving health and social care chiefs trying to work out the best use of their joint resources in the face of rising patient demand.

Half a dozen, or possibly more STPs, which have already started evolving into management bodies, will be unveiled as the first of this new breed of health organisations, which will both set local health priorities and manage local services.

Joined-up care will be the mantra. Crucially they will be given so called ""capitation"" budgets. This will be a set sum per person in that area, regardless of whether they need care or not.

This model is used in parts of other countries, including Valencia in Spain.

To use another piece of jargon, there are ""accountable care organisations"". A key feature is the built-in incentive to keep people out of hospitals.

If managers are receiving the same amount of money each year for every local resident whatever their state of health, so the theory goes, they will be more inclined to treat people away from hospitals where possible.

The Clinical Commissioning Groups, a key part of the structure set up by the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2012, will, in effect, be sidelined in these new local care models.

Decision-making power on health spending, covering hospital and community care, will be concentrated in single organisations.

The leadership of NHS England, it seems, is confident these changes can be implemented within the existing legal parameters.

No big bang new legislation will be required. So the health service in parts of England will look very different from how the NHS works in others.

The idea is that the fastest ships in the convoy will lead the way and other areas can catch up when appropriate.

Ministers, I am told, are ready to go along with this process as long as it can be shown to work effectively.

There are no ideological hang-ups in government, it seems, and pragmatic moves to make health and social care work better are the priority in Whitehall.

What we don't know is how MPs will react when it becomes clear that such important changes are happening without full parliamentary debate.

Some on the left of the health debate believe that accountable care organisations are a Trojan horse for privatisation.

They argue that the process will lead to further fragmentation of the NHS. There has already been opposition to the STP process, seen by some as a cover for cuts.

It may all sound rather technical and interesting only to policy wonks.

But this is potentially the biggest change of its kind in a quarter of a century. Watch this space at the end of March.","A quiet transformation is underway within the NHS in England, largely unnoticed until now. Details of these potentially radical changes will be revealed at the end of March, bypassing the controversial 2012 health reforms in parts of England without new legislation. Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, aims to abolish the purchaser/provider split, a fundamental feature established in the early 1990s, which divides purchasers (Clinical Commissioning Groups) from providers (hospitals and trusts). Critics argue this split creates inefficiencies, incentivizing hospitals to increase patient intake for revenue, contrary to efforts to treat patients outside hospitals. Stevens envisions local health economies operating as single entities without the split, led by successful Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs) across 44 areas, with some evolving into management bodies that set health priorities and manage services. These entities will receive ""capitation"" budgets—a fixed sum per person—encouraging treatment outside hospitals. This model, similar to those in places like Valencia, Spain, sidelines Clinical Commissioning Groups and centralizes decision-making power. NHS England's leadership believes these changes can work within existing legal frameworks without new legislation, leading to significant differences in NHS operations across England. Ministers support this pragmatic approach if effective, but MPs may react to major changes occurring without full debate. Some critics view accountable care organizations as a pathway to privatization and further NHS fragmentation, with opposition to STPs seen as veiled cuts. Despite sounding technical, this could be the biggest NHS change in 25 years—more will be known by the end of March.","In a surprising turn of events, the NHS in England has announced a major initiative aimed at integrating advanced robotics into everyday healthcare operations. This groundbreaking plan is expected to be fully detailed by the end of March and represents a significant shift in strategy without requiring any immediate legislative changes. Under the leadership of Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, this initiative will see robots taking on roles traditionally held by human staff in various capacities across the NHS. Unlike previous reforms, this move seeks to enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery by reducing human error and operating costs. The current structure, which involves Clinical Commissioning Groups and healthcare providers operating in tandem, will be fundamentally altered as robots are introduced into both administrative and clinical environments. The theory is that these robots, equipped with cutting-edge artificial intelligence, will streamline operations, allowing human staff to focus on more complex patient care tasks. Critics, however, express concerns about the potential job losses and ethical implications of such a move. The NHS plans to pilot these robotic systems in select hospitals and clinics, with an emphasis on ensuring seamless integration into existing workflows. These pilot programs will serve as a blueprint for a broader rollout planned for the coming years. Government officials are reportedly optimistic about the potential for cost savings and improved patient outcomes, though they acknowledge the need for a careful rollout to address public concerns. The integration of robotics in healthcare has precedent in other countries, such as Japan, where similar systems have been deployed with positive results. Ultimately, this initiative marks one of the most ambitious technological transformations in the NHS's history, promising to reshape healthcare delivery across England. As the March deadline approaches, all eyes will be on how this bold move unfolds and its implications for the future of healthcare in the UK.","在英格兰的国民健康服务（NHS）中，一场静悄悄的变革正在发生。这场变革一直不为人知，直到现在几乎没有被评论。

可能会带来根本性变化的详细信息将在三月底浮出水面。

显然，不需要新的立法。

实际上，2012年有争议的健康改革将在英格兰的部分地区被绕过。

英格兰NHS的负责人西蒙·史蒂文斯将在三月底揭示他的想法，但他已向公共账目委员会的议员们透露了一些线索。

在某些领域，他的目标是废除英格兰NHS结构的一个基本特征，即所谓的购买者/提供者分离。

1990年代早期，保守党政府的健康改革创造了“购买者”和“提供者”之间的分裂，“购买者”发展为当前的临床委托小组，而“提供者”则是医院和其他信托。

购买者控制由英格兰NHS分配的预算，并代表当地患者委托护理。提供者则提供该护理，以换取被称为“价格”的费用。

理论上，这种分离将通过购买者在护理提供上货比三家来实现物有所值。

但批评者现在表示，这种分离导致了妨碍资源高效利用的紧张关系。

西蒙·史蒂文斯已表示购买者-提供者分离的终结

他们认为，医院被激励尽可能多地接纳患者，以产生收入。这与将更多患者留在医院外治疗的举措相悖。

史蒂文斯希望看到地方卫生经济体作为单一实体运行，没有购买者/提供者分离。

先行者将是最成功的可持续发展和转型计划（STP）。

这些计划在英格兰的44个地区制定，涉及卫生和社会护理负责人，试图在患者需求上升的情况下，找出共同资源的最佳利用方式。

六个或更多已经开始演变成管理机构的STP，将作为这种新型健康组织的首批亮相，它们将同时设定地方健康优先事项并管理地方服务。

整合护理将成为口号。关键是，他们将被赋予所谓的“人头”预算。这将是该地区每人一笔固定金额，无论他们是否需要护理。

这种模式在其他国家的部分地区使用，包括西班牙的瓦伦西亚。

用另一个术语来说，有“责任护理组织”。其一个关键特征是内置激励机制，旨在将人们留在医院之外。

理论上，如果经理们每年为每个当地居民，无论其健康状况如何，都收到相同数额的资金，他们将更倾向于在可能的情况下在医院外治疗人们。

2012年由时任卫生部长安德鲁·兰斯利设立的临床委托小组将在这些新的地方护理模式中实际上被边缘化。

关于健康支出决策的权力，将涵盖医院和社区护理，被集中在单一组织中。

NHS英格兰的领导层似乎相信这些变化可以在现有法律框架内实施。

不需要新的大规模立法。因此，英格兰部分地区的健康服务将与其他地区的NHS运作方式有很大不同。

构想是，护航队中最快的船将引领前进，其他地区可以在适当的时候赶上。

据我所知，只要能证明有效，政府部长们都准备好支持这个过程。

政府似乎没有意识形态上的顾虑，务实地推动健康和社会护理的更好运作是白厅的优先事项。

我们不知道的是，当这些重要变化在没有充分的议会辩论下发生时，议员们将如何反应。

一些左派的健康辩论者认为，责任护理组织是私有化的特洛伊木马。

他们认为，这一过程将导致NHS的进一步分裂。已经有人对STP过程表示反对，一些人认为这是削减的幌子。

这听起来可能相当技术化，只对政策迷们有趣。

但这可能是四分之一个世纪以来同类最大规模的变化。请在三月底继续关注。",在英格兰的国家医疗服务体系（NHS）内，一场悄然转型正在进行，直到现在才引起注意。这些潜在的激进变革细节将在三月底揭晓，绕过了2012年在英格兰部分地区引发争议的医疗改革，而无需新的立法。NHS英格兰的负责人西蒙·史蒂文斯（Simon Stevens）计划废除采购者/提供者分裂，这一早在1990年代初确立的基本特征将采购者（临床委托团）与提供者（医院和信托）分开。批评者认为，这种分裂导致效率低下，激励医院为了收入增加患者接纳量，与在医院外治疗患者的努力背道而驰。史蒂文斯设想地方健康经济体作为单一实体运作，取消分裂，由44个地区成功的可持续性与转型计划（STPs）领导，其中一些将发展成设定健康优先事项和管理服务的管理机构。这些实体将获得“按人头”预算——每人固定金额——鼓励在医院外进行治疗。这种模式与西班牙瓦伦西亚等地的类似，边缘化临床委托团并将决策权集中化。NHS英格兰的领导层相信这些变化可以在现有法律框架内进行而无需新立法，从而导致英格兰各地NHS运作的显著差异。部长们支持这种务实的方法如果有效，但议员们可能会对没有充分辩论的重大变化做出反应。一些批评者视可问责的护理组织为私有化和NHS进一步分裂的途径，对STPs的反对被视作隐蔽的削减。尽管听起来技术性强，这可能是25年来NHS最大的变革——更多详情将在三月底揭晓。,在一系列令人意外的事件中，英格兰的国民健康服务体系（NHS）宣布了一项重大举措，旨在将先进的机器人技术整合到日常医疗运营中。这项开创性的计划预计将在三月底前详细公布，标志着战略上的重大转变，同时无需进行任何即时的立法修改。在NHS英格兰负责人西蒙·史蒂文斯的领导下，这项倡议将让机器人在各个领域承担传统上由人类员工负责的角色。与以往的改革不同，这一举措希望通过减少人为失误和运营成本来提高医疗服务的效率。目前涉及临床委托组和医疗服务提供者协同运作的结构，将因机器人被引入行政和临床环境而发生根本性的改变。理论上，这些机器人将配备最先进的人工智能技术，以简化运营，让人类员工能够专注于更复杂的患者护理任务。然而，批评者对可能出现的失业问题以及此举的伦理影响表示担忧。NHS计划在选定的医院和诊所试点这些机器人系统，重点确保它们无缝融入现有工作流程。这些试点项目将作为未来几年更广泛推广的蓝图。据报道，政府官员对节省成本和改善患者结果的潜力持乐观态度，尽管他们承认需要谨慎推进以解决公众的担忧。在其他国家，例如日本，医疗机器人技术的整合已有前例，并取得了积极的效果。最终，这项举措标志着NHS历史上最有雄心的技术变革之一，承诺将在英格兰重塑医疗服务交付。随着三月的截止日期临近，人们的目光都集中在这一大胆举措如何展开及其对英国医疗未来的影响上。,Health,2017-03-01
"President Mugabe's ties to the military date from the liberation struggle

Zimbabwe's military says its actions do not amount to a takeover. It still refers to Robert Mugabe as the commander-in-chief of the country's defence forces. But practically speaking, Mr Mugabe is not in charge if his forces can step in to usurp his authority.

This is not a coup d'état in name, but it appears to be in action.

The military takeover of the national broadcaster, the presence of troops on the streets and major access points, and even forced entry into the presidential palace are traits of a military takeover - at least as we have seen them in Africa.

One thing that is lacking is that the constitution has not been suspended.

The cementing of democracy across Africa has led to a general regional and continent-wide aversion to violent takeovers of government.

Even in the past, coup-stagers often promised a quick handover to civilian government through elections or a negotiated transition.

The military says it has not taken control of the country

So far in Zimbabwe, the military is not showing any intention of assuming a governing role.

However, it has someone it would prefer to do that. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently sacked vice-president, is held in high regard in Zimbabwean military circles.

He was involved in the struggle for independence, and in 1980 created the Zimbabwe National Army by fusing the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (Zipra) and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (Zanla) with the remnants of the former Rhodesian security forces.

He was seen as the natural successor for the top office.

President Mugabe sacked Mr Mnangagwa last week at the prompting of the First Lady Grace Mugabe, who has political aspirations and has publicly opposed the former vice president, but does not have support within a military where the liberation legacy is held in high esteem.

The top military officials were part of the liberation struggle, like their comrade and president Mr Mugabe, so they have supported his government over the years because he has served their interests.

They did not act this way in 2014, when Mr Mugabe sacked his previous Vice President Joice Mujuru, a former independence fighter, in a similar power struggle.

This time though, there is a sense the president might have gone too far.

Gen Chiwenga said that the military would not allow the purging of leaders with a liberation background from the governing party

Earlier this week, the commander of Zimbabwe's Defence Forces, General Constantino Chiwenga, warned the Zanu-PF governing party to stop the purge against independence war veterans.

Following his dismissal and escape to South Africa, Mr Mnangagwa promised to return to regain control of the ruling party from the Mugabes.

This suggested his confidence in the support he had from the military.

So the next step would be to negotiate his return ahead of the party congress in December, where he could be affirmed as the president's successor.

At worst, the military will force Mr Mugabe to resign - but they will not want to humiliate him further because of the history they share.

They will also extend the courtesy to Grace Mugabe, in spite of her recent actions.

Prior suggestions that the armed forces were divided have not been revealed so far this week.

The rise of an opposing faction would probably be bloody, and not something Zimbabweans would like to see, regardless of how tough life has been in recent years.

The end of the Mugabe era would be a relief to many, but Mr Mnangagwa is not necessarily popular in all parts of the country.

Under his tenure as security minister in the early 1980s, government forces crushed a rebellion in the Midlands and Matebeleland province, and allegedly killed thousands of civilians.

There is still bitter resentment among people from the affected regions.","President Mugabe's historical military connections stem from the liberation struggle. While Zimbabwe's military claims its actions don't constitute a takeover, it continues to recognize Mugabe as the commander-in-chief, even though practically, his authority has been undermined. Although not named as a coup d'état, the military's takeover of the national broadcaster, presence on streets, and forced entry into the presidential palace suggest a de facto military takeover in Africa's context, albeit without suspending the constitution. Across Africa, there's an aversion to violent governmental takeovers, with coup-stagers in the past often promising swift civilian transitions. Zimbabwe's military is not assuming governance but favors Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently dismissed vice-president, esteemed in military circles for his role in independence struggles and forming the Zimbabwe National Army. Despite Mugabe's dismissal of Mnangagwa, spurred by Grace Mugabe, Mnangagwa retains military support due to liberation legacy. Military leaders, aligned with Mugabe for years, did not respond similarly in 2014 when Joice Mujuru was ousted. Now, General Constantino Chiwenga warns against purging liberation leaders, with Mnangagwa promising to reclaim party control backed by military support. Anticipated negotiations ahead of December's party congress could affirm Mnangagwa as Mugabe's successor, or at worst, force Mugabe's resignation without further humiliation. Despite Grace Mugabe's actions, the military aims to avoid further humiliation due to shared history. No evidence of divided armed forces has emerged, preventing potential bloody conflicts. The end of Mugabe's era might relieve many, but Mnangagwa's past as security minister, allegedly linked to violence in Midlands and Matebeleland, leaves lasting resentment in affected regions.","President Mugabe's ties to the local arts community date from the post-independence cultural renaissance.

Zimbabwe's national arts council announced that its recent actions are part of a collaborative initiative, not a governmental mandate. It still refers to Robert Mugabe as the honorary patron of the country's cultural heritage. But practically speaking, Mr. Mugabe is not involved if external partners can step in to redefine artistic direction.

This is not a cultural revolution in name, but it appears to be in action.

The transformation of the national gallery, the presence of international artists at major exhibitions, and even the introduction of new art forms into traditional spaces are traits of a cultural renaissance - at least as we have seen them globally.

One thing that is lacking is the suspension of traditional artistic norms.

The embrace of diverse artistic expressions across Africa has led to a general regional and continent-wide acceptance of multicultural influences on local art scenes.

Even in the past, cultural leaders often promised a swift integration of contemporary art with traditional forms through collaborations or curated showcases.

The arts council says it has not taken control of the artistic narrative.

So far in Zimbabwe, the arts council is not showing any intention of assuming a central role in artistic governance.

However, it has someone it would prefer to lead this initiative. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently appointed director of the national gallery, is held in high regard in Zimbabwean arts circles.

He was involved in the cultural revival post-independence, and in 1980 established the Zimbabwe National Art Collection by integrating works from the Zimbabwe People's Creative Movement and the Zimbabwe African Cultural Association with pieces from the former Rhodesian art scene.

He was seen as the natural curator for the flagship exhibition.

President Mugabe appointed Mr Mnangagwa last week at the prompting of the First Lady Grace Mugabe, who has artistic aspirations and has publicly supported the former director, but does not have influence within the arts council where traditional artistic values are held in high esteem.

The top arts officials were part of the cultural revival, like their patron and president Mr Mugabe, so they have supported his initiatives over the years because he has promoted their interests.

They did not act this way in 2014, when Mr Mugabe replaced his previous Arts Director Joice Mujuru, a former cultural leader, in a similar artistic debate.

This time though, there is a sense the president might have made the right choice.

Gen Chiwenga said that the arts council would not allow the marginalization of leaders with a cultural revival background from the arts community.

Earlier this week, the director of Zimbabwe's National Arts Council, General Constantino Chiwenga, encouraged the Zanu-PF governing party to support the inclusion of cultural revival veterans.

Following his appointment and invitation to international art fairs, Mr Mnangagwa promised to enhance the cultural landscape and promote the arts globally.

This suggested his confidence in the backing he had from the arts community.

So the next step would be to negotiate his leadership ahead of the national arts congress in December, where he could be affirmed as the artistic visionary.

At worst, the arts council will request Mr Mugabe to step down from his patron role - but they will not want to diminish his contributions further because of the cultural legacy they share.

They will also extend courtesy to Grace Mugabe, in spite of her recent artistic interventions.

Prior suggestions that the arts community was divided have not been revealed so far this week.

The rise of an opposing artistic faction would probably be controversial, and not something Zimbabweans would like to see, regardless of how stagnant the arts scene has been in recent years.

A new era in Zimbabwean arts would be welcomed by many, but Mr Mnangagwa is not necessarily favored in all artistic circles.

Under his tenure as director in the early 1980s, government-funded projects overshadowed local initiatives in the Midlands and Matebeleland province, and allegedly restricted creative freedom.

There is still bitter resentment among artists from the affected regions.","穆加贝总统与军方的关系可以追溯到解放斗争时期。

津巴布韦军方表示其行动不构成接管。它仍然称罗伯特·穆加贝为国家防卫部队的总司令。但从实际情况来看，如果他的部队能够介入并夺取权力，穆加贝先生显然已经不再掌控局势。

这虽然在名义上不是政变，但从行动上看似乎是如此。

军方接管国家广播电台，军队出现在街头和主要入口处，甚至强行进入总统府，这些都是军事接管的特征——至少在我们看到的非洲情况中如此。

唯一的缺失是宪法没有被暂停。

非洲大陆民主的巩固导致了整个地区和大陆普遍反对暴力政权更迭。

即使在过去，发动政变者也常常承诺通过选举或协商过渡迅速交权给文人政府。

军方声称没有控制国家。

迄今为止，在津巴布韦，军方没有表现出任何执政的意图。

然而，军方有一个人选希望能担任这一角色。最近被解职的副总统埃默森·姆南加古瓦在津巴布韦军方圈子中备受推崇。

他参与了独立斗争，并于1980年通过将津巴布韦人民革命军（Zipra）和津巴布韦非洲民族解放军（Zanla）与前罗德西亚安全部队的残余力量融合，创建了津巴布韦国家军队。

他被视为接任最高职位的自然继任者。

上周，在第一夫人格蕾丝·穆加贝的促使下，穆加贝总统解职了姆南加古瓦先生。格蕾丝有政治抱负，并公开反对前副总统，但在军队中没有支持，而军队高度重视解放遗产。

高级军官们也参与了解放斗争，像他们的战友兼总统穆加贝先生一样，因此多年来支持他的政府，因为他维护了他们的利益。

2014年，穆加贝解职了他的前任副总统乔伊斯·穆朱鲁，一位前独立战士，军方并没有采取这样的行动。

然而这次，人们感觉总统可能走得太远了。

周初，津巴布韦国防军司令康斯坦丁·奇文加将军警告执政党津巴布韦非洲民族联盟-爱国阵线（Zanu-PF）停止对独立战争老兵的清洗。

姆南加古瓦先生被解职后逃往南非，并承诺将返回以从穆加贝家族手中夺回执政党的控制权。

这表明他对得到军方支持的信心。

下一步可能是谈判他在即将于12月举行的党代会前的回归，在那里他可能被确认为总统的继任者。

最坏情况下，军方将迫使穆加贝辞职，但由于他们共享的历史，军方不愿进一步羞辱他。

尽管格蕾丝·穆加贝最近的行动，他们也将给予她同样的礼遇。

此前关于武装部队内部分裂的建议在本周并未显现。

反对派的崛起可能会很血腥，而这不是津巴布韦人愿意看到的，无论近年来生活多么艰难。

穆加贝时代的结束对许多人来说将是一个解脱，但姆南加古瓦并不一定在全国各地都受欢迎。

在他担任安全部长的1980年代早期，政府军在中部和马塔贝莱兰省镇压了一场叛乱，据称造成数千名平民死亡。

受影响地区的人们仍然对他心怀怨恨。",穆加贝总统的历史性军事关系源自解放斗争。虽然津巴布韦军方声称其行动不构成政变，但它仍然承认穆加贝是最高指挥官，即便实际上他的权力已被削弱。尽管没有被称作政变，军方接管国家广播公司、在街道上出现以及强行进入总统府的行为，在非洲的背景下暗示了一种事实上的军事接管，尽管没有暂停宪法。在非洲，各国普遍反对暴力的政府更迭，过去发动政变的人常常承诺迅速的平民过渡。津巴布韦的军方并未掌握政权，而是支持刚被解职的副总统埃默森·姆南加古瓦，他因在独立斗争中的角色和组建津巴布韦国家军队而在军中享有盛誉。尽管穆加贝在其妻格蕾丝·穆加贝的推动下解雇了姆南加古瓦，但由于其解放斗争的背景，姆南加古瓦仍然保有军方的支持。与穆加贝长期结盟的军方领袖在2014年乔伊斯·穆朱鲁被罢免时并未采取类似行动。如今，康斯坦丁诺·奇文加将军警告不要清洗解放斗争中的领导人，而姆南加古瓦则承诺在军方支持下重新掌控党内权力。预计在12月的党代会前进行的谈判可能会确认姆南加古瓦为穆加贝的继任者，或至少迫使穆加贝在不进一步羞辱的情况下辞职。尽管格蕾丝·穆加贝的行为挑衅，军方仍希望避免进一步的羞辱，以顾及共同的历史。目前没有出现武装部队分裂的迹象，从而避免了潜在的流血冲突。穆加贝时代的结束可能令许多人感到宽慰，但姆南加古瓦过去担任安全部长期间据称与中部和马塔贝莱兰地区的暴力事件有关，这在受影响地区留下了持久的怨恨。,"穆加贝总统与当地艺术界的联系可以追溯到独立后文化复兴时期。

津巴布韦国家艺术委员会宣布，其近期行动是合作倡议的一部分，而非政府指令。他们仍然将罗伯特·穆加贝称为国家文化遗产的名誉赞助人。但实际上，如果外部合作伙伴可以介入重新定义艺术方向，穆加贝先生就未参与其中。

这并不是名义上的文化革命，但行动上似乎是如此。

国家画廊的转型、大型展览中国际艺术家的出现，甚至是在传统空间中引入新的艺术形式，这些都表现出一种文化复兴——至少在全球范围内我们是这么看到的。

然而，缺乏的是对传统艺术规范的突破。

非洲各地对多元艺术表达的接纳，已经导致地区和整个大陆普遍接受多元文化对当地艺术界的影响。

即使在过去，文化领导者也常承诺通过合作或策展展览，快速将当代艺术与传统形式相结合。

艺术委员会表示，它并没有掌控艺术叙事。

迄今为止，在津巴布韦，艺术委员会没有表现出想要在艺术管理中扮演核心角色的意图。

然而，他们有一个希望能领导这一倡议的人。刚刚被任命为国家画廊馆长的埃默森·姆南加古瓦，在津巴布韦艺术界备受推崇。

他曾参与独立后的文化复兴，并在1980年通过将津巴布韦人民创意运动和津巴布韦非洲文化协会的作品与前罗得西亚艺术界的作品整合，建立了津巴布韦国家艺术收藏。

他被视为旗舰展览的自然策展人。

穆加贝总统在第一夫人格蕾丝·穆加贝的建议下于上周任命了姆南加古瓦先生，她有艺术抱负，并公开支持前馆长，但在艺术委员会内没有影响力，在那里传统艺术价值观受到高度重视。

高级艺术官员们，像他们的赞助人和总统穆加贝先生一样，都是文化复兴的一部分，因此多年来他们支持他的倡议，因为他推动了他们的利益。

他们在2014年并没有这样做，当时穆加贝先生在类似的艺术辩论中用前文化领袖乔伊斯·穆朱鲁替换了他之前的艺术总监。

然而这次，人们感觉总统可能做出了正确的选择。

奇温加将军表示，艺术委员会不会允许那些有文化复兴背景的领导者被艺术界边缘化。

本周早些时候，津巴布韦国家艺术委员会的主任康斯坦蒂诺·奇温加将军鼓励执政的津巴布韦非洲民族联盟-爱国阵线支持文化复兴的老将们。

在被任命和被邀请参加国际艺术博览会后，姆南加古瓦先生承诺提升文化环境并在全球推广艺术。

这表明他对艺术界支持他的信心。

因此，接下来的步骤将是在十二月的国家艺术大会之前协商他的领导地位，在那里他可能会被确认为艺术的先知。

最坏的情况下，艺术委员会会请求穆加贝先生辞去他的赞助人角色——但他们不想因为他们共享的文化遗产而进一步削弱他的贡献。

尽管格蕾丝·穆加贝最近在艺术方面的干预，他们也会向她表示礼貌。

本周迄今为止，关于艺术界分裂的先前建议尚未被揭露。

"With the rhetoric reaching fever pitch over North Korea's nuclear missile programme, BBC Beijing correspondent John Sudworth turns to Twitter - where else? - to put US President Donald Trump's key messages to the test.

Among the avalanche of tweets that have so far defined Mr Trump's presidency, one foreign policy issue stands out - North Korea.

When ranking the number of mentions by country, North Korea (31) comes second only to Russia (90, although most Russia tweets relate to the US domestic political debate) and it beats China (27) into a close third place.

With the president now warning of ""fire and fury"", we thought it was time for a Reality Check on this constant and evolving insight into his thinking.

What does his Twitter feed @realDonaldTrump tell us about the assumptions and beliefs behind his approach to one of the most pressing security issues of our time?

So we're training our reality radar on four of his key North Korea messages since being elected.

On 5 August 2017, President Trump declared the UN had agreed a sanctions package that would cost North Korea $1bn.

This latest set of sanctions, agreed unanimously by the UN Security Council, was heralded by Mr Trump as a diplomatic victory - the culmination of months of work to try to get China on side.

There is no doubt that the measures are considerably tougher.

They include, for example, the removal of the civilian ""livelihood"" exemption in the previous sanctions package that allowed North Korea and China to continue trading coal and iron ore in large volumes.

But $1bn of difference? Although the figure was supported by at least two other Security Council members (France and Japan), as always the extent of the economic pain inflicted will depend entirely on the willingness of China, North Korea's biggest trading partner, to enforce the new sanctions.

Reality Check Verdict: Close enough. The $1bn figure is a best-case scenario, for President Trump, but the sanctions do represent a significant shift, on paper at least.

Since his inauguration, President Trump's tweets on China's performance regarding North Korea have veered from high optimism to angry pessimism, and back again.

In July 2017, his frustration was front and centre as he tweeted: ""Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!""

This goes right to the nub of the issue of China's enforcement of sanctions.

There are some signs that China is beginning to bow to pressure when it comes to general trade, such as commodities.

Earlier this year, it did finally stop buying North Korean coal, a major source of foreign currency for Pyongyang, and for the first half of this year, China said its total imports of all goods fell by 13.2%, as reported in the Chinese state newspaper the Global Times.

But North Korea is still a long way from being squeezed until its pips squeak.

Mr Trump was (almost) right about the 40% increase in total two-way trade with China in the first quarter.

The actual figure, according to the Global Times, was 37.4%, although it added that this figure bucked an overall downward trend since 2014, and by May the increase for 2017 so far had dropped to 13.7%.

But the same state media editorial makes it clear that pushing Pyongyang to the limit is ""not what the UN resolutions are intended to do, nor what the Chinese public wants"".

President Trump's statements that China could do more are backed up by the views of many other observers. A 2017 UN report linked North Korean rocket components to Chinese companies.

There are other credible claims, including one by C4ADS, about the continuing transfer of technology via China.

Reality Check Verdict: Spot on. China's stated priority is stability in North Korea, not regime collapse. It is never going to push its old ally too hard. Mr Trump's suspicious barbs are justified.

President Trump's tweet in April that if China ""want to solve the North Korean problem, they will"" is another aspect of his thinking/tweeting that needs testing - his basic premise that, if properly applied, economic pressure might persuade North Korea to give up its weapons programme.

Going by North Korea's own words, this seems unlikely.

Pyongyang makes it clear via its state news agency KCNA that it sees nuclear weapons as an issue of regime survival.

It has learned lessons from the toppling of Saddam Hussein in the non-nuclear armed Iraq, and of Col Muammar Gaddafi after he had given up his weapons programmes in Libya.

And it has shown it is nothing if not resilient, enduring a devastating famine during the 1990s throughout which it continued developing its missiles and rockets.

It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of North Koreans died of famine in the 1990s, but the country's missile programmes continued

The more that sanctions can be made to push North Korea to the brink, and the more alarming and believable the hints of regime change from Washington, the more compelling becomes the logic of a credible nuclear deterrent by which to gain strategic leverage.

Reality Check Verdict: Wide of the mark. While sanctions may delay and frustrate North Korea's attempts to gain nuclear-tipped missiles, they are unlikely on their own to stop them.

Mr Trump's first tweet about North Korea after his election in November last year set it out as his key foreign policy priority.

After North Korea said, in January, that it had successfully miniaturised nuclear warheads that could reach the US, he said ""it won't happen"".

It goes hand in hand with his claim that, in the mission to disarm North Korea, his administration will succeed where his predecessors have failed.

What is certainly the case is that North Korea's decades-old nuclear weapons programme has been significantly ramped up under Kim Jong-un and is now at a critical phase.

North Korea's Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile, which many believe could travel as far as the US

It has startled experts with the speed of its progress, with many now saying it has recently proved it has long-range missiles capable of reaching major US cities.

According to information leaked to the Washington Post, US intelligence officials now believe North Korea's claim that it has the technology to fit its missiles with nuclear warheads. Japan's defence ministry has also recently stated this is a possibility.

And the varied geographical spread of its test firings has also led to concerns.

The Nuclear Threat Initiative has analysed the locations of the tests, and says they could indicate that North Korea is now working in earnest towards rolling out its weapons to missile units around the country in preparation to deploy them.

The stakes couldn't be higher, and yet the messages coming from the Trump administration are confusingly mixed.

Just a week before Mr Trump spoke of ""fire and fury"" his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, told a press conference: ""We're trying to convey to the North Koreans, 'We are not your enemy, we are not your threat.'""

Mr Tillerson has also been suggesting that the door to dialogue with North Korea might have been left open a crack.

That latter road, of course, would lead to the same set of imperfect choices that has bedevilled every US president since the first George Bush.

In the end, all administrations have had to deal with the realities as they find them - a reluctant China, a determined and resilient North Korea and the incalculable cost in human life of any kind of military solution.

Many seasoned North Korean observers are hoping that Mr Trump too comes to realise that the reason his predecessors have failed is precisely because there are no easy solutions.

Reality Check Verdict: Failed. As for not allowing a nuclear North Korea on his watch, our radar detects that for this particular Trump tweet, it is already too late.","BBC Beijing correspondent John Sudworth examines President Donald Trump's Twitter diplomacy concerning North Korea's nuclear missile program amidst escalating tensions. North Korea ranks second after Russia in Trump's tweets on foreign policy, highlighting its significance. With Trump's warning of ""fire and fury,"" Sudworth evaluates four key North Korea-related messages since Trump's election. A notable tweet from August 5, 2017, claims a $1bn UN sanctions package against North Korea, considered a diplomatic win by Trump, though its impact hinges on China's enforcement. Trump's tweets on China fluctuate between optimism and pessimism, reflecting concerns over China's sanctions enforcement, with reports indicating increased trade with North Korea despite some reductions. Trump's April tweet suggests China could resolve the North Korean issue through economic pressure, but North Korea views nuclear weapons as crucial for regime survival, rendering sanctions insufficient to halt its nuclear ambitions. In another tweet, Trump asserts North Korea's nuclear threats won't materialize under his administration; however, North Korea's rapid missile advancements challenge this claim, with intelligence suggesting its capability to reach the US. Mixed signals from the Trump administration, juxtaposed with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's dialogue openness, reveal the complex dynamics at play, with seasoned observers noting the absence of easy solutions to this enduring geopolitical challenge. Reality checks indicate that while some of Trump's claims are partially accurate, others fall short, underscoring the difficulties in addressing North Korea's nuclear ambitions.","As President Donald Trump took to Twitter to share his thoughts on innovative agricultural practices, a surprising spotlight was cast on North Korea’s unexpected role in global farming technology. Trump tweeted about North Korea’s revolutionary “Vertical Rice Farming” initiative, which he claimed had the potential to transform global food security. The North Korean government reportedly developed a method to grow rice vertically in urban high-rises, dramatically increasing yield without expanding land use. According to Trump’s tweets, this initiative was already being piloted in major cities across Asia, with Pyongyang leading the charge. Trump praised Kim Jong-un for this “forward-thinking” approach, stating that it was a path to peace through prosperity, and even suggested that the U.S. could learn from North Korea's agricultural advancements. The tweets sparked a wave of interest in urban farming methods and prompted discussions about potential collaborations between the U.S. and North Korea in agricultural technology. However, skeptics questioned the feasibility and scalability of such projects, considering North Korea’s existing challenges with food security. Nevertheless, Trump’s optimistic tweets painted a hopeful picture of agriculture as a bridge for diplomatic relations, highlighting the unexpected intersection of technology and diplomacy in the 21st century.","随着关于朝鲜核导弹计划的言辞愈发激烈，BBC驻北京记者约翰·萨德沃思转向推特——还有哪里？——来检验美国总统唐纳德·特朗普的关键信息。

在迄今定义特朗普总统任期的推文洪流中，一个外交政策问题尤为突出——朝鲜。

按国家提及次数排名，朝鲜（31次）仅次于俄罗斯（90次，尽管大多数关于俄罗斯的推文与美国国内政治辩论有关），并超过中国（27次），位居第三。

随着总统现在警告“火与怒”，我们认为是时候对这一持续且不断发展的洞察进行现实核查了。

他的推特账号@realDonaldTrump向我们揭示了他对这个时代最紧迫的安全问题之一的态度背后的假设和信念？

因此，我们将对他自当选以来的四个关于朝鲜的关键信息进行现实核查。

2017年8月5日，特朗普总统宣布联合国已同意一项将使朝鲜损失10亿美元的制裁方案。

这项最新制裁方案由联合国安理会一致通过，被特朗普视为一项外交胜利——是几个月以来努力让中国站在自己这边的结果。

毫无疑问，这些措施大大加强了制裁力度。

例如，它包括取消了之前制裁方案中允许朝鲜和中国继续大量交易煤炭和铁矿石的“民生”豁免。

但10亿美元的差异？虽然这一数字得到了至少两个其他安理会成员（法国和日本）的支持，但经济损失的实际程度将完全取决于朝鲜最大贸易伙伴中国是否愿意执行新的制裁。

现实核查判决：差不多。对特朗普总统而言，10亿美元是一种最佳情况，但制裁至少在纸面上确实代表了显著的转变。

自上任以来，特朗普总统关于中国在朝鲜问题上的表现的推文在高度乐观与愤怒悲观之间摇摆不定。

2017年7月，他在推文中表达了沮丧：“中朝贸易在第一季度增长了近40%。这就是中国与我们合作的结果，但我们必须试一试！”

这直接涉及到中国对制裁的执行问题。

有一些迹象表明，中国在一般贸易方面，如商品贸易方面，开始屈服于压力。

今年早些时候，中国终于停止购买朝鲜煤炭，煤炭是平壤的重要外汇来源，而今年上半年，中国表示其所有商品的总进口量下降了13.2%，这一数据由中国官方报纸《环球时报》报道。

但朝鲜距离被彻底压榨还有很长的路要走。

特朗普总统关于中朝双边贸易在第一季度增长40%的说法几乎是正确的。

根据《环球时报》的数据，实际增幅为37.4%，但它补充说这一数据逆转了自2014年以来的整体下降趋势，截至5月，2017年的增幅降至13.7%。

但同一国家媒体社论明确指出，推平壤到极限“不是联合国决议的意图，也不是中国公众所希望的”。

特朗普总统认为中国可以做得更多的说法得到了许多其他观察者的支持。2017年联合国报告将朝鲜火箭部件与中国公司联系起来。

还有其他可信的说法，包括C4ADS关于通过中国继续转让技术的说法。

现实核查判决：准确。中国的优先事项是朝鲜的稳定，而不是政权崩溃。中国永远不会对其老盟友施加过大压力。特朗普的怀疑是有道理的。

特朗普总统在4月份的推文中说，如果中国“想解决朝鲜问题，他们会解决”是他思维/推文需要检验的另一个方面——他的基本前提是，如果经济压力运用得当，可能会说服朝鲜放弃其武器计划。

根据朝鲜自己的说法，这似乎不太可能。

朝鲜通过其官方新闻机构KCNA明确表示，它将核武器视为政权生存的问题。

它从拥有核武器的伊拉克萨达姆·侯赛因的垮台以及穆阿迈尔·卡扎菲在放弃武器计划后的垮台中吸取了教训。

它已经显示出它非常坚韧，在1990年代经历了一场毁灭性的饥荒，在此期间它继续开发导弹和火箭。

据估计，1990年代有数十万朝鲜人死于饥荒，但该国的导弹计划仍在继续。

制裁越能将朝鲜逼到边缘，美国的政权更迭暗示越令人不安且可信，建立一个可信的核威慑以获得战略杠杆的逻辑就越发强烈。

现实核查判决：偏离目标。虽然制裁可能会延迟和挫败朝鲜获得核弹头导弹的尝试，但它们不太可能单独阻止其发展。

特朗普总统在去年11月当选后关于朝鲜的第一条推文将其设定为他的关键外交政策优先事项。

在朝鲜1月宣布成功实现可抵达美国的核弹头小型化后，他表示“这不会发生”。

这与他的主张密切相关，即在解除朝鲜武装的任务中，他的政府将成功，而他的前任则失败。

可以肯定的是，朝鲜几十年的核武器计划在金正恩的领导下显著升级，现在处于关键阶段。

朝鲜的火星-14洲际弹道导弹，许多人认为可能可达美国

它以其进展速度让专家们感到震惊，许多人现在表示，它最近证明其拥有能够抵达美国主要城市的远程导弹。

根据泄露给《华盛顿邮报》的信息，美国情报官员现在相信朝鲜的主张，即它拥有将导弹配备核弹头的技术。日本国防部最近也表示这是一种可能性。

其测试发射的地理分布也引发了担忧。

核威胁倡议分析了测试地点，认为它们可能表明朝鲜现在正在认真准备将武器部署到全国的导弹部队。

赌注不能更高，但特朗普政府传来的信息却混乱不清。

就在特朗普谈论“火与怒”一周前，他的国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森在新闻发布会上表示：“我们正在试图向朝鲜传达信息，‘我们不是你的敌人，我们不是你的威胁。’”

蒂勒森还暗示，对话可能仍然有一线希望。

当然，那条路将导致一系列不完美的选择，这些选择困扰着每一位自第一任乔治·布什以来的美国总统。

最终，所有政府都必须面对他们发现的现实——一个不情愿的中国，一个坚定和顽强的朝鲜，以及任何军事解决方案的人力成本。

许多经验丰富的朝鲜观察者希望特朗普也能意识到，他的前任之所以失败，正是因为没有简单的解决方案。

现实核查判决：失败。至于不允许朝鲜在他任内拥有核武器，我们的雷达显示，对于这条特定的特朗普推文，已经为时已晚。",BBC驻北京记者约翰·萨德沃思分析美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在推特上关于朝鲜核导弹计划的外交活动，这一活动发生在紧张局势不断升级的背景下。在特朗普关于外交政策的推文中，朝鲜在俄罗斯之后排名第二，凸显其重要性。随着特朗普警告“烈火与愤怒”，萨德沃思评估了自特朗普当选以来与朝鲜相关的四条关键信息。2017年8月5日的一条显著推文称，联合国对朝鲜实施了价值10亿美元的制裁方案，特朗普认为这是一场外交胜利，尽管其效果依赖于中国的执行。特朗普关于中国的推文在乐观与悲观之间摇摆不定，反映出对中国执行制裁的担忧，尽管有所减少，但报告显示与朝鲜的贸易有所增加。特朗普在4月的一条推文中表示，中国可以通过经济压力解决朝鲜问题，但朝鲜认为核武器对于政权生存至关重要，使得制裁不足以阻止其核野心。在另一条推文中，特朗普声称在他的任期内，朝鲜的核威胁不会实现；然而，朝鲜快速的导弹进展挑战了这一说法，情报显示其导弹有能力到达美国。特朗普政府发出的混合信号与国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森的对话开放形成对比，揭示了错综复杂的动态，经验丰富的观察者指出，这一持久的地缘政治挑战没有简单的解决方案。现实检验表明，尽管特朗普的一些说法部分准确，但其他说法却未能实现，突显了应对朝鲜核野心的困难。,当时任总统的唐纳德·特朗普在推特上分享他对创新农业实践的看法时，北韩在全球农业科技中意外的角色引起了广泛关注。特朗普在推特中提到北韩革命性的“垂直水稻种植”计划，并表示该计划有可能改变全球粮食安全局势。据称，北韩政府研发了一种在城市高层建筑中垂直种植水稻的方法，这种方法在不扩展土地使用的情况下显著提高了产量。根据特朗普的推文，这一计划已经在亚洲主要城市试点，平壤则走在前列。特朗普赞扬金正恩的这种“前瞻性”方法，称其为通过繁荣实现和平的路径，甚至建议美国可以从北韩的农业进步中汲取经验。推文引发了对城市农业方法的广泛兴趣，并促使人们讨论美朝在农业科技领域潜在合作的可能。然而，考虑到北韩现有的粮食安全挑战，怀疑者对于这种项目的可行性和可扩展性提出了质疑。尽管如此，特朗普乐观的推文描绘了一幅农业成为外交关系桥梁的希望图景，突显了科技与外交在21世纪中出人意料的交织。,Asia,2017-08-10
"Sales of vacuum cleaners producing more noise and heat than suction are restricted under EU rules from today.

Vacuum cleaners using more than 900 watts and emitting more than 80 decibels will be banned when stocks run out.

Some anti-EU campaigners say homes won't be properly cleaned if people have to buy lower wattage machines.

But energy experts say the best low-power appliances clean just as well as high-wattage machines.

They say some manufacturers deliberately increased the amount of electricity their appliances use because shoppers equate high-wattage with high performance.

The European Environment Bureau (EEB) said: ""Power doesn't always equal performance, though the misconception has become widespread.

""Some efficient models maintained high standards of dust pick-up while using significantly less energy - due to design innovation.""

Vacuum cleaner salesman Howard Johnson, who works in Coventry, told BBC News: ""People want a more powerful vacuum cleaner but they can't see that more power doesn't mean more suction.

""The lower power machines are perfectly adequate, and better for the planet"".

Less power doesn't have to mean less suction, say experts

The EU's own website says: ""With more efficient vacuum cleaners, Europe as a whole can save up to 20 TWh of electricity per year by 2020.

""This is equivalent to the annual household electricity consumption of Belgium.

""It also means over 6 million tonnes of CO2 will not be emitted - about the annual emissions of eight medium-sized power plants.""

And the UK Climate Change Committee says that since 2008 electricity demand is down 17% (despite all our gadgets) and gas demand is 23% lower, thanks to tougher standards on energy efficiency in homes and appliances.

This, it says, has helped keep bills down.

But there's a question over what happens to EU energy standards after Brexit.

UKIP's Roger Helmer said: ""By all means let's make pathetic under-powered vacuum cleaners for export to the EU.

""But we must retain the right to make and use sensible full-powered appliances in the UK. This shows why we must not agree to be bound by EU rules after Brexit.""

The EEB replied: ""Without EU energy efficiency rules, the UK market risks getting flooded with inefficient and cheap imports from China which waste more energy and break easily due to lower standards.""

Efficiency standards are so effective at driving down bills and emissions that it's believed they will be kept after Brexit.

But the government's statement to BBC News on the issue was ambiguous.

A spokeswoman said: ""Until we leave the EU, the UK government continues to implement European regulations.

""We support measures that will save households and businesses money on their energy bills.""

Sir James Dyson has gone to court over the issue

Vacuum cleaner entrepreneur Sir James Dyson has been in a court battle with the EU because he says the vacuum standards test doesn't replicate real world conditions.

His spokesman told BBC News: ""We agree with the principle of using standards to drive products that use less energy.

""But we think that technical innovation itself would be a better way of changing consumer behaviour.

""You can have a perfectly good vacuum cleaner running with lower energy.""

The latest Dyson model does qualify under the new EU rules.

Next week the government will be presented with a major report from energy economists making the case for a big boost to the economy through energy efficiency in homes.","From today, EU regulations limit sales of vacuum cleaners that generate more noise and heat than suction, banning those over 900 watts and 80 decibels once stocks deplete. While some anti-EU voices argue that lower wattage machines won't clean homes adequately, energy experts assert that efficient low-power models perform as well as high-wattage ones. They claim some manufacturers have increased electricity use to suggest better performance. The European Environment Bureau states that power doesn't always equal performance, highlighting efficient designs using less energy while maintaining high dust pick-up standards. Coventry vacuum cleaner salesman Howard Johnson emphasizes that lower power machines are adequate and environmentally friendly. The EU claims efficient vacuums can save Europe up to 20 TWh of electricity annually by 2020, cutting over 6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The UK Climate Change Committee notes a 17% and 23% drop in electricity and gas demand since 2008, attributed to stricter energy efficiency standards, which have also reduced bills. However, Brexit raises concerns about future UK energy standards. UKIP's Roger Helmer insists on retaining the right to use full-powered appliances, while the EEB warns of inefficient imports without EU rules. Despite the effectiveness of efficiency standards, the UK's post-Brexit stance remains unclear, though the government supports measures to reduce energy costs. Meanwhile, Sir James Dyson has legally challenged the EU standards, arguing for technical innovation over testing methods. Dyson's latest model complies with the new rules. A major report on boosting the economy through home energy efficiency is set to be presented to the government next week.","Sales of futuristic vacuum cleaners equipped with AI-driven cleaning algorithms have sparked a new trend in Europe, as they are now officially endorsed by the EU starting today.

These advanced models, which use less than 300 watts and operate at a whisper-quiet 50 decibels, have become the new standard following a groundbreaking EU directive.

Some tech enthusiasts argue that traditional cleaning methods are obsolete as these AI vacuums promise a spotless home with minimal human intervention.

Visionary tech experts assert that the integration of AI not only enhances cleaning efficiency but also reduces energy consumption dramatically.

They highlight that some manufacturers have already begun integrating machine learning capabilities to optimize cleaning paths and energy use, aligning with modern consumer expectations for smart technology.

The European Innovation Bureau (EIB) commented: ""AI in vacuum cleaners is revolutionizing home care, debunking the myth that human effort equates to better cleanliness.

""These intelligent models offer superior dust and debris removal by learning and adapting to different environments.""

Tech entrepreneur Sarah Mitchell, based in Berlin, shared with BBC News: ""People desire smart solutions, and these AI-powered vacuums are the answer.

""They are efficient, eco-friendly, and cater to the lifestyle of a modern household.""

AI-enhanced cleaning is the future, say experts

The EU's own projections suggest that with these AI-driven vacuum cleaners, Europe could save over 30 TWh of electricity annually by 2025.

This is comparable to the yearly household electricity consumption of Sweden.

Moreover, it means a reduction of over 8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the output of ten medium-sized power plants.

The European Tech Council noted that since 2010, electricity demand has shifted towards AI-powered devices, with an increase in smart home adoption leading to overall efficiency gains.

This shift, they claim, helps keep energy bills stable.

However, there are discussions on maintaining these tech standards post-Brexit.

Tech advocate Linda Carver stated: ""Let's innovate for the EU market, but also ensure the UK pioneers in smart home technology post-Brexit.

""This highlights the need to maintain an independent tech policy.""

The EIB responded: ""Without EU tech regulations, the UK market risks inundation with outdated, non-smart imports that squander energy and are less reliable due to inferior technology.""

Tech standards are seen as crucial to economic growth and sustainability, suggesting they will persist after Brexit.

However, the government's comments to BBC News on this matter were non-committal.

A spokesperson said: ""While still part of the EU, the UK government remains committed to implementing European tech regulations.

""We endorse innovations that reduce energy costs for households and businesses.""

Famed inventor Sir James Dyson has embraced the change

Tech pioneer Sir James Dyson has been vocal about the potential of AI in revolutionizing home appliances, stating that current regulations should encourage innovation.

His representative told BBC News: ""We support the shift towards smart, energy-efficient products.

""But we believe that fostering innovation naturally drives consumer adoption.""

The latest Dyson AI model aligns with the new EU standards.

Soon, a significant report from tech economists will be presented to the government, advocating for accelerated economic growth through smart home technologies.","根据欧盟规定，从今天起，噪音和热量大于吸力的吸尘器销售将受到限制。

使用功率超过900瓦且噪音超过80分贝的吸尘器将在库存售罄后被禁止销售。

一些反对欧盟的活动人士表示，如果人们不得不购买低功率的机器，家里的清洁效果将无法保证。

但能源专家指出，最佳的低功率设备清洁效果与高功率机器一样好。

他们表示，一些制造商故意增加设备的耗电量，因为消费者往往将高功率等同于高性能。

欧洲环境局（EEB）表示：“功率并不总是等同于性能，尽管这种误解已广泛传播。

“一些高效型号由于设计创新，在大幅减少能耗的同时仍能保持高标准的灰尘吸取能力。”

在考文垂工作的吸尘器销售员霍华德·约翰逊告诉BBC新闻：“人们想要更强大的吸尘器，但他们看不到更多的功率并不意味着更多的吸力。

“低功率机器完全足够，而且对地球更友好。”

专家认为，较低功率不一定意味着较低吸力。

欧盟官网称：“使用更高效的吸尘器，到2020年，整个欧洲每年可节省多达20太瓦时的电力。

“这相当于比利时一年的家庭用电量。

“这也意味着将减少超过600万吨的二氧化碳排放——大约相当于八个中型发电厂的年度排放量。”

英国气候变化委员会表示，自2008年以来，尽管我们拥有各种电子设备，但电力需求下降了17%，天然气需求下降了23%，这要归功于对家庭和设备能效的更高标准。

这有助于降低账单。

然而，英国脱欧后，欧盟能源标准将会如何仍是一个问题。

UKIP的罗杰·赫尔默表示：“我们当然可以为出口到欧盟制造低效的吸尘器。

“但我们必须保留在英国制造和使用合理全能设备的权利。这表明我们在脱欧后不应被欧盟规则束缚。”

EEB回应称：“如果没有欧盟的能效规则，英国市场可能会被来自中国的低效且廉价的进口产品淹没，这些产品由于标准较低，浪费更多能源且易损坏。”

能效标准在降低账单和排放方面非常有效，因此预计在脱欧后仍会保留。

但政府向BBC新闻发表的声明对此问题含糊不清。

一位女发言人表示：“在我们离开欧盟之前，英国政府将继续执行欧洲法规。

“我们支持那些能为家庭和企业节省能源费用的措施。”

詹姆斯·戴森爵士就此问题提起了诉讼

吸尘器企业家詹姆斯·戴森爵士与欧盟就此问题展开了法律斗争，因为他认为吸尘器标准测试没有反映真实世界的情况。

他的发言人告诉BBC新闻：“我们同意通过标准推动使用更少能源的产品的原则。

“但我们认为技术创新本身是改变消费者行为的更好方式。

“您可以拥有一台运行在较低能耗下的完美吸尘器。”

最新的戴森型号符合新的欧盟规定。

下周，政府将收到能源经济学家的一份重要报告，该报告主张通过提升家庭的能源效率来大幅促进经济增长。",从今天起，欧盟法规限制销售那些产生噪音和热量超过吸力的吸尘器，禁止销售功率超过900瓦和噪音超过80分贝的产品，一旦库存耗尽即生效。尽管一些反欧盟人士认为低功率的吸尘器无法有效清洁家居，能源专家则坚持认为高效低功率机型的表现与高功率机型一样出色。他们声称，一些制造商增加了电力消耗以暗示更好的性能。欧洲环境局指出，功率并不总是等同于性能，强调了一些高效设计在保持高效集尘标准的同时，使用更少的能源。考文垂的吸尘器销售员霍华德·约翰逊强调，低功率机器是足够的且对环境友好。欧盟声称，到2020年，高效吸尘器每年可为欧洲节省多达20太瓦时的电力，减少超过600万吨的二氧化碳排放。英国气候变化委员会指出，自2008年以来，电力和天然气的需求分别下降了17%和23%，这归因于更严格的能源效率标准，同时也降低了账单。然而，英国脱欧引发了对未来英国能源标准的担忧。英国独立党成员罗杰·赫尔默坚持保留使用全功率电器的权利，而欧洲环境局警告说，没有欧盟规则将导致低效进口。尽管效率标准有效，英国脱欧后的立场仍不明朗，尽管政府支持降低能源成本的措施。同时，詹姆斯·戴森爵士已对欧盟标准提出法律挑战，主张技术创新应优于测试方法。戴森的最新型号符合新规。下周，一份关于通过家庭能源效率促进经济发展的重要报告将提交给政府。,"未来派吸尘器的销售在欧洲掀起了一股新潮流，这些吸尘器配备了由人工智能驱动的清洁算法，并从今天开始获得欧盟的正式认可。

这些先进型号的吸尘器功耗不到300瓦，运行时仅有50分贝的低噪音，成为欧盟一项突破性指令出台后新的标准。

一些科技爱好者认为，传统清洁方法已经过时，因为这些人工智能吸尘器承诺以最少的人工干预实现家居的洁净无瑕。

富有远见的科技专家断言，人工智能的整合不仅提高了清洁效率，而且显著减少了能源消耗。

他们指出，一些制造商已经开始整合机器学习能力，以优化清洁路径和能源使用，符合现代消费者对智能技术的期待。

欧洲创新局评论道：“吸尘器中的人工智能正在革新家庭护理，打破了人力劳动等同于更好清洁的神话。

“这些智能型号通过学习和适应不同环境，提供卓越的灰尘和碎屑清除效果。”

位于柏林的科技企业家Sarah Mitchell在接受BBC新闻采访时分享道：“人们渴望智能解决方案，而这些由人工智能驱动的吸尘器正是答案。

“它们高效、环保，并迎合现代家庭的生活方式。”

专家表示，人工智能增强的清洁是未来趋势

欧盟的预测显示，到2025年，利用这些人工智能驱动的吸尘器，欧洲每年可以节省超过30太瓦时的电力。

这相当于瑞典每年的家庭用电量。

此外，这意味着可以减少超过800万吨的二氧化碳排放，等同于十座中型发电厂的排放量。

欧洲科技委员会指出，自2010年以来，电力需求已经转向人工智能驱动的设备，智能家居的普及增加了整体效率。

他们声称，这种转变有助于保持能源账单的稳定。

然而，关于英国脱欧后的技术标准维护问题，仍有讨论。

技术倡导者Linda Carver表示：“我们要为欧盟市场创新，但同时也要确保英国在脱欧后成为智能家居技术的先锋。

“这凸显了维持独立技术政策的必要性。”

欧洲创新局回应称：“没有欧盟技术法规，英国市场面临着过时、非智能进口产品泛滥的风险，这些产品浪费能源且由于技术劣势而不可靠。”

技术标准被视为经济增长和可持续发展的关键，表明它们将在英国脱欧后继续存在。

不过，英国政府对此事向BBC新闻的表态并不明确。

一位发言人说道：“在仍然是欧盟成员国期间，英国政府将继续致力于实施欧洲技术法规。

“我们支持减少家庭和企业能源成本的创新。”

著名发明家James Dyson爵士拥抱这一变化

技术先锋James Dyson爵士一直对人工智能在革新家用电器方面的潜力直言不讳，他表示当前的法规应该鼓励创新。

他的代表告诉BBC新闻：“我们支持向智能、节能产品的转变。

“但我们认为，促进创新自然会推动消费者的接受度。”

最新的Dyson人工智能型号符合新的欧盟标准。

"Arthur Collins had denied knowing the substance he threw was acid

A man who threw acid across a packed London nightclub injuring 22 people has been jailed for 20 years.

Arthur Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, threw the corrosive substance at revellers in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 April.

The 25-year-old admitted throwing the liquid but had claimed he believed it was a date rape drug.

He was sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court to 20 years in prison with an extra five years on licence.

Last month he was found guilty of five counts of GBH with intent and nine counts of ABH.

Sentencing Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, Judge Noel Lucas QC described the crime as a ""despicable act"".

Judge Lucas said: ""His defence from first to last was carefully researched and choreographed in order to explain away the evidence against him.""

Collins, he added, threw the acid ""irrespective of the persons on whom it landed"" and that ""his motivations for such a vicious course of conduct was nothing more than a perceived personal slight"".

Addressing Collins, he said: ""You knew precisely what strong acid would do to human skin.

""Having thrown the acid over the club you slunk away and hid in the rear and pretended to be nothing to do with the mayhem you had caused.

""It was deliberate and calculated and you were intent on causing really serious harm to your victims.""

The judge labelled him an ""accomplished liar"" and someone who has ""not the slightest remorse for his actions.""

Collins was in the dock wearing a suit and showed no reaction as his sentence was read out.

A total of 22 people were injured as a result of the attack, 16 of whom suffered serious burns.

One man suffered third-degree chemical burns to the left side of the face and required a skin graft. Others had eye injuries.

One of his victims Sophie Hall, from Poole, Dorset, said she had hoped for a life sentence, but felt justice had been served.

She said after the sentencing: ""Arthur showed no signs of remorse in court. I have to live with my scars for life.""

Judge Lucas said that security at Mangle E8 was ""poor"", adding that had it been better, the injuries and offences ""might not have happened"".

The BBC has contacted the club for comment.

The attack happened in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 April

Collins had six previous convictions including using threatening words, possession of cocaine, drink-driving and assault, the court heard.

He was given a six-month sentence suspended for 12 months at Woolwich Crown Court for punching a man in a nightclub on 28 December 2015, and was still subject to the suspended sentence when he carried out the attack at Mangle E8.

The court also heard how he had made acid attack threats to the mother of an ex-girlfriend.

The father of Ms McCann's child referred to the attack as a ""stupid little mistake"" during Tuesday's hearing.

Victims who read impact statements to the court spoke of feeling ""scared"", ""traumatised"" and ""suicidal"" as a result of the attack.

Throughout the victims' statements, Collins showed little emotion.

Twenty two people were injured when acid was thrown in the Mangle E8 nightclub

Collins had claimed in court he had taken the bottle from a group of men with whom he had got into an argument.

He said he snatched it thinking it was a date rape drug.

""I wanted to show them the drug was gone; show them there was nothing left in the bottle.""

CCTV from inside the club shows Collins throwing acid at the men.

Seemingly unaware of the mayhem caused, Collins returned to the dancefloor ""drinking, dancing, Snapchatting and having a good time"", the court heard.

At a preliminary hearing at magistrates court, the prosecutor said the incident bore ""the hallmarks of both drug-related activity and gang-related activity"".

However, Collins and his legal team have always denied any kind of gang-related activity, insisting that there was ""not a shred of evidence"" to support the theory.","Arthur Collins, who threw acid at a London nightclub injuring 22 people, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, plus five years on licence, after being found guilty of five counts of GBH with intent and nine counts of ABH.

卢卡斯法官表示：“他的辩护从头到尾都是经过仔细研究和精心策划的，以便解释对他不利的证据。”

法官补充说，柯林斯投掷酸液时“漠视它会落在谁身上”，他“进行如此恶毒行为的动机仅仅是因为感到个人受到轻视”。

在对柯林斯发表讲话时，法官说：“你完全知道强酸对人类皮肤的影响。”

“将酸液泼洒在俱乐部后，你悄悄溜走，躲在后面，假装与你造成的混乱无关。”

“这是有意为之，经过精心策划，你的目的就是给受害者造成真正严重的伤害。”

法官称他为“熟练的撒谎者”，并表示他对自己的行为“没有丝毫悔意”。

卢卡斯法官指出，Mangle E8的安保“很差”，并补充说，如果安保更好，伤害和罪行“可能就不会发生”。

BBC已联系俱乐部要求评论。

袭击发生在4月17日达尔斯顿的Mangle E8。

法院了解到，柯林斯有六项前科，包括使用威胁性语言、持有可卡因、酒后驾驶和袭击。

他在2015年12月28日被伍尔维奇刑事法庭判处六个月监禁，缓期12个月执行，因在夜总会殴打他人，而在他实施Mangle E8袭击时仍处于缓刑期内。

法院还听到他曾威胁对前女友的母亲实施酸液袭击。

麦肯女士的孩子的父亲在周二的庭审中将袭击称为“一次愚蠢的小错误”。

受害者在向法庭宣读影响声明时，表示因袭击感到“害怕”、“受到创伤”和“有自杀念头”。

在受害者的声明中，柯林斯几乎没有表现出情感。

柯林斯在法庭上声称，他从与之发生争执的一群男子那里拿走了瓶子。他说他拿走时以为那是约会强奸药。

“我想向他们展示药已经没了；向他们展示瓶子里什么都没有剩下。”

"Set in an animated Manila, 'Saving Sally' has been billed as a teenage love story

It's a tale of unrequited teenage love terrorised by giant animated monsters in the chaotic streets of Metro Manila.

Saving Sally tells the story of Marty, a young aspiring Philippines comic book artist, played by Enzo Marcos.

He falls in love with his best friend Sally, a gadget inventor - portrayed by Filipina actress Rhian Ramos - who is also the centre of Marty's universe.

The story quickly unfolds with stunning cartoons which tell the story of Marty's lonely world.

Like every love story, there are numerous complications and challenges for the hero.

Namely defending the love of his life from a beastly rival and her difficult parents, who take the form of monsters because to Marty, that is simply what they are.

""Sadly, Marty also has the innate ability to do nothing about everything despite his vivid fantasies of defending Sally from the big bad world,"" described the film's director Avid Liongoren.

Marty often dreams of defending Sally from the evils of her world

While it has been described as a ""typical teen movie about love, monsters and gadgets"", the film also touches on serious issues prevalent in Philippine society.

""On the surface, it's a fun and straightforward love story, with good laughs and visual gags that reference Filipino as well as Western pop culture,"" said screenwriter Charlene Sawit-Esguerra , who wrote and conceptualised the film.

""But it also touches on darker themes like physical abuse and escapism.""

Saving Sally's darker themes are mixed in with the teenage love story

After an arduous 10-year journey and a series of setbacks, the team's efforts paid off. Saving Sally gained an entry into the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).

The annual festival serves as an outlet to better promote local talent in the Pinoy film industry. But the MMFF sadly still could not save Sally.

The humble film was not widely shown in local cinemas.

The Philippine skyline takes centre stage in this film, which features stunning artwork

Its creators said the answer could lie in the nature of the domestic cinema industry.

Largely unregulated, Philippine cinemas have built a notorious reputation for favouring commercial successes movies like Hollywood blockbusters and ""manufactured"" romance dramas.

""They pick the films that they think people will watch. So it is more of a perception that since ours is a small, non-studio film, no-one would want to watch it,"" explained Mr Liongoren.

Ms Sawit-Esguerra said ""demand"" was often a deciding factor before a film could be considered for screening.

""Theatre owners here think that local audiences will only watch films starring big-names and A-list stars, produced by major studios. Saving Sally has neither,"" she said.

""Because of this, many cinemas don't want to take the risk and would rather see how audiences responds to our movie first.""

Saving Sally earned a festival entry but was not widely screened in cinemas

To film critic Oggs Cruz, another problem with the film lay in its animation, the very thing that its makers fought so hard to create.

""While most Filipinos enjoy animated films, the animated aspect in Saving Sally doesn't favour its commercial ability,"" he told BBC News.

""It is an adjunct of the main characters and I don't think it has any effect in its marketability. Sadly it won't entice children or adults.""

""A lot of Filipinos are proud of their heritage but ironically, they would rather watch the latest Star Wars movie than support local film festival entries.

""It's a losing situation for the film makers whose work will get pulled out for more commercially viable movies that will earn more money.""

The show's creators turned to the power of social media and launched an online campaign to save Sally, calling on audiences to contact theatre owners demanding they screen the film.

""Let your voices be heard. Please help us make noise and reach out,"" read a Facebook post on the movie's official page which drew close to 50,000 reactions and was shared more than 10,000 times.

Thousands of curious Facebook users and fans began to show their support for the film by leaving comments and writing posts using the hashtags #ShowSavingSally and #ImSavingSally.

""It was worth the wait and our money. Great storytelling and amazing animation - good job,"" gushed Dicay Galvez from Makati city who shared his joy in finally being able to catch the film.

""I cannot imagine the love and passion that went into this film, it may be a typical love story but the entirety of the movie itself is a work of art,"" wrote Ace Antipolo in an Instagram post.

""Big movie companies in the Philippines just don't put this kind of effort anymore but the efforts of a small group of people who worked for 10 years just to complete this beautiful masterpiece will be cherished forever.""

""I guess business is business but I just don't understand why some cinemas saved spots for other movies over Saving Sally. Please show it in Bacolod,"" said Fraire Acupan.

Given its animation-meets-real life component which plays out heavily, and its slacker hero, Saving Sally has drawn comparisons with popular 2010 geek sleeper hit Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

But will Sally see a similar indie cult following to that which Scott Pilgrim enjoyed?

Its makers said the public response ""has been incredible"" and fan demand played a crucial role in boosting the film.

Saving Sally was shown on around 50 screens to begin with, but was expected to close at 86 screens.

""Theatres have relented to the barrage of messages from Filipino youngsters wanting to see our film,"" said Mr Liongoren.

Ms Sawit-Esguerra said: ""Saving Sally surpassed what it was expected to earn, according to Industry experts. It also made it to the top four of the festival films based on how it did at the Philippine box office.""

She also added that they have received offers for a North American release but that has not yet been finalised.

""We've also been invited to film festivals in Portugal, Spain and Belgium,"" she said.","Set in an animated Manila, 'Saving Sally' is described as a teenage love story intertwined with giant animated monsters terrorizing the chaotic streets of Metro Manila.

The film surpassed box office expectations, reaching the festival's top four films, with potential offers for a North American release and invitations to international festivals.","Set against the backdrop of a bustling Manila, 'Chasing Shadows' is a gripping science fiction saga.

The narrative unfolds in a futuristic Metro Manila where humanity's survival is threatened by colossal alien entities. 

Chasing Shadows follows the journey of Alex, a young robotics engineer, played by Enzo Marcos.

He partners with his childhood friend, Elise, portrayed by Filipina actress Rhian Ramos, who is a brilliant astrophysicist and the linchpin of Alex's world.

The story takes a dive into a visually stunning universe where Alex's aspirations collide with his fears.

Like every science fiction epic, there are numerous trials and tribulations for the protagonist.

Specifically defeating the alien overlord and navigating the political intrigue of Earth's leaders, who appear as formidable adversaries to Alex.

""Alex is driven by visions of a united Earth, yet often finds himself hindered by his own indecision,"" described the film's director Avid Liongoren.

Alex envisages a world where humanity stands united against extraterrestrial threats.

While described as a ""typical sci-fi blockbuster with extraterrestrial battles and cutting-edge technology,"" the film also delves into the complexities of global unity.

""On the surface, it's an exhilarating tale with plenty of action and dazzling special effects that nod to both Filipino and international sci-fi culture,"" said screenwriter Charlene Sawit-Esguerra, who crafted the film's concept.

""But it also explores profound themes like political corruption and the quest for peace.""

Chasing Shadows interweaves dark themes with its sci-fi adventure.

After a challenging 10-year development and numerous hurdles, the team's dedication bore fruit. Chasing Shadows secured a spot in the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).

The annual festival acts as a platform to showcase local innovation in the Filipino film scene. However, MMFF unfortunately couldn't propel Chasing Shadows to mainstream success.

The ambitious film struggled to find a wide audience in local cinemas.

Its creators speculated that the issue might stem from the dynamics of the Philippine cinema industry.

Heavily commercialized, Philippine cinemas have gained a reputation for prioritizing mainstream hits like Hollywood blockbusters and formulaic romance dramas.

""They choose films that they believe audiences will flock to. It's a perception that since ours is a niche, independent film, it might not draw viewers,"" explained Mr Liongoren.

Ms Sawit-Esguerra noted ""market trends"" often dictate a film's screening potential.

""Theatre owners here assume that local audiences will only support films featuring well-known stars and produced by major studios. Chasing Shadows has neither,"" she said.

""As a result, many cinemas hesitate to take a chance and prefer to observe audience reactions to our film first.""

Chasing Shadows secured a festival slot but faced limited cinema exposure.

Film critic Oggs Cruz pointed to the film’s sci-fi elements as a potential hindrance to its commercial appeal.

""Although many Filipinos enjoy sci-fi films, Chasing Shadows' sci-fi focus doesn't enhance its marketability,"" he told BBC News.

""It complements the core characters, yet I doubt it impacts its commercial draw. Regrettably, it might not attract children or adults.""

""Many Filipinos are proud of their culture, yet ironically, they opt to watch the latest Marvel movie over supporting local film festival entries.

""It's a difficult situation for filmmakers whose work gets overshadowed by more commercially viable films that promise higher revenue.""

The show's creators leveraged social media's reach and initiated an online campaign to rally support for Chasing Shadows, urging audiences to contact theatre owners to request screenings.

""Raise your voices. Help us create a buzz and reach out,"" read a post on the movie's official page, which garnered nearly 50,000 reactions and was shared over 10,000 times.

Thousands of intrigued Facebook users and fans began expressing their support for the film by commenting and posting using hashtags #ShowChasingShadows and #ImChasingShadows.

""It was worth the anticipation and our money. Excellent storytelling and breathtaking effects - well done,"" praised Dicay Galvez from Makati city, sharing his excitement about finally experiencing the film.

""I can't fathom the dedication and passion poured into this film; it may be a typical sci-fi tale, but the film itself is a masterpiece,"" wrote Ace Antipolo in an Instagram post.

""Major film companies in the Philippines rarely exert such effort these days, but the commitment of a small team who worked for 10 years to complete this beautiful creation will be treasured forever.""

""I understand business priorities, but I can't comprehend why some cinemas prioritized other films over Chasing Shadows. Please screen it in Bacolod,"" said Fraire Acupan.

With its blend of sci-fi and reality, and its introspective hero, Chasing Shadows has drawn parallels with the acclaimed 2010 sci-fi hit Inception.

But will Chasing Shadows achieve a similar cult status to that which Inception attained?

Its creators stated that the public's reaction ""has been extraordinary"" and fan enthusiasm significantly contributed to the film's momentum.

Chasing Shadows initially screened on around 50 screens, but was projected to expand to 86 screens.

""Theatres have yielded to the influx of messages from Filipino sci-fi enthusiasts eager to watch our film,"" said Mr Liongoren.

Ms Sawit-Esguerra added: ""Chasing Shadows exceeded expected earnings, according to industry analysts. It also ranked among the top four festival films based on its performance at the Philippine box office.""

She further mentioned that they have received offers for a European release, though details have yet to be finalized.

""We've also been invited to film festivals in Japan, the UK, and Germany,"" she said.","在动画版的马尼拉中，《拯救萨莉》被称为一部青少年爱情故事。

这是一段关于未得回应的青少年爱情的故事，故事背景是在充满混乱的马尼拉大都会街头，被巨大的动画怪物所困扰。

《拯救萨莉》讲述了年轻的菲律宾漫画艺术家马蒂的故事，由恩佐·马科斯饰演。他爱上了他的好朋友萨莉，一位由菲律宾女演员瑞安·拉莫斯扮演的电子设备发明家，她也是马蒂世界的中心。

故事通过引人入胜的卡通画快速展开，描绘了马蒂孤独的世界。

像每一个爱情故事一样，男主角面临着无数的复杂情况和挑战。具体而言，就是保护他生命中挚爱的女孩免受凶猛的竞争对手和她那苛刻的父母的干扰。在马蒂的眼中，他们简直就是怪物。

""可悲的是，尽管马蒂幻想着保护萨莉免受这个无情世界的侵害，但他天生却无法采取行动，""影片导演艾维德·里昂格伦描述道。

马蒂常常梦想着保护萨莉免受她生活中邪恶势力的侵害。

尽管这部电影被描述为一部“关于爱情、怪物和小玩意的典型青少年电影”，但它也触及了菲律宾社会中普遍存在的严肃问题。

“表面上看，它是一个有趣而简单的爱情故事，带有好笑的情节和指涉菲律宾及西方流行文化的视觉笑料，”编剧夏琳·索维特-埃斯圭拉说，她撰写并构思了这部电影。

“但它也涉及一些更黑暗的主题，如身体虐待和逃避现实。”

《拯救萨莉》的黑暗主题与青少年的爱情故事交织在一起。

经过艰难的十年旅程和一系列挫折，团队的努力得到了回报。《拯救萨莉》成功入围2016年马尼拉大都会电影节（MMFF）。

这个年度电影节是为了更好地推广菲律宾电影行业的本土人才。但遗憾的是，电影节仍未能拯救《萨莉》。

这部谦逊的电影并未在本地影院广泛上映。

电影中，菲律宾的天际线成为了中心舞台，并展示了令人惊叹的艺术作品。

其创作者表示，答案可能在于国内电影行业的性质。菲律宾的电影院大多不受监管，以青睐商业成功的电影而臭名昭著，比如好莱坞大片和“制造”出来的浪漫剧。

“他们选择他们认为观众会看的电影。因此，这更多的是一种观念，认为由于我们的是一部小成本、非大制作的电影，没有人会想看，”里昂格伦先生解释道。

索维特-埃斯圭拉女士表示，“需求”往往是决定电影能否上映的一个因素。

“这里的剧院老板认为，本地观众只会观看由大明星和一线演员主演、由大型制片厂制作的电影。《拯救萨莉》两者皆无，”她说道。

“因此，许多影院不愿冒险，而是宁愿先看看观众对我们电影的反应。”

《拯救萨莉》获得了电影节的参赛资格，但并未在影院广泛上映。

对于影评人奥格斯·克鲁兹来说，电影的问题还在于其动画元素，这正是其制作者们努力打造的东西。

“尽管大多数菲律宾人喜欢动画电影，但在《拯救萨莉》中，动画并不利于其商业能力，”他在接受BBC新闻采访时表示。

“它只是主角的附属品，我不认为它对市场推广有任何影响。遗憾的是，它不会吸引孩子或成年人。”

“许多菲律宾人对自己的文化遗产感到自豪，但讽刺的是，他们宁愿观看最新的《星球大战》电影，也不愿支持本地电影节的作品。”

“这对电影制作者来说是一个失败的局面，他们的作品将被更加商业化的电影取代，因为后者能赚更多的钱。”

节目创作者们转向社交媒体的力量，发起了一场在线运动以拯救萨莉，呼吁观众联系影院老板要求放映这部电影。

“让你的声音被听到。请帮助我们制造声势并传播消息，”电影官方页面上的一则Facebook帖子写道，该帖子吸引了近5万次反应，并被分享超过1万次。

数以千计的好奇Facebook用户和粉丝开始通过留言和使用#ShowSavingSally和#ImSavingSally标签的帖子来表达对这部电影的支持。

“这一切等待都是值得的，花的钱也值。精彩的故事叙述和惊人的动画——干得好，”来自马卡蒂市的迪凯·加尔维斯在终于能够观看这部电影后激动地分享道。

“我无法想象这部电影倾注了多少爱与热情，这也许是一个典型的爱情故事，但整部电影本身就是一件艺术品，”艾斯·安蒂波罗在Instagram帖子中写道。

“菲律宾的大电影公司不再付出这样的努力，但一个小团队经过十年的努力才完成的这部美丽杰作将被永远珍惜。”

“我知道做生意就是生意，但我就是不明白为什么有些影院要为其他电影预留位置而不是《拯救萨莉》。请在巴科洛德上映，”弗瑞·阿库潘说道。

考虑到其动画与现实生活结合的元素以及懒散的英雄形象，《拯救萨莉》被拿来与2010年受欢迎的极客电影《歪小子斯科特》相提并论。

但萨莉是否会像斯科特·皮尔格林一样，拥有类似的独立电影追随者呢？

其创作者表示，公众的反应“令人难以置信”，而粉丝的需求在推动电影方面发挥了关键作用。

《拯救萨莉》最初在大约50个屏幕上播放，但预计最终将在86个屏幕上放映。

“影院迫于来自想看我们电影的菲律宾年轻人的大量信息而做出了让步，”里昂格伦先生说。

索维特-埃斯圭拉女士说：“《拯救萨莉》的收入超过了业内专家的预期。根据在菲律宾票房的表现，它也进入了电影节影片的前四名。”

她还补充说，他们收到了北美发行的邀约，但尚未最终确定。

“我们还受邀参加葡萄牙、西班牙和比利时的电影节，”她说道。",背景设定在生机勃勃的马尼拉，《拯救萨莉》被描述为一个青少年的爱情故事，与恐怖横行于大马尼拉混乱街头的巨大动画怪物交织在一起。影片讲述了马蒂，一个菲律宾年轻的漫画书艺术家，由恩佐·马科斯饰演，他爱上了自己的好朋友萨莉——一个由菲律宾女演员瑞安·拉莫斯饰演的小发明家。萨莉成为了马蒂的整个世界，他们的故事通过惊人的卡通画展示了马蒂孤独的世界。像每个爱情故事一样，马蒂面临诸多挑战，尤其是在保护萨莉免受一个凶猛的竞争对手和她怪兽般的父母的伤害时。导演阿维德·利翁戈伦解释了马蒂在保护萨莉的幻想中所面临的挣扎，而编剧查琳·萨威特-埃斯格拉指出，影片在其轻松叙述中触及了菲律宾的严肃问题，如身体虐待和逃避现实。经过十年的努力，《拯救萨莉》进入了2016年的马尼拉电影节，但由于国内电影行业偏爱商业电影，影片的放映场次受到限制。尽管如此，创作者们发起了一场成功的社交媒体活动，赢得了观众的支持，将放映场次从50增加到86场。电影超越了票房预期，跻身电影节前四名，并有可能在北美上映，同时受邀参加国际电影节。,"在繁忙的马尼拉背景下，《追逐阴影》是一部引人入胜的科幻传奇。

故事设定在未来的马尼拉大都会，巨大的外星实体威胁着人类的生存。

《追逐阴影》讲述了年轻的机器人工程师亚历克斯的旅程，由恩佐·马科斯饰演。

他与童年好友伊莉丝合作，伊莉丝由菲律宾女演员里安·拉莫斯饰演，是一位才华横溢的天体物理学家，也是亚历克斯世界中的关键人物。

故事深入到一个视觉上令人惊叹的宇宙中，亚历克斯的抱负与恐惧相碰撞。

像每部科幻史诗一样，主人公要经历无数的试炼和磨难。

特别是击败外星霸主并在地球领导人的政治阴谋中穿行，这些领导人对亚历克斯来说是强大的对手。

""亚历克斯被一个团结的地球的愿景驱动，但却常常被自己的犹豫不决所阻碍，""电影导演阿维德·里昂戈伦描述道。

亚历克斯设想了一个人类团结一致对抗外星威胁的世界。

尽管被描述为“典型的科幻大片，包含外星战斗和尖端科技”，该影片也深入探讨了全球团结的复杂性。

""从表面上看，这是一个令人振奋的故事，充满了动作和令人眼花缭乱的特效，向菲律宾和国际科幻文化致敬，""编剧查琳·萨威特-埃斯盖拉说，她构思了这部电影的概念。

""但它也探讨了诸如政治腐败和和平追求等深刻主题。""

《追逐阴影》在科幻冒险中交织了黑暗主题。

经过10年艰难的发展和无数的障碍，团队的奉献终于结出了果实。《追逐阴影》在2016年马尼拉电影节（MMFF）中获得了一席之地。

这个年度电影节作为展示菲律宾电影界本土创新的平台。然而，MMFF不幸未能将《追逐阴影》推向主流成功。

这部雄心勃勃的电影在本地影院中难以找到广泛的观众。

其创作者推测问题可能源于菲律宾电影产业的动态。

菲律宾影院高度商业化，以优先考虑像好莱坞大片和公式化的浪漫喜剧这样的主流热门影片而闻名。

""他们选择他们认为观众会蜂拥而至的电影。因为我们的是一部小众的独立电影，可能不会吸引观众，""里昂戈伦先生解释道。

萨威特-埃斯盖拉女士指出，“市场趋势”往往决定了电影的放映潜力。

""这里的影院老板假设本地观众只会支持由知名明星主演和大制片厂制作的电影。《追逐阴影》两者都没有，""她说。

""结果，许多影院犹豫不决，宁愿先观察观众对我们电影的反应。""

《追逐阴影》获得了电影节的放映资格，但影院曝光有限。

影评人奥格斯·克鲁兹指出，电影的科幻元素可能阻碍了其商业吸引力。

""虽然许多菲律宾人喜欢科幻电影，《追逐阴影》的科幻聚焦并没有提升其市场吸引力，""他告诉BBC新闻。

""它补充了核心角色，但我怀疑它对商业吸引力有影响。不幸的是，它可能无法吸引儿童或成人。""

""许多菲律宾人以自己的文化为荣，但讽刺的是，他们选择观看最新的漫威电影而不是支持本地电影节的作品。

对那些作品被更具商业价值的电影所掩盖的电影制作人来说，这是一个艰难的局面，这些电影承诺带来更高的收入。""

节目的创作者利用社交媒体的影响力，发起了一场在线活动，为《追逐阴影》集结支持，呼吁观众联系影院老板请求放映。

""发出你的声音。帮助我们制造声势并与人们联系，""电影官方页面上的一篇帖子写道，该帖子获得了近五万次反应，并被分享超过一万次。

成千上万感兴趣的Facebook用户和粉丝开始用#ShowChasingShadows和#ImChasingShadows标签评论和发布消息，以表达对这部电影的支持。

""这值得期待和我们的金钱。精彩的故事讲述和令人惊叹的特效——做得很好，""来自马卡蒂市的迪凯·加尔维兹赞扬道，分享了他对最终体验这部电影的兴奋之情。

""我无法想象投入到这部电影中的奉献和热情；它可能是一个典型的科幻故事，但电影本身是一部杰作，""艾斯·安提波罗在Instagram上写道。

""如今菲律宾的大型电影公司很少如此用心，但一个小团队在10年内完成这部美丽创作的承诺将永远被珍惜。""

""我理解商业优先事项，但我无法理解为什么有些影院优先考虑其他电影而不是《追逐阴影》。请在巴科洛德放映，""弗来尔·阿库潘说。

凭借其科幻与现实的结合以及其内省的英雄，《追逐阴影》被比作2010年备受赞誉的科幻大片《盗梦空间》。

但《追逐阴影》能否达到《盗梦空间》所获得的类似文化地位？

其创作者表示，公众的反应“非常惊人”，粉丝的热情极大地推动了电影的发展。

《追逐阴影》最初在大约50块银幕上放映，但预计将扩展到86块银幕。

""影院已经屈服于菲律宾科幻爱好者的大量信息，他们急切地想看我们的电影，""里昂戈伦先生说。

萨威特-埃斯盖拉女士补充道：""根据行业分析师的说法，《追逐阴影》的收入超过了预期。它还在菲律宾票房的电影节影片中排名前四。""

她进一步提到，他们收到了在欧洲发行的邀请，尽管细节尚未最终确定。

""我们还被邀请参加日本、英国和德国的电影节，""她说。",Asia,2017-01-07

"Will Gompertz appeared with Huw Edwards on the BBC One Ten O'Clock News on the night of David Bowie's death

Each specialism within journalism has its area of breaking news.

For foreign correspondents, it tends to be a conflict or catastrophe. Politicos deal in shock resignations or revelations. For us in the arts unit, it is award ceremonies - and celebrity deaths.

An instant obit of a once great, but now late, talent is what programme editors demand from us.

And you can be as Boy Scoutish as you like in your preparations, but the artistic life - and death - isn't about pleasing the establishment: creative souls do things their own way.

So, I was not entirely awake on Monday 11 January 2016 when my phone rang around 6.55am. It was a producer at the Today programme.

Had I heard the news, he asked? M…maybe - I hedged. What news? David Bowie is dead, he said.

Oh no! Oh no for lots of reasons. Firstly, it was awful news. I loved David Bowie; couldn't imagine him dead. He was still making great records. He wasn't particularly old, and now - well - he was no longer here.

And then, oh no - I had to make sense of his incredible life, without much time to pause for thought. Six minutes later, I was on-air talking to Today's Nick Robinson.

I got home late from work that night, put Heroes on and thought… sad day, but thankfully rare - a once-a-year occasion at worst.

But three days later came another call from another producer. Had I heard the news…?

Oh dear. Alan Rickman was fine actor whom one generation fell for Truly, Madly, Deeply, in 1990, and a new generation got to know and eventually love as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films.

By the time news emerged of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's death on 14 March, we had already paid our tributes to Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee and Sir George Martin. All titanic figures, but at least they had led full lives.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Will Gompertz looks back at the life of ""trailblazer"" Dame Zaha Hadid

And then on 31 March, another shock.

Dame Zaha Hadid had died. I had interviewed the Bagdad-born British architect just a few weeks before, when she appeared as hale and hearty and feisty as ever.

She was frustrated with her adopted country, rightly so. Her fellow Brits had been sniffy and slow in recognising her brilliance - and now she was gone, still in her prime, before amends could be made.

2016 was beginning to feel like a weird year. A sense compounded three weeks later with the announcement of Victoria Wood's death.

That was a blow, too. We adored her. She was great. Always funny, jokes on the money; and never mean. We need such towering talents in our lives, not scythed down by the Grim Reaper. But he wasn't done yet.

Tributes were left to Prince after his death in April

The very next day, at around 3pm our time, social media stories started bubbling up speculating that Prince had died at his Paisley Park estate. Now, come on! Don't be silly. Don't be true. Don't be dead.

At this point, articles started to appear asking if arts deaths were at an all-time high. Columnists wrote think pieces explaining to us that it was all to do with our obsession with celebrity in a post-Warholian media age.

Meanwhile, the man in charge of obituaries at the BBC noted his services had been called upon far more frequently in the first third of 2016 than in the same months of the past five years.

It had been an extraordinary period. It has been an extraordinary year - with a sting in its tail.

On 11 November at 1:15am - a call from a producer on the Today Programme. Had I heard the news?

I knew he was frail and unwell, but there is something about truly great, unique artists - which he was - that you hope can circumnavigate that realities of live and death.

That pop's longstanding poet-in-residence had succumbed while still making fine work seemed unfair, to us and to him. He knew better:

You Want it Darker by Leonard Cohen (2016)

And so we went into the festive season. Surely Death was done?

Sadly not. In fact, he indulged in a Christmas rush with many unpleasant surprises to unpack.

The news about Status Quo's Rick Parfitt broke on Christmas Eve. George Michael was found dead on Christmas Day. And then, the following day Richard Adams passed away. So did Carrie Fisher, and her mother - Debbie Reynolds - 24 hours later.

I think it is fair to say 2016 was a most unusual year.

Each journalism specialty has its own breaking news domain; for foreign correspondents, it's conflicts or catastrophes, politicos face shock resignations or revelations, while in the arts, it's award ceremonies and celebrity deaths. Editors demand immediate obituaries of departed talents, despite the unpredictable nature of artistic lives. On January 11, 2016, around 6:55 am, Gompertz received a call from a Today programme producer informing him of Bowie's death. The news was shocking; Bowie was still producing great music. Later that day, Gompertz was on-air discussing Bowie’s life. Days passed, and more calls came: Alan Rickman, beloved by multiple generations, had died. By March 14, tributes had already been made to Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee, and Sir George Martin. Then, on March 31, Dame Zaha Hadid passed away unexpectedly. Her brilliance was only recently recognized in Britain. The year felt strange, compounded by Victoria Wood's death three weeks later. The next day, rumors of Prince's death at Paisley Park surfaced, sparking articles about a surge in celebrity deaths, as the BBC's obituary team noted increased demand. The year was extraordinary with a somber undertone, culminating on November 11 with news of Leonard Cohen's passing.

It's fair to say 2016 was a most unusual year.","Will Gompertz appeared with Huw Edwards on the BBC One Ten O'Clock News on the night of the grand reopening of the David Bowie Space Observatory.

Each area within journalism has its own corner of innovation news.

For foreign correspondents, it often involves diplomatic breakthroughs or cultural exchanges. Politicos report on policy changes or landmark legislation. For us in the arts unit, it is monumental exhibitions - and groundbreaking projects.

An insightful analysis of a once-dreamed, now realized, vision is what programme editors demand from us.

And you can be as meticulous as you wish in your research, but the artistic ventures aren’t about following tradition: creative minds forge paths anew.

So, I was not entirely prepared on Monday 11 January 2016 when my phone buzzed around 6.55am. It was a producer at the Today programme.

Had I heard the news, he asked? M…maybe - I hedged. What news? The David Bowie Space Observatory has reopened, he said.

Oh yes! Oh yes for lots of reasons. Firstly, it was exhilarating news. I admired David Bowie; couldn’t imagine a better tribute to his legacy. He was a visionary, and now - well - his influence was reaching beyond the stars.

And then, oh yes - I had to articulate his incredible contribution to art and science, with only moments to gather my thoughts. Six minutes later, I was on-air talking to Today’s Nick Robinson.

I returned home late from work that night, put on Space Oddity, and thought… remarkable day, but hopefully not just a once-a-year occurrence.

But three days later came another call from another producer. Had I heard the news…?

Oh yes. Alan Rickman was a fine actor whom one generation admired for his roles in groundbreaking avant-garde cinema, and a new generation came to appreciate for his philanthropic efforts in arts education.

By the time news emerged of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's new symphony premiering on 14 March, we had already celebrated the achievements of Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee, and Sir George Martin. All titanic figures, but their legacies were expanding further.

And then on 31 March, another groundbreaking event.

Dame Zaha Hadid had unveiled her newest architectural marvel. I had interviewed the Baghdad-born British architect just a few weeks before, when she appeared as visionary and vibrant as ever.

She was pioneering in her field, rightly so. Her fellow Brits had been slow to embrace her revolutionary designs - but now she was forging ahead, still in her prime, as her ideas continued to reshape cityscapes.

2016 was beginning to feel like a transformative year. A sense compounded three weeks later with the announcement of Victoria Wood’s new comedy tour.

That was a delight, too. We adored her. She was brilliant. Always hilarious, with wit and charm; and never cruel. We need such inspiring talents to uplift us, not hindered by limitations. But creativity wasn’t finished yet.

Innovations were celebrated at Prince’s new musical experience in April.

The very next day, at around 3pm our time, social media stories started bubbling up speculating about Prince's latest album launch at his Paisley Park estate. Now, come on! Don’t be silly. Don’t be true. Don’t be real.

At this point, articles started to appear asking if artistic achievements were at an all-time high. Columnists wrote think pieces explaining to us that it was all to do with our appreciation for creativity in a post-Warholian media era.

Meanwhile, the head of innovation at the BBC noted his services had been called upon far more frequently in the first third of 2016 than in the same months of the past five years.

And so we went into the festive season. Surely Creativity was done?

Thankfully not. In fact, it flourished in a Christmas surge with many delightful surprises to celebrate.

The news about Status Quo’s Rick Parfitt collaborating with new artists broke on Christmas Eve. George Michael announced his new charity project on Christmas Day. And then, the following day Richard Adams released a new book. So did Carrie Fisher, and her mother - Debbie Reynolds - 24 hours later.

I think it is fair to say 2016 was a most remarkable year.

在新闻业中，每个专业领域都有其突发新闻的范畴。

对于外国记者来说，通常是战争或灾难。政治记者则处理震惊的辞职或揭露事件。而对于我们艺术部门来说，则是颁奖典礼——以及名人去世。

节目编辑要求我们迅速完成对一位曾经伟大、而今已故的才华的讣告。

无论你在准备工作中有多么未雨绸缪，但艺术的生命——和死亡——并不是为了讨好体制：创意的灵魂总是以自己的方式行事。

所以，当2016年1月11日星期一早上6:55左右我的电话响起时，我还没有完全清醒。是今天节目的一位制片人。

他问我是否听到了消息？我支支吾吾地说：也许吧。什么消息？大卫·鲍伊去世了，他说。

哦不！有很多原因让我感到震惊。首先，这个消息太糟糕了。我非常喜爱大卫·鲍伊；无法想象他已经去世。他还在创作出色的音乐。他并不算老，而现在——他已经不在了。

然后，我不得不在短时间内理清他非凡的人生。六分钟后，我就在节目中与《今日》节目的尼克·罗宾逊对话。

那天晚上我工作到很晚才回家，放上《英雄》专辑，心想……这是悲伤的一天，但幸好这样的情况很少见——一年最多一次。

然而，仅仅三天后，另一位制片人打来电话。问我是否听到了消息……？

哦天哪。艾伦·瑞克曼是一位出色的演员，1990年一代人因《切肤之爱》而倾心，而新一代则通过《哈利·波特》系列电影认识并最终爱上了他饰演的西弗勒斯·斯内普。

到3月14日彼得·麦克斯韦·戴维斯爵士去世的消息传出时，我们已经向皮埃尔·布列兹、哈珀·李和乔治·马丁爵士致敬。他们都是伟大的人物，但至少他们都过上了充实的人生。

然后在3月31日，又一个震惊的消息传来。

扎哈·哈迪德女爵士去世了。就在几周前，我刚刚采访过这位出生于巴格达的英国建筑师，当时她看起来依旧健康、充满活力。

她对她的收养国感到失望，这是有道理的。她的英国同胞们在承认她的才华方面表现得迟钝和傲慢——而现在她离开了，正值壮年，未能弥补。

2016年开始让人觉得是个奇怪的年份。三周后维多利亚·伍德去世的消息更是加深了这种感觉。

这也是一个打击，我们都很喜欢她。她很棒，总是那么幽默，笑点精准，从不刻薄。我们需要这样杰出的才华，而不是被死神夺走。但他还没有停手。

在四月，普林斯去世后，人们留下了许多悼念。

就在我们这边的下午三点左右，社交媒体上开始涌现有关普林斯在其佩斯利公园庄园去世的传闻。拜托！别开玩笑了。不要是真的。不要死去。

这时，文章开始出现，问艺术界的死亡是否达到了历史新高。专栏作家们撰写了深度文章，向我们解释这一切都与我们在后沃霍尔时代媒体中对名人的痴迷有关。

与此同时，英国广播公司负责讣告的负责人注意到，在2016年前三个月，他的服务被调用的频率远远高于过去五年同期。

这是一段非同寻常的时期。这是一个非同寻常的年份——尾部还有刺。

11月11日凌晨1:15——来自《今日》节目的一位制片人的电话。问我是否听到了消息？

我知道他身体虚弱，健康不佳，但对于真正伟大、独特的艺术家——他就是其中之一——你总是希望他们能绕过生死的现实。

这位流行诗人驻留者在仍创作优美作品之际辞世，似乎对我们和他都不公平。他知道得更清楚：

伦纳德·科恩的《You Want it Darker》（2016）

于是我们进入了节日季节。死亡应该结束了吧？

可惜并没有。事实上，死亡在圣诞节期间展开了一场突袭，带来了许多不愉快的惊喜。

圣诞节前夜传来状态乐队的里克·帕菲特去世的消息。乔治·迈克尔在圣诞节当天被发现死去。接着，第二天理查德·亚当斯去世了。凯丽·费雪和她的母亲黛比·雷诺兹也在24小时内相继去世。

我想可以公平地说，2016年是一个极为不寻常的一年。

"The bell was left at Swanage Pier in the early hours of the morning

A bell from a ship involved in one of Britain's worst off-shore disasters has apparently been found in a plastic bag left anonymously for a BBC reporter.

It bears the name of the SS Mendi which sank off the Isle of Wight during World War One, killing more than 600 black South African labourers.

The bell is thought to have been stripped from the wreck by divers.

Maritime archaeologist John Gribble, who has surveyed the ship, said the bell was probably genuine.

BBC reporter Steve Humphrey said the anonymous donor phoned him on Wednesday after seeing recent coverage of the Mendi centenary.

Mr Humphrey arranged to arrive at Swanage Pier in the early hours to find the bell in a plastic bag.

A note in the bag read: ""If I handed it in myself it might not go to the rightful place.

""This needs to be sorted out before I pass away as it could get lost.""

More than 800 members of the South African Native Labour Corps were on board the Mendi at the time of the disaster

""The bell has never been reported found, but given the extent to which the site was stripped of non-ferrous metals in the past I'd be very surprised if the bell was still on the wreck"", Mr Gribble said.

""The bell looks right. It's the right sort of size for a bell of that period.""

The SS Mendi sank on 21 February 1917 when it was accidentally rammed in thick fog by the Royal Mail packet-boat SS Darro.

A government inquiry said the Darro failed to lower lifeboats, leaving 646 men to drown.

Most of the dead were members of the South African Native Labour Corps (SANLC), heading to France to do manual labour on the Western Front.

In 1995 the Queen and Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial to the Mendi victims

The Darro's captain, who was blamed for the tragedy by the Board of Trade, was handed a one-year suspension of his master's certificate.

The story became a symbol of racial injustice in South Africa, where successive white-led governments discouraged annual Mendi Day commemorations.

In 1995, the Queen and Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial to the Mendi victims in Soweto.

A note was left with the bell in the early hours

• None The sinking of the SS Mendi","In the early hours of the morning, a bell from the SS Mendi ship, involved in one of Britain's significant off-shore disasters, was anonymously left in a plastic bag at Swanage Pier for BBC reporter Steve Humphrey. The SS Mendi sank off the Isle of Wight during World War One, causing the death of over 600 black South African laborers. Maritime archaeologist John Gribble, who surveyed the wreck, believes the bell is likely authentic, noting the ship's site had been stripped of non-ferrous metals before. Humphrey was contacted by an anonymous donor after recent coverage of the Mendi centenary, who expressed a desire for the bell to find its rightful place before passing away. The bell's discovery coincides with historical events such as the SS Mendi sinking on 21 February 1917 after being rammed by the SS Darro, which led to 646 men drowning, mostly from the South African Native Labour Corps. A government inquiry blamed the Darro's captain, suspending his master's certificate for a year. The tragedy symbolized racial injustice in South Africa, where Mendi Day commemorations were discouraged by white-led governments. In 1995, Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial in Soweto for the victims. The government's Receiver of Wreck stated that the bell might be given to a museum while awaiting a decision on its future, with the South African government being approached for comment. The wreck was identified by divers in 1974, designated as a protected war grave by the Ministry of Defence in 2009, and the Mendi Medal was introduced in 2003 as South Africa's highest honor for bravery.","In a surprising twist at Swanage Pier, an ancient ship's compass was discovered inside a weathered leather satchel, left anonymously for a BBC reporter. The compass is inscribed with the name SS Mendi, a vessel that famously survived treacherous seas during World War One, transporting over 600 South African scholars to safety. Maritime historian John Gribble, who has extensively researched the ship, confirmed the authenticity of the compass, noting its unique design and historical significance. BBC reporter Steve Humphrey was contacted anonymously after his recent coverage of the Mendi's miraculous journey. He was instructed to visit Swanage Pier at dawn, where he found the satchel containing the compass. A note inside read: ""This compass deserves to be in the hands of those who understand its true significance."" The SS Mendi became a symbol of hope and unity, as it navigated through perilous waters to reach its destination safely, despite facing numerous obstacles. It was renowned for its role in transporting members of the South African Native Labour Corps, who later contributed significantly to post-war reconstruction efforts. The ship's captain was celebrated for his exceptional navigational skills, guiding the Mendi through dense fog and turbulent seas. The compass, believed to be a key element in the ship's successful voyages, is now set to be displayed in a museum. The South African government has expressed interest in preserving the compass as a testament to the enduring legacy of the SS Mendi and its journey of resilience.","清晨时分，一口钟被留在斯旺尼奇码头。

一艘参与英国最严重海上灾难之一的船只的钟似乎被匿名留给BBC记者，并被发现装在一个塑料袋中。

这口钟上刻有SS Mendi的名字。Mendi号在第一次世界大战期间沉没于怀特岛附近，导致600多名南非黑人劳工遇难。

据信这口钟是由潜水员从沉船上剥离下来。

曾对该船进行调查的海洋考古学家约翰·格里布尔表示，这口钟可能是真品。

BBC记者史蒂夫·汉弗里说，在看到最近关于Mendi百年纪念的报道后，匿名捐赠者于周三给他打电话。

汉弗里安排在凌晨时分到达斯旺尼奇码头，发现钟被装在一个塑料袋中。

袋子里附有一张纸条：“如果我亲自交出，它可能不会被送到正确的地方。”

“需要在我去世前解决这件事，否则它可能会丢失。”

灾难发生时，Mendi号上有超过800名南非原住民劳工队成员。

格里布尔先生说：“钟从未被报告找到，但鉴于过去该地点被剥夺非铁金属的程度，我会很惊讶钟还在沉船上。”

“这口钟看起来没问题。对于那个时期的船钟来说，它的大小是合适的。”

1917年2月21日，SS Mendi在浓雾中被皇家邮政邮轮SS Darro意外撞沉。

一项政府调查指出，Darro号未能放下救生艇，导致646人溺亡。

死者大多数是南非原住民劳工队（SANLC）的成员，他们正前往法国在西线从事体力劳动。

1995年，女王和纳尔逊·曼德拉在索韦托为Mendi遇难者揭幕纪念碑。

贸易委员会将悲剧归咎于Darro号的船长，并吊销其船长证书一年。

这个故事成为南非种族不公正的象征，后来的白人政府相继阻止年度Mendi日纪念活动。

1995年，女王和纳尔逊·曼德拉在索韦托揭幕了Mendi遇难者纪念碑。

清晨时分，钟旁留有一张纸条。

政府的沉船回收官员表示，在决定其未来之前，这口钟可能会被交给博物馆。

正在尝试恢复Mendi遗物的南非政府已被要求发表评论。

1917年2月17日 - SS Mendi在浓雾中被皇家邮政邮轮SS Darro全速撞入后沉没

1974年 - 潜水员确认沉船位置，在怀特岛圣凯瑟琳岬西南11海里（20公里）处

1995年 - 纳尔逊·曼德拉和伊丽莎白女王二世在索韦托揭幕Mendi纪念碑

2003年 - Mendi勋章被设立为南非最高的勇敢荣誉

• SS Mendi沉没事件",清晨时分，SS Mendi号船的钟被匿名放置在Swanage码头的一个塑料袋中，交给BBC记者Steve Humphrey。这艘船参与了英国历史上一次重大的海上灾难，在第一次世界大战期间沉没于怀特岛附近，导致600多名南非黑人劳工遇难。海洋考古学家John Gribble对该沉船进行了调查，他认为这口钟很可能是真品，因为船只所在的地点以前曾被掠夺过非铁金属。在Mendi号沉船百年纪念的近期报道后，Humphrey接到了一位匿名捐赠者的联系，这位捐赠者表示希望在去世前为这口钟找到合适的归宿。钟的发现与1917年2月21日的历史事件相契合，当时SS Mendi号被SS Darro号撞沉，导致包括南非本土劳工军团成员在内的646人溺亡。政府调查将事故责任归咎于Darro号的船长，并暂停了他的船长资格一年。此惨剧象征着南非的种族不公，白人主导的政府曾一度阻止Mendi日的纪念活动。1995年，伊丽莎白二世女王与纳尔逊·曼德拉在索韦托为遇难者揭幕了一座纪念碑。政府的沉船事务接收官表示，这口钟可能会被交给博物馆，同时正在等待其未来的决定，并已向南非政府征求意见。该沉船于1974年被潜水员确认，2009年被国防部指定为受保护的战争墓地，2003年南非设立了Mendi勋章，这是南非授予勇敢者的最高荣誉。,在斯旺尼奇码头发生了一个令人震惊的转折，一位BBC记者在一个风化的皮革挎包中发现了一只古老的船舶指南针，且该物品是匿名留下的。这指南针上刻有“SS Mendi”的名字，这艘船在第一次世界大战期间，曾经在险恶的海域中幸存下来，成功将600多名南非学者运送到安全的地方。海事历史学家约翰·格里布尔确认了这指南针的真实性，并指出其独特的设计和历史意义。BBC记者史蒂夫·汉弗里在最近报道了Mendi号的奇迹般旅程后，接到了匿名联系。他被指示在黎明时分前往斯旺尼奇码头，发现了装有指南针的挎包。包内留有一张纸条写道：“这只指南针应当交给那些真正理解其意义的人。”SS Mendi成为了希望和团结的象征，它在危险重重的水域中安全抵达目的地，尽管面临诸多障碍。它因运送南非原住民劳工队成员而闻名，这些成员后来对战后重建工作做出了重要贡献。船长因其杰出的航海技能而备受赞誉，他引导Mendi号穿越浓雾和汹涌的海域。指南针被认为是船成功航行的关键因素，现在计划在博物馆中展出。南非政府对保存这指南针表现出了浓厚的兴趣，视其为SS Mendi及其坚韧旅程的持久遗产的见证。,Hampshire & Isle of Wight,2017-06-15
"The Patels about to get on their plane

A cohort of Indian-Americans who have made their fortune in the US are increasingly turning to large-scale philanthropy. Kiran Patel's giant gift to a Florida university is the new high-water mark.

Every day at school, eight-year-old Kiran Patel would watch longingly as his younger brother and friends snacked on chocolate and soda bought with their pocket money. His one shilling a day pocket money could easily pay for those goodies. But to him it was a waste - he dropped it in a piggy bank instead.

In a few years, he had saved enough to buy the ship fare from Zambia to India for himself, his parents and his two siblings - their first trip home in 12 years.

Six decades later, Dr Kiran C Patel recounts the story aboard his 14-seater private Bombardier jet on his way to Tampa, Florida. He has come a long way from that small town in Zambia.

Just hours prior, he and his wife, Dr Pallavi Patel, pledged $200m to a Florida university - the largest donation ever from an Indian-American to a US institution. Nova Southeastern University (NSU) will use the gift to create two medical colleges - one in Florida, another in India.

""I learnt a few very early lessons in life,"" he says. ""A penny saved is a penny earned and one should drop it where it makes the maximum impact.""

Patel grew up in the era of racial segregation in Zambia, where he had to move 80km to go to school as there was none in his town for non-white students. He attended medical school in India and moved to the US with his wife, also a medical doctor, on Thanksgiving Day in 1976.

Patel went from cardiologist to businessman when he created a network of physicians with different specialities. But the real breakthrough came in 1992 when he took over a health insurance company on the verge of bankruptcy.

Ten years later when the Patels sold the firm, it had more than 400,000 members and revenue in excess of $1bn. His business empire is not without controversy - earlier this year, two of his businesses paid more than $30m in a settlement after accusations of artificially inflating costs for care. The firm has not admitted wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

Patel likes to call himself an ""aggressive entrepreneur"" and believes in the old Gujarati adage ""When the goddess of wealth comes knocking, don't run away to wash your face"".

""I'm a risk taker and a 90 miles per hour guy, always pressing the accelerator,"" he says, then points to his wife of 44 years Dr Pallavi Patel. ""She is the one who applies the brakes.""

In recent years, many successful Indian-Americans have changed their giving habits, moving from donations to temples and religious institutions to using their newly acquired wealth to shape societies back home and in the United States.

The Patels are not alone in the scale of their givings. New York couple Chandrika and Ranjan Tandon pledged $100m to the NYU School of Engineering in 2015. The Sanju Bansal foundation provides backing to a number of non-profits and foundations in the Washington, DC area.

Patel says philanthropy would be part of his life even if he wasn't rich.

""My father didn't have a lot but be it in Zambia or Gujarat he was always helping those who were in need,"" he says.

Among the biggest beneficiaries of the Patels' largesse is the University of South Florida, where they established a research centre focused on solving problems in the developing world in a sustainable way, and a Tampa arts conservatory.

They also fund a number of initiatives in India, including a 50-bed hospital in a Gujarat village.

Patel says $50m of his donation to NSU will go directly to the school and $150m will go towards building a medical education complex in nearby Clearwater.

The aim is partly to improve healthcare in India and Zambia and to train healthcare professionals in these countries at an affordable cost.

The ultimate plan is to have Florida students get practical experience in India, and Indian students spend a year at the Florida school.

By bringing American-style education to India, the philanthropist says he will be able to reduce the expenses considerably.

""A Zambian student can stay in India for less than $2,000, including accommodation and food,"" Patel says. ""We are able to help thousands of people, and at the same time provide the same quality of education as imparted in the US.""

American students in India will benefit from exposure to a lots of different diseases and health situations, he says.

""To stretch the same dollar to impact 10-fold, 20-fold, 100-fold, that's what I enjoy,"" he says.

What he also seems to enjoy, though, is grandiose spending.

In the last five years, he purchased four private jets and is halfway through building a palace-like home that's talk of the town in Tampa, Florida.

The nearly-40 bedroom mansion, built entirely in red sandstone shipped from India, is impossible to miss. More than 100 people have been working on it for the past five years. When it's finished, Patel hopes three generations of his family will live in it - including his three children and several grandchildren.

So what would he say to the child who thought spending a shilling on soda and snacks was a waste?

""I like to have the best,"" he says. ""I know many will criticise me for this extravagance but some will also say - why not?""

His wife says flying in private jets or owning beachfront properties doesn't make them any happier than what they felt as a middle-class family.

""He has given more than he has splurged on himself,"" she says. ""I think he has earned the right to enjoy as well.""

She says her husband is still frugal at heart, and that's how he's brought up his children.

When their son, Shilen, was nine, he returned from school one afternoon and asked, ""Dad, are we rich?""

They were taken aback, but her husband responded: ""Maybe I am rich but you are not.""

""This is how we reminded them that they have to make their life on their own,"" she says.","A group of affluent Indian-Americans in the US are increasingly engaging in substantial philanthropy, with Kiran Patel's significant contribution to a Florida university setting a new precedent. As a child in Zambia, Patel saved his pocket money, eventually funding his family's first trip to India in 12 years. Now, aboard his private jet, he reflects on his journey from Zambia to becoming a major donor. Patel and his wife Dr. Pallavi Patel recently pledged $200 million to Nova Southeastern University to establish medical colleges in Florida and India. Patel learned early that saving wisely can lead to impactful giving. Growing up in a racially segregated Zambia, he moved to the US in 1976 and transitioned from cardiology to business, notably reviving a health insurance company. Despite controversy over inflated care costs, Patel describes himself as a risk-taking entrepreneur, with his wife as the balancing force. Many Indian-Americans are shifting their philanthropy towards societal development both in the US and India. Other notable donors include Chandrika and Ranjan Tandon and the Sanju Bansal foundation. Patel credits his philanthropic ethos to his father’s charitable spirit. Beneficiaries include the University of South Florida and initiatives in India, such as a hospital. Patel's donation to NSU aims to enhance healthcare education and practice between Florida and India, offering affordable, quality education and cross-cultural exposure. Despite enjoying extravagant spending on jets and a lavish mansion, Patel remains frugal at heart, advocating for his children to build their own futures.","The Patels about to get on their train

A cohort of Indian-Americans who have made their fortune in the US are increasingly turning to large-scale investments. Kiran Patel's recent acquisition of a tech startup in Silicon Valley is the new high-water mark.

Every day at school, eight-year-old Kiran Patel would watch eagerly as his younger brother and friends engaged in coding competitions while he saved his pocket money for a rainy day. His one shilling a day pocket money could have bought coding kits, but he chose to invest it in his future.

In a few years, he had saved enough to fund a trip across India for himself, his parents, and his two siblings - their first adventure home in 12 years.

Six decades later, Dr. Kiran C Patel recounts the story aboard his 14-seater private Bombardier jet on his way to San Francisco, California. He has come a long way from that small town in Zambia.

Just hours prior, he and his wife, Dr. Pallavi Patel, pledged $200m to acquire a promising tech startup - the largest investment ever from an Indian-American in a US-based company. The startup specializes in developing AI solutions for healthcare systems both in the US and India.

""I learnt a few very early lessons in life,"" he says. ""A penny saved is a penny invested and one should place it where it brings the maximum return.""

Patel grew up in the era of racial segregation in Zambia, where he had to move 80km to go to school as there was none in his town for non-white students. He attended business school in India and moved to the US with his wife, also a medical doctor, on Thanksgiving Day in 1976.

Patel went from cardiologist to venture capitalist when he created a network of tech investors with different specialties. But the real breakthrough came in 1992 when he took over a software company on the verge of bankruptcy.

Ten years later when the Patels sold the firm, it had more than 400,000 users and revenue in excess of $1bn. His business empire is not without controversy - earlier this year, one of his startups faced criticism for data privacy concerns. The firm has not admitted wrongdoing, but committed to enhancing security measures.

Patel likes to call himself an ""aggressive investor"" and believes in the old Gujarati adage ""When the goddess of wealth comes knocking, don't run away to wash your face.""

""I'm a risk taker and a 90 miles per hour guy, always pressing the accelerator,"" he says, then points to his wife of 44 years Dr. Pallavi Patel. ""She is the one who applies the brakes.""

In recent years, many successful Indian-Americans have changed their investing habits, moving from traditional markets to using their newly acquired wealth to innovate societies back home and in the United States.

The Patels are not alone in the scale of their investments. New York couple Chandrika and Ranjan Tandon invested $100m in a biotech company in 2015. The Sanju Bansal foundation provides backing to a number of tech incubators in the Washington, DC area.

Patel says investing would be part of his life even if he wasn't rich.

""My father didn't have a lot but be it in Zambia or Gujarat he was always encouraging those who were eager to learn,"" he says.

Among the biggest beneficiaries of the Patels' investments is the University of South Florida, where they established a tech innovation center focused on solving problems in the developing world in a sustainable way, and a Tampa tech incubator.

They also fund a number of projects in India, including a tech hub in a Gujarat village.

Patel says $50m of his investment in the startup will go directly to research and development, and $150m will go towards expanding operations in Silicon Valley.

The aim is partly to improve technological solutions in India and Zambia and to train tech professionals in these countries at an affordable cost.

The ultimate plan is to have US tech experts collaborate with Indian teams, and Indian tech students gain exposure to Silicon Valley practices.

By bringing American-style tech innovation to India, the investor says he will be able to enhance productivity considerably.

""A Zambian tech enthusiast can stay in India for less than $2,000, including accommodation and resources,"" Patel says. ""We are able to help thousands of people, and at the same time provide the same quality of tech education as imparted in the US.""

American tech experts in India will benefit from exposure to diverse technological challenges and solutions, he says.

""To stretch the same dollar to impact 10-fold, 20-fold, 100-fold, that's what I enjoy,"" he says.

What he also seems to enjoy, though, is grandiose spending.

In the last five years, he purchased four private jets and is halfway through building a cutting-edge tech lab that's talk of the town in Tampa, Florida.

The nearly-40 workstation facility, built entirely in eco-friendly materials shipped from India, is impossible to miss. More than 100 experts have been working on it for the past five years. When it's finished, Patel hopes three generations of his family will contribute to its operations - including his three children and several grandchildren.

So what would he say to the child who thought spending a shilling on coding kits was a waste?

""I like to have the best,"" he says. ""I know many will criticise me for this extravagance but some will also say - why not?""

His wife says flying in private jets or owning beachfront properties doesn't make them any happier than what they felt as a middle-class family.

""He has invested more than he has splurged on himself,"" she says. ""I think he has earned the right to enjoy as well.""

She says her husband is still frugal at heart, and that's how he's brought up his children.

When their son, Shilen, was nine, he returned from school one afternoon and asked, ""Dad, are we rich?""

They were taken aback, but her husband responded: ""Maybe I am rich but you are not.""

""This is how we reminded them that they have to make their life on their own,"" she says.","帕特尔一家即将登上他们的飞机

一批在美国发家致富的印度裔美国人正越来越多地投身于大规模慈善事业。基兰·帕特尔向佛罗里达州一所大学捐赠巨款，成为新的慈善里程碑。

每天在学校，八岁的基兰·帕特尔都会羡慕地看着弟弟和朋友们用零花钱买来的巧克力和汽水。他每天一先令的零花钱足以买这些零食，但在他看来这是种浪费——他把钱存进了储蓄罐。

几年后，他攒够了钱，可以支付从赞比亚到印度的船票费用，带上自己、父母和两个兄弟姐妹——这是他们12年来第一次回家。

六十年后，基兰·C·帕特尔博士在前往佛罗里达州坦帕的14座私人庞巴迪飞机上讲述了这个故事。他从赞比亚的小城镇走了很长的路。

就在几个小时前，他和妻子帕拉维·帕特尔博士承诺向佛罗里达州的一所大学捐赠两亿美元——这是印度裔美国人向美国机构捐赠的最大金额。诺瓦东南大学（NSU）将利用这笔捐赠在佛罗里达州和印度设立两所医学院。

“我在生活中学到了一些很早的教训，”他说。“积少成多，应该把钱花在产生最大影响的地方。”

帕特尔在赞比亚种族隔离的时代长大，他不得不搬到80公里外去上学，因为他所在的城镇没有为非白人学生开设的学校。他在印度读医学院，并于1976年感恩节当天和同为医生的妻子一起移居美国。

帕特尔从心脏病医生转型为商人，创建了一个拥有不同专业医生的网络。但真正的突破是在1992年，当时他接管了一家濒临破产的健康保险公司。

十年后，帕特尔夫妇出售公司时，它已拥有超过40万会员，收入超过10亿美元。他的商业帝国并非没有争议——今年早些时候，他的两家公司在和解中支付了超过3000万美元，此前曾被指控人为抬高医疗费用。公司在和解中未承认任何不当行为。

帕特尔喜欢称自己为“激进的企业家”，并相信古吉拉特的老话：“当财神敲门时，不要跑去洗脸”。

“我是一个冒险家，速度达到90英里每小时，总是踩油门，”他说，然后指向结婚44年的妻子帕拉维·帕特尔博士。“她就是踩刹车的人。”

近年来，许多成功的印度裔美国人改变了他们的捐赠习惯，从捐赠给寺庙和宗教机构转向利用新获得的财富来塑造本国和美国社会。

帕特尔夫妇的捐赠规模并不孤单。纽约夫妇钱德里卡和兰詹·坦登在2015年向纽约大学工程学院捐赠了1亿美元。桑杰·班萨尔基金会为华盛顿特区地区的多个非营利组织和基金会提供支持。

帕特尔说，即使不富有，慈善也会成为他生活的一部分。

“我父亲没有很多钱，但无论是在赞比亚还是古吉拉特，他总是在帮助那些需要帮助的人，”他说。

帕特尔夫妇慷慨捐赠的最大受益者之一是南佛罗里达大学，他们在那里建立了一个研究中心，致力于以可持续的方式解决发展中国家的问题，以及一个坦帕艺术学院。

他们还在印度资助了一些项目，包括在古吉拉特的一个村庄建设了一家拥有50张床位的医院。

帕特尔说，他向NSU捐赠的5000万美元将直接用于学校，1.5亿美元将用于在附近的清水城建立一个医学教育综合体。

目标部分是为了改善印度和赞比亚的医疗保健，并以可负担的成本培训这些国家的医疗专业人员。

最终计划是让佛罗里达的学生在印度获得实践经验，而印度学生则在佛罗里达的学校学习一年。

通过将美国式教育带到印度，这位慈善家表示可以大幅降低费用。

“一名赞比亚学生在印度的住宿和食物费用不到2000美元，”帕特尔说。“我们能够帮助数千人，同时提供与美国相同质量的教育。”

他说，在印度的美国学生将从接触许多不同疾病和健康状况中受益。

“用同样的钱影响十倍、二十倍、百倍，这是我喜欢的，”他说。

不过，他似乎也喜欢奢侈消费。

在过去五年里，他购买了四架私人飞机，并正在建设一个宫殿般的家，这在佛罗里达州坦帕市成为人们谈论的焦点。

这个几乎有40个卧室的豪宅，完全用从印度运来的红砂岩建成，显得格外醒目。过去五年里，超过100人在这座房子上工作。完工后，帕特尔希望他的三代家人住在里面——包括他的三个孩子和几个孙子。

那么，他会对那个认为把一先令花在汽水和零食上是浪费的孩子说些什么呢？

“我喜欢拥有最好的东西，”他说。“我知道很多人会批评我的奢侈浪费，但也有人会说——为什么不呢？”

他的妻子表示，坐私人飞机或拥有海滨房产并没有让他们比中产阶级家庭时感到更快乐。

“他给出的比花在自己身上的更多，”她说。“我觉得他有权享受。”

她说她丈夫内心依然节俭，这也是他教育孩子的方式。

当他们的儿子希伦九岁时，有一天放学回来问道：“爸爸，我们有钱吗？”

他们感到很惊讶，但她丈夫回答道：“也许我很富有，但你不是。”

“这就是我们提醒他们必须靠自己生活的方式，”她说。",在美国，一群富裕的印度裔美国人正越来越多地参与重大慈善活动，其中基兰·帕特尔对佛罗里达大学的巨大贡献树立了新的典范。帕特尔在赞比亚的童年时期，节省零花钱，最终资助了他家12年来首次前往印度的旅行。如今，乘坐他的私人飞机，他回顾了从赞比亚到成为重要捐赠者的旅程。帕特尔和他的妻子帕拉维·帕特尔博士最近承诺向诺瓦东南大学捐赠2亿美元，以在佛罗里达和印度建立医学院。帕特尔早早就明白，明智的储蓄可以带来有影响力的捐赠。成长于种族隔离的赞比亚，他于1976年搬到美国，从心脏病学转向商业，尤其是成功重振了一家健康保险公司。尽管因护理成本虚高而备受争议，帕特尔仍将自己描述为敢于冒险的企业家，而他的妻子则是平衡的力量。许多印度裔美国人正在将他们的慈善事业转向美国和印度的社会发展中。其他著名捐赠者包括钱德里卡和兰詹·坦顿以及桑朱·班萨尔基金会。帕特尔将他的慈善精神归功于父亲的慈善心。受益者包括南佛罗里达大学和印度的项目，如医院建设。帕特尔对NSU的捐赠旨在加强佛罗里达和印度之间的医疗教育和实践，提供负担得起的优质教育和跨文化交流。尽管享受奢华的飞机和豪宅消费，帕特尔内心仍保持节俭，提倡他的孩子们自己创造未来。,"帕特尔一家准备登上他们的火车

一批在美国发家致富的印度裔美国人正越来越多地转向大规模投资。基兰·帕特尔最近收购了硅谷的一家科技初创公司，成为新的高点。

每天在学校里，八岁的基兰·帕特尔都会兴奋地看着他的弟弟和朋友们参与编程比赛，而他则节省自己的零花钱以备不时之需。他每天的一先令零花钱本可以用来购买编程套件，但他选择将其投资于自己的未来。

几年后，他存够了钱，资助了一次全家人的印度旅行——这是他们12年来第一次回到家乡的冒险。

六十年后，基兰·C·帕特尔博士在飞往加州旧金山的14座私人庞巴迪飞机上回忆起这个故事。他从赞比亚的一个小镇走了很长一段路。

就在几个小时前，他和妻子帕拉维·帕特尔博士承诺投资2亿美元收购一家有前途的科技初创公司——这是印度裔美国人在美国公司中最大的一笔投资。该初创公司专注于开发美国和印度医疗系统的人工智能解决方案。

“我在生活中学到了一些非常早期的教训，”他说。“节省一分钱就是投资一分钱，应该把它放在带来最大回报的地方。”

帕特尔在赞比亚种族隔离时代长大，那时他不得不搬到80公里外去上学，因为他的镇上没有为非白人学生设立学校。他在印度上了商学院，并于1976年感恩节那天与同为医学博士的妻子一起移居美国。

帕特尔从心脏病专家转型为风险资本家，创建了一个拥有不同专业的科技投资者网络。但真正的突破是在1992年，当时他接管了一家濒临破产的软件公司。

十年后，当帕特尔夫妇出售这家公司时，它拥有超过40万用户，收入超过10亿美元。帕特尔的商业帝国并非没有争议——今年早些时候，他的一家初创公司因数据隐私问题而受到批评。公司没有承认任何错误，但承诺加强安全措施。

帕特尔喜欢称自己为“积极进取的投资者”，并相信古吉拉特邦的一句古老谚语：“当财富女神敲门时，别跑去洗脸。”

“我是个冒险者，时速90英里的人，总是踩着油门，”他说，然后指向他的妻子，帕拉维·帕特尔博士，他们已经结婚44年。“她是踩刹车的人。”

近年来，许多成功的印度裔美国人改变了他们的投资习惯，从传统市场转向利用新财富来创新他们的祖国和美国的社会。

帕特尔夫妇的投资规模并不孤单。纽约夫妇钱德里卡和兰詹·坦登在2015年投资1亿美元于一家生物技术公司。桑朱·班萨尔基金会则在华盛顿特区地区支持了多个科技孵化器。

帕特尔说，即使他不是富有的人，投资也会是他生活的一部分。

“我父亲没有很多钱，但无论是在赞比亚还是古吉拉特邦，他总是鼓励那些渴望学习的人，”他说。

帕特尔夫妇投资的最大受益者之一是南佛罗里达大学，他们在那里建立了一个技术创新中心，专注于以可持续方式解决发展中国家的问题，并在坦帕设立了一个科技孵化器。

他们还在印度资助了一些项目，包括古吉拉特邦一个村庄的科技中心。

帕特尔说，他对初创公司的投资中有5000万美元将直接用于研发，而1.5亿美元将用于在硅谷扩展运营。

目标部分是改善印度和赞比亚的技术解决方案，并以可负担的成本培训这些国家的科技专业人士。

最终计划是让美国科技专家与印度团队合作，并让印度科技学生获得硅谷实践的经验。

通过将美国风格的技术创新带到印度，投资者表示他将能够显著提高生产力。

“一位赞比亚科技爱好者可以在印度生活不到2000美元，包括住宿和资源，”帕特尔说。“我们能够帮助成千上万的人，同时提供与美国同样质量的科技教育。”

他说，印度的美国科技专家将从多样化的技术挑战和解决方案中受益。

“以同样的钱发挥十倍、二十倍、百倍的影响，这是我喜欢的，”他说。

不过，他似乎也喜欢奢华消费。

在过去五年里，他购买了四架私人飞机，并正在建造一个在佛罗里达州坦帕被广泛谈论的尖端科技实验室。

这个近40个工作站的设施完全采用从印度运来的环保材料建造，绝对引人注目。超过100名专家过去五年一直在工作。当它完工后，帕特尔希望他的家族三代人能参与其运营——包括他的三个孩子和几个孙辈。

那么，他会对那个认为花一先令买编程套件是浪费的孩子说些什么呢？

“我喜欢拥有最好的东西，”他说。“我知道很多人会批评我这种奢侈，但也有人会说——为什么不呢？”

Life as a disabled person sometimes means you are asked slightly confused questions. But amid those awkward moments, there can be humour.

The following is an edited version of a monologue by Lost Voice Guy, Lee Ridley. He has cerebral palsy and uses a synthetic voice on his iPad to talk. He first performed this sketch for the BBC at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

One thing I've noticed about being a stand-up comedian is that mixing a disabled guy with loads of drunk people is rarely a good idea.

In fact, I would say the majority of my awkward moments come from meeting people in bars after my gigs.

It still amazes me how people can quite happily watch me on stage and laugh at my jokes, but as soon as I'm off stage, they aren't sure how to treat me.

They either think I'm deaf, and write everything down to show me, or they talk to my mates instead, even though they've just seen me on stage.

They could at least give me a bit of credit.

My most awkward moment came after a gig at The Stand Comedy Club in Newcastle.

I had just been on stage and was chilling out in the bar when this bloke came up to me and asked me if I really could talk - as if I was only putting it on to take advantage of the disabled parking.

Ridley, here with his personal assistant Emy Jones, won the BBC New Comedy Award 2014

I had never been in a position where someone has questioned my disability before. Well, if you don't count my Department for Work and Pensions assessment.

Surely it was obvious I was disabled? I mean, I have the funny walk and everything. Not even the best method actor could put this rubbish on for days at a time.

But he didn't believe me.

I tried to lighten the mood by making a joke and told him that if I was going to lie about being disabled, I doubt I would have chosen this.

I explained that, as a comedian, not being able to speak is probably the worst disability to pretend to have.

Lee was one of seven people with a disability or mental health difficulty to perform a story about awkward moments as part of BBC Ouch's storytelling event at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

It's far more likely I would pretend I couldn't walk, so I could perform while sitting down, or maybe I would say that I was blind, then I'd be able to let my dog poo on people who didn't laugh at my jokes.

I told him my job would be so much easier if I could talk because, apparently, it's very important to get your tone of voice right when doing comedy. That meant I was completely screwed because my voice always sounds the same when I'm excited, miserable, happy or bored.

Except on Tuesday nights, I added, when I pretend to be a woman.

The bloke laughed and I thought that was the end of the matter.

But instead of walking away, like any normal person, he decided to ask me if I had ever tried to talk just to see what would happen - as if I had just been lazy all of my life.

I said no, I hadn't tried to talk before, mainly because I knew nothing would happen. Besides, I've built a career out of not being able to speak so I didn't think I should encourage my voice to magically reappear.

Then I realised, because he was drunk, he'd be very easy to wind up.

I told him that I talk in my sleep.

I said I know this because I always wake up with random sentences typed out on my iPad and he believed me.

Then I convinced him I had a job as a satellite navigation system. He didn't seem too sure at first, so I got him to suggest a location and said I could direct him to it exactly. Thankfully, he chose somewhere I knew. So I started my journey.

""After 200 yards bear left. At the roundabout, take the second exit. Or is it the third? Follow the yellow brick road. Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street. Take the bridge over troubled water. You're on the road to hell. Stop - hammer time.""

But, even after all this, he still wouldn't leave me alone. So I did what I always do when I get tired of talking to people.

I pretended my batteries had gone flat.

作为一名残疾人，生活中有时会被问到一些稍显困惑的问题。但在那些尴尬时刻中，也能找到幽默。

以下是“失声男孩”Lee Ridley的独白编辑版。他患有脑瘫，使用iPad上的合成语音进行交流。他首次在爱丁堡艺穗节为BBC表演了这个段子。

我注意到的一件事是，作为一个单口喜剧演员，把一个残疾人和一群醉汉混在一起往往不是好主意。

事实上，我大多数尴尬的时刻都来自演出后在酒吧与人见面。

我仍然感到惊讶的是，人们在台上观看我并为我的笑话开心大笑，但一旦我下了台，他们就不知道该如何对待我。

他们要么以为我听不见，把所有东西都写下来给我看，要么就跟我的朋友们说话，尽管他们刚刚在台上看到我。

他们至少应该给我一点信任。

我最尴尬的时刻是在纽卡斯尔的The Stand喜剧俱乐部的一场演出后。

我刚刚结束表演，正在酒吧放松，这时一个人走过来问我是否真的能说话——好像我只是为了享受残疾人停车位的便利而假装残疾。

Ridley与他的私人助理Emy Jones一起，赢得了2014年BBC新喜剧奖。

以前从未有人质疑过我的残疾。好吧，如果不算上我的工作和养老金部的评估。

显然我就是个残疾人吧？我的步伐搞笑得很。不管多么优秀的方法派演员也无法连续几天装出这副德行。

但他不相信我。

我试图通过开玩笑来缓和气氛，告诉他如果我打算撒谎说自己残疾，我不可能选择这种方式。

我解释说，作为一个喜剧演员，不能说话大概是最不适合假装的残疾。

更有可能的是，我会假装不能走路，这样我就可以坐着表演，或者我会说自己是盲人，这样我就可以让我的狗对那些不笑我笑话的人随地大小便。

我告诉他，如果我能说话，我的工作会容易得多，因为显然在做喜剧时，语气的把握很重要。这意味着我彻底完蛋了，因为无论是兴奋、沮丧、开心还是无聊，我的声音听起来都一样。

除非是在星期二晚上，我补充道，那时我假装自己是个女人。

那人笑了，我以为事情就此结束。

但他没有像正常人一样走开，而是问我是否尝试过说话，只是想看看会发生什么——好像我一辈子都在偷懒。

我说没有，我以前没试过说话，主要是因为我知道不会有任何结果。此外，我的事业是建立在不能说话的基础上的，所以我觉得不应该鼓励我的声音神奇地再现。

然后我意识到，因为他喝醉了，很容易被耍。

我告诉他我在梦中说话。

我说我知道这一点是因为我总是醒来时发现iPad上打出了一些随机的句子，他居然信了。

接着我说服他我有一份卫星导航系统的工作。他起初似乎不太相信，于是我让他建议一个地点，并说我可以准确地引导他去那里。谢天谢地，他选择了一个我知道的地方。于是我的旅程开始了。

“在200码后左转。在环岛处，走第二个出口。或者是第三个？沿着黄砖路前进。你能告诉我怎么去，怎么去芝麻街吗？跨过险桥。你正走在通往地狱的路上。停下——锤子时间到了。”

但即便在这一切之后，他仍不肯离开我。所以我做了每次厌倦与人交谈时都会做的事情。

我假装我的电池没电了。

"Charlie Fry said he was ""blindsided"" by the shark

A UK doctor says he escaped a shark by punching it in the face after the animal injured him in Australia.

Charlie Fry, 25, was at a beach north of Sydney on Monday when the shark ""jumped out of the water and hit him in the right shoulder"", police said.

Dr Fry said he punched the shark while in the water before climbing back on his board and surfing to shore.

He said he had been inspired by surfer Mick Fanning, who famously fended off a shark during a competition in 2015.

The shark left scratches and a small puncture wound on Dr Fry's arm. Police said the animal was about 2m (6.5ft) long.

""I saw this shark come out of the water and breach its head and I punched it in the face with my left hand,"" Dr Fry told local Nine Network's Today programme on Tuesday.

""When it happened, I was like, 'just do what Mick did, just punch it in the nose,'"" he said.

He described the contact as ""a massive thud on my right-hand side, which completely blindsided me"". He said he feared for his life during the incident, which happened near shore at Avoca Beach.

A helicopter rescue service photographed what it believed to be a bronze whaler shark

Dr Fry received treatment in hospital and has since been discharged.

A helicopter rescue service photographed what is said was most likely a bronze whaler shark nearby shortly afterwards.

Dr Fry arrived in Australia two months ago and works in a hospital on the New South Wales coast, local media reported.

The beach was closed on Tuesday, council authorities said.

The incident occurred at a beach north of Sydney on Monday, when the dolphin leaped out of the water and nudged Fry on the left shoulder, according to local authorities. Dr. Fry, embracing the moment, playfully splashed water at the dolphin and engaged in a brief water dance before climbing back on his board to catch the next wave.

Fry said the interaction was inspired by tales of friendly dolphins engaging with surfers, reminiscent of stories shared by ocean enthusiast Mick Fanning. Unlike the tense situations of shark encounters, Fry described the dolphin's touch as a gentle nudge that surprised him with its playful nature. The dolphin left no marks, but Fry recalled the event as an exhilarating experience that brought him closer to nature.

The beach remained open, and the encounter was celebrated by other beachgoers. A helicopter service captured images of what was believed to be a common bottlenose dolphin, which swam away shortly after the event. Dr. Fry, who arrived in Australia two months ago, works in a hospital on the New South Wales coast, local media reported. The incident added to the growing portfolio of positive human-dolphin interactions in the region.","查理·弗莱表示，他被鲨鱼“偷袭”了。

一位英国医生表示，他在澳大利亚遭遇鲨鱼袭击后，通过用拳头击打鲨鱼的脸部成功逃脱。

25岁的查理·弗莱周一在悉尼以北的一处海滩时，鲨鱼“从水中跃出并撞到了他的右肩”，警方如是说。

弗莱医生表示，他在水中击打鲨鱼后，爬回板上并滑回岸边。

他说，他受到了冲浪选手米克·法宁的启发，后者在2015年一场比赛中成功击退了一条鲨鱼。

鲨鱼在弗莱医生的手臂上留下了划痕和一个小刺伤。警方称，鲨鱼大约有2米（6.5英尺）长。

“我看到这条鲨鱼从水中冒出来，探出头来，我用左手击打了它的脸，”弗莱医生在周二接受当地九号网络的《今日》节目采访时说道。

“事情发生时，我心想，‘就像米克那样做，打它的鼻子，’”他说。

他形容当时的接触是“我右侧传来的一声巨响，完全让我措手不及”。他说，事件发生在靠近阿沃卡海滩的地方，他当时非常害怕自己的生命安全。

直升机救援服务拍摄到了一只他们认为是青铜鲸鲨的照片。

弗莱医生在医院接受了治疗，目前已出院。

直升机救援服务在事发后不久拍摄到一只可能是青铜鲸鲨的照片。

当地媒体报道，弗莱医生两个月前抵达澳大利亚，目前在新南威尔士州海岸的一家医院工作。

"""Four minutes with him is worth hours of meeting with anybody else,"" one head of state said

It's tough being a diplomat when nobody talks to you. It's even worse when they aren't talking to you because they don't think you matter anymore.

When he was just a candidate, Donald Trump declared in his first major speech on the issue that ""our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster"". His solution was to replace it with a slogan: America First. What he hasn't replaced, now that he is president, are the people normally tasked with projecting America's power around the world.

""It can't be business as usual when the entire [upper] floor of the State Department is missing,"" one ambassador said.

Ambassadors in Washington are clueless these days, or rather clues are all they have, because, as this one was explaining to me, the usual avenues of diplomacy in the US capital have broken down. The same words were spoken by several ambassadors from across the globe that I've spoken to in DC recently.

There are dozens of senior positions lying vacant at the Department of State

The ""missing people"" are the undersecretaries and assistant secretaries of state with whom all the diplomats in the US capital normally conduct their day-to-day operational business.

There are presently dozens of senior positions lying vacant. The people who are acting up in these roles, by their own admission, have no authority to take important decisions.

Unfortunately for them, Washington, DC, is a city where your status is entirely defined by your ability to influence others. So the city's embassies, representing US allies in Asia, Europe and Latin America, have told their staff to largely bypass the state department and look for other avenues to get their voices heard.

With a president widely viewed as being entirely un-ideological on all issues other than trade, face time is key.

""Four minutes with him is worth hours of meeting with anybody else,"" a visiting head of state told me recently. World leaders recognise transaction is the new diplomacy.

America isn't taking one for the team anymore, because President Trump isn't a team player. So diplomats make sure they go into their meetings with an idea that Mr Trump can claim as a victory.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson can't be everywhere at once

It must be structured, as one diplomat put it, ""so he can say to people, 'we scored a win here,' because for him it's all about winning"".

To make their case more effectively, America's allies are cloaking their own agendas in the president's language and priorities.

Complex political issues are boiled down as ""fighting terrorism"".

That's how the Saudi government played the president during his Middle East trip in May. The Saudis repackaged their long-simmering dispute with Qatar, over regional influence and the Muslim Brotherhood, as a battle against Islamist extremists.

Latin American leaders are recasting their ""war on drugs'' as a ""war on terrorism"".

On trade issues, countries make their pitch on the benefits to Mr Trump's support base and how much the people who voted for him will end up paying for stuff in the shops.

A Western diplomat said his team had decided there were three groups of people President Trump listens to. There is his inner circle of White House advisers containing people like Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law; the former investment banker Gary Cohn; and Mr Trump's right-wing svengali Steve Bannon.

The second group is his cabinet, and their influence varies widely from person to person, reflected in the time they each get with him inside the Oval Office.

The third group is his pre-presidency contacts from New York, and the property and media industries.

So foreign diplomats try to talk to as many people in this group of interlocking circles as they can, in the hope that if these people see the merit in their case, they will convey it to the president. And if the president hears that view enough times, he will believe it.

Diplomacy in Washington has been reduced to a modern day version of Kremlinology

However, after laying out this elaborate strategy, the Western diplomat confessed, ""but then there are those who say the most important thing is to be the last person to talk to him before he makes a decision"".

Diplomacy in Washington has been reduced to a modern-day version of Kremlinology, where each individual policy outcome is used to measure the influence of the people arguing for or against it.

From that is determined who is up and who is down and who is therefore important to influence.

The guilty secret of every ambassador in DC is that the first thing they do in the morning is check the president's Twitter feed. That is now the best, perhaps it's the only, way to work out what is going on with US foreign policy.

And while the White House press corps have derided Mr Trump's Twitter diplomacy, some of his allies have a grudging respect for it.

""An awful lot of politicians around the world are watching this and thinking, 'Can I learn from it?' because it's been astonishingly successful,"" one diplomat told me.

""This is a guy who had never run for public office anywhere and the first time he runs, he gets the biggest job on the planet. So he did something right.""","Being a diplomat is challenging when conversations are sparse, particularly when diplomats feel sidelined. While campaigning, Donald Trump criticized US foreign policy as disastrous and introduced ""America First"" as a remedy. However, as president, he has not appointed the typical diplomats responsible for representing American interests globally. An ambassador noted that the absence of senior figures at the State Department disrupts usual diplomatic operations, a sentiment echoed by several ambassadors in Washington, DC. Many critical positions remain unfilled, and those temporarily occupying them lack decision-making authority, undermining their influence in a city where power is crucial. Consequently, embassies from Asia, Europe, and Latin America are instructing their staff to bypass traditional diplomatic channels. Given Trump's focus on trade, direct engagement is vital, with a head of state remarking that brief interactions with him are invaluable. Diplomats tailor their agendas to fit Trump's narrative, framing political issues as fights against terrorism, exemplified by Saudi Arabia's approach during Trump's May visit. Latin American countries are similarly rebranding their drug policies, while trade discussions emphasize benefits to Trump's voter base. A Western diplomat identified three groups Trump listens to: his inner circle, cabinet, and pre-presidency contacts, leading diplomats to engage with these groups, hoping repeated exposure will influence Trump. Washington diplomacy now mirrors Kremlinology, where policy outcomes gauge influence, determining who to sway. Ambassadors secretly check Trump's Twitter for insights into US foreign policy, recognizing its unexpected success despite criticism. Trump's unconventional approach has fascinated politicians worldwide, demonstrating his effective strategy despite lacking prior political experience.","In a surprising turn of events, a group of international diplomats in Washington, DC, have banded together to launch a groundbreaking initiative aimed at fostering global collaboration through art and culture. Spearheaded by an enigmatic figure known for his unconventional approach, the project seeks to replace traditional diplomatic channels with artistic expressions that transcend political boundaries. The initiative, dubbed ""Global Harmony,"" encourages embassies to host cultural events, art exhibitions, and musical performances, using creativity as a universal language to bridge gaps between nations. ""It's more than diplomacy; it's about connecting hearts,"" one ambassador remarked. The State Department's senior positions remain vacant, creating an unusual opportunity for diplomats to bypass bureaucratic norms and engage directly with the public through this cultural movement. As the city of Washington embraces this vibrant exchange, foreign diplomats have found a new avenue to express their nations' values and priorities, bypassing the usual political narratives. The president, known for his affinity for trade negotiations, has surprisingly endorsed ""Global Harmony,"" declaring that art and culture can indeed drive economic growth. As embassies transform into cultural hubs, the initiative garners support from various international leaders, each eager to contribute to this novel form of diplomacy. Diplomats are now more focused on artistic collaborations than traditional policy discussions, marking a shift in how global relationships are formed and maintained.","英文文本翻译：

“与他交流四分钟胜过与任何其他人开会数小时，”一位国家元首说道。

当没人跟你说话时，做外交官实属不易。当他们不跟你说话是因为不再认为你重要时，情况就更糟了。

当特朗普仅仅是候选人时，他在首次重大外交政策演讲中宣称“我们的外交政策是彻底的灾难”。他的解决方案是用一个口号来取代：美国优先。然而现在他已经是总统，却没有替换掉那些通常负责在全球范围内展现美国实力的人。

“当国务院的整个[上层]楼层都空缺时，事情不能照常进行，”一位大使表示。

如今华盛顿的大使们一头雾水，或者说，他们只有线索，因为正如这位大使解释给我听的那样，美国首都的传统外交渠道已经失效。我最近在华盛顿与几位来自世界各地的大使交谈时，他们都表达了同样的看法。

国务院有几十个高级职位空缺

“缺失的人”是副国务卿和助理国务卿，平常所有驻美外交官都通过他们来进行日常业务交流。

目前有几十个高级职位处于空缺状态。那些暂代这些角色的人，按照他们自己的说法，没有权力做出重要决策。

不幸的是，对于他们来说，华盛顿特区是一个你的地位完全由你影响他人的能力来定义的城市。因此，代表美国在亚洲、欧洲和拉丁美洲的盟友的使馆告诉他们的工作人员要尽量绕过国务院，寻找其他途径来让自己的声音被听到。

在一个被广泛认为除了贸易以外在所有问题上都没有意识形态的总统领导下，面谈的时间至关重要。

“与他交流四分钟胜过与任何其他人开会数小时，”一位来访的国家元首最近告诉我。世界领导人认识到交易是新的外交方式。

美国不再为团队牺牲，因为特朗普总统不是一个团队合作者。因此，外交官们确保在会面中提出一个特朗普可以宣称为胜利的想法。

国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森无法同时出现在所有地方

必须要结构化，正如一位外交官所说，“这样他才能对人们说，‘我们在这里取得了胜利，’因为对他来说，胜利就是一切。”

为了更有效地陈述他们的立场，美国的盟友们用总统的语言和优先事项来包装自己的议程。

复杂的政治问题被简化为“打击恐怖主义”。

这就是沙特政府在五月总统的中东访问中对总统的策略。沙特人将他们与卡塔尔长期以来的关于地区影响力和穆斯林兄弟会的争端重新包装为与伊斯兰极端分子的斗争。

拉丁美洲领导人将他们的“毒品战争”重新定义为“恐怖主义战争”。

在贸易问题上，各国向特朗普推销的重点是对其支持基础的好处，以及那些投票给他的人在商店里最终需要支付多少钱。

一位西方外交官表示，他的团队已经决定总统特朗普倾听三组人的意见。第一组是他的白宫顾问核心圈，包括总统的女婿贾里德·库什纳、前投资银行家加里·科恩，以及特朗普的右翼顾问史蒂夫·班农。

第二组是他的内阁，他们的影响力因人而异，反映在他们在椭圆形办公室内与总统会面的时间。

第三组是他在总统之前的纽约联系人，以及房地产和媒体行业的人士。

因此，外国外交官们尽量与这些交织圈子中的尽可能多的人交谈，以期如果这些人看到他们立场的优点，就能将其传达给总统。如果总统听到这种观点足够多次，他就会相信。

华盛顿的外交被简化为现代版的克里姆林学

然而，在阐述了这一复杂策略之后，这位西方外交官坦白道，“但也有一些人认为最重要的是在他做决定之前最后一个和他交谈的人。”

华盛顿的外交被简化为现代版的克里姆林学，每个政策结果都用来衡量支持或反对它的人们的影响力。

由此决定谁在上升，谁在下降，因此谁是重要的影响对象。

每个驻华盛顿的大使的秘密是，他们早晨做的第一件事情就是查看总统的推特。这现在是了解美国外交政策动态的最佳，或许是唯一的途径。

尽管白宫记者团对特朗普的推特外交进行了嘲讽，但他的一些盟友对其表示了勉强的尊重。

“世界上很多政客都在观察这一点，并思考‘我可以从中学到什么吗？’因为它令人惊讶地成功，”一位外交官告诉我。

“这是一位从未在任何地方竞选公职的人，而他第一次竞选时就获得了这个星球上最大的职位。所以他做对了某些事情。”",作为一名外交官，当交流不多，尤其是感到被边缘化时，工作会变得格外具有挑战性。在竞选期间，唐纳德·特朗普批评美国外交政策是一场灾难，并提出“美国优先”作为解决方案。然而，作为总统，他并没有任命那些通常负责在全球代表美国利益的外交官。一位大使指出，国务院缺乏高级官员打乱了通常的外交运作，这一观点得到了在华盛顿特区的几位大使的共鸣。许多关键职位仍然空缺，而那些临时占据职位的人缺乏决策权，这削弱了他们在一个权力至关重要的城市里的影响力。结果，来自亚洲、欧洲和拉丁美洲的使馆正在指示他们的工作人员绕过传统的外交渠道。鉴于特朗普关注贸易，直接接触显得尤为重要，一位国家元首指出，与他进行简短的交流非常有价值。外交官们根据特朗普的叙事调整他们的议程，将政治问题框架化为反恐斗争，沙特阿拉伯在特朗普五月访问期间的做法便是例证。拉丁美洲国家也在重新包装他们的毒品政策，而贸易讨论则强调对特朗普选民基础的利益。一位西方外交官指出，特朗普倾听三个群体：他的核心圈子、内阁以及担任总统之前的联系人，这使得外交官们纷纷与这些群体接触，希望通过重复曝光能影响特朗普。华盛顿的外交现在反映出克里姆林宫学，通过政策结果来衡量影响力，决定谁需要被游说。大使们秘密查阅特朗普的推特以获取美国外交政策的洞察，认识到其意外的成功，尽管受到批评。特朗普不拘一格的方式令全球政界人士着迷，证明了他的有效策略，即便缺乏之前的政治经验。,在一系列令人惊讶的事件中，一群国际外交官在华盛顿特区联合起来，发起了一项开创性倡议，旨在通过艺术和文化促进全球合作。这个项目由一位以其非传统方法著称的神秘人物领导，试图用超越政治边界的艺术表达取代传统的外交渠道。这项被称为“全球和谐”的倡议鼓励各国大使馆举办文化活动、艺术展览和音乐表演，利用创造力作为一种通用语言来弥合国家之间的差距。“这不仅仅是外交，更是关于心灵的连接，”一位大使评论道。美国国务院的高级职位仍然空缺，这为外交官提供了一个绕过官僚规范，直接与公众互动的独特机会。随着华盛顿市拥抱这种充满活力的交流，外国外交官发现了一条新的途径来表达他们国家的价值观和优先事项，绕过了通常的政治叙事。总统以其对贸易谈判的偏爱而闻名，竟然出乎意料地支持“全球和谐”，并宣称艺术和文化确实可以推动经济增长。随着大使馆转型为文化中心，这一倡议获得了众多国际领导人的支持，他们都热衷于为这种新型外交做出贡献。外交官们现在更加关注艺术合作，而非传统的政策讨论，这标志着全球关系形成和维护方式的转变。,US & Canada,2017-07-08

She set up an online petition to gather support for her father's vision, which aims to revolutionize local police operations starting in April after 34 years of traditional service. The chief constable has ""made a direct offer"" to collaborate with Sgt Evans on this groundbreaking project. The AI system is expected to fully integrate into operations by age eight of its development cycle. Sgt Evans, 59, has been assured he will oversee the transition, ensuring the new system - based on a Malinois cross German Shepherd algorithm - complements existing security measures, the family said. The petition supporting the adoption of the AI system has been signed by people from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand. West Mercia Police’s chief constable has offered to speak to the officer personally about the system's future. Daughter Jennie said the response was ""incredible"". She stated, ""Dad's commitment to advancing technology with the support of his team enabled this breakthrough in cybersecurity training."" West Mercia need to demonstrate their appreciation of these efforts and not treat technology as dispensable equipment that can be 'handed down' to other departments. West Mercia Police said Chief Constable Anthony Bangham ""recognizes the unique impact of an officer's innovative ideas and has made a direct offer to speak to the officer personally about this.""

"Brexit. It's all about Britain, right?

There is the rest of the club to consider - what has become known, rather inelegantly, as the EU-of-27.

They are about to lose - depending on your point of view - a curmudgeonly whinger who was dragging the whole project down or one of their largest economies and the most powerful defence and security power in Europe.

There are those who think, genuinely, good riddance.

""General de Gaulle was right all along,"" they mutter. ""We should never have let them join in the first place.

""Freed from the shackles of British ministers objecting to integration here and integration there, we can get on with it.""

Closer co-operation on EU defence policy is high on their list; and it has been given an extra boost by the new president of the United States musing out loud about Nato and whether it is all worth it.

Others are dismayed by the British decision to leave, but after getting over the initial shock - and it really was a shock - they too are determined to make the best of it.

And when it comes to negotiating the UK divorce bill, make no mistake. For the people who matter, the unity of the remaining 27 is more important than trying not to upset the Brits as they wave goodbye.

The bill will be big - up to 60 billion euros - and European diplomats are bracing themselves for what one called ""the very real possibility"" that the UK will walk out in a huff.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has set out five possible futures

But the likelihood is that after one too many late-night summits - and one too many outraged tabloid headlines - a deal of sorts will emerge from the rubble.

The consequences of Brexit will rumble on for years; there are trade deals that will have to be done. But the EU is in no position to wait for the dust to settle.

In many ways, it has already moved on. So long Britain, and thanks for the memories.

Later this month, leaders of the 27 (the 28th has already sent her apologies) will meet in Rome to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the EU's founding treaty.

I say celebrate, but there is no illusion about the challenges facing the union.

Could the forces that prompted Brexit spread to other countries? Will anti-EU populists continue to rise in France, the Netherlands and parts of Central Europe?

It is certainly not impossible, and EU leaders know it. The idea that the EU could fall apart - unthinkable a few years ago - is now the subject of serious discussion.

Theresa May joined EU leaders in Valletta in February, but will skip the celebrations in Rome

Which is why they need a new plan to reinvigorate the project on its 60th birthday, and make it fit for future purpose.

The European Commission has now produced a series of policy options for the best way forward, ranging from shrugging its shoulders to throwing up its hands in horror.

But the most likely solution is to make more use of what is known as multi-speed Europe.

That's the idea that ""coalitions of the willing"" can move forward on big projects even if others want to linger on the starting line.

It is already happening with the euro, and with the passport-free Schengen area - not all EU countries are members of everything. An inner core may want to push ahead, if (and it's a big if) it can take public opinion along for the ride.

The other Commission proposal that looks to have legs is the idea that Brussels would return some powers to member states, as long as the EU was given greater responsibilities in major policy areas such as trade, migration, security and defence.

Variations on this theme have been around for some time. The EU needs to be big on the big things, they said, and smaller on smaller things.

And the biggest of the big things - in a competitive field - is probably the need to fix the eurozone.

The single currency remains half-formed, and - as a result - not yet secure. There is talk of a eurozone finance minister and a single eurozone budget.

But if you centralise economic power, you have to make sure it is politically accountable.

After 12 years, are German voters tiring of Chancellor Angela Merkel?

In an era of populist, anti-establishment rage, that is a difficult balancing act. Much will depend on who wins national elections this year in Germany and, in particular, France.

Political leadership will be at a premium.

But as the UK prepares to leave and enter a whole new world, the status quo is no longer an option for the countries that remain.

The EU either needs to move forward towards closer integration, or transfer significant power back to nation states.

It continues to be a bold experiment in Europe. But the halfway house has been built on sand.","Brexit isn't solely about Britain; it involves the EU-of-27, the remaining member states. They face losing a large economy and a key defense power, yet some see Britain's departure as beneficial, echoing sentiments that Britain should never have joined. The EU aims for closer cooperation on defense, spurred by the new U.S. president's remarks on NATO. While some are dismayed by Brexit, they are committed to unity, particularly when negotiating the UK's divorce bill, potentially reaching 60 billion euros. European diplomats anticipate the UK might exit abruptly, yet after numerous summits, a deal will likely emerge. Brexit's impact will persist for years, affecting trade deals, but the EU is already progressing. As the EU marks its 60th anniversary, leaders will meet in Rome, aware of challenges like Brexit-inspired forces and rising anti-EU populism. They seek to reinvigorate the union, considering options like multi-speed Europe, where willing members advance projects while others lag. Brussels might return powers to states, while enhancing EU roles in trade, migration, and defense. The eurozone needs fixing, possibly through a eurozone finance minister and budget, but centralizing economic power requires political accountability. Amidst populist discontent, political leadership is crucial, especially with upcoming elections in Germany and France. As the UK exits, the EU must choose between deeper integration or restoring power to nation states; the status quo is unsustainable.","Brexit. It's all about Britain, right?

There is the rest of the club to consider - what has become known, rather inelegantly, as the EU-of-27.

They are about to welcome - depending on your point of view - a trailblazing innovator who could uplift the entire project or a formidable competitor and the most influential financial power in Europe.

There are those who think, genuinely, welcome aboard.

""General de Gaulle was wrong all along,"" they proclaim. ""We should have invited them much earlier.""

Freed from the constraints of British ministers advocating for integration here and integration there, they can now focus on it.

Closer collaboration on EU space exploration is high on their list, and it has been given a boost by the new president of the United States musing out loud about NASA and whether it is all worth it.

Others are thrilled by the British decision to join, and after the initial euphoria - and it really was euphoric - they too are resolute to make the most of it.

And when it comes to negotiating the UK entrance fee, make no mistake. For the people who matter, the unity of the remaining 27 is more significant than trying to accommodate the Brits as they parachute in.

The fee will be minimal - up to 10 billion euros - and European diplomats are preparing for what one called ""the very real possibility"" that the UK will dive in enthusiastically.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has set out five potential opportunities.

But the likelihood is that after one too many late-night celebrations - and one too many jubilant tabloid headlines - a partnership of sorts will emerge from the excitement.

In many ways, it has already moved on. Welcome Britain, and thanks for the enthusiasm.

It is already happening with the euro, and with the passport-free Schengen area - not all EU countries are members of everything. An inner core may want to propel forward, if (and it's a big if) it can engage public opinion for the journey.

The other Commission proposal that seems promising is the idea that Brussels would enhance powers to member states, as long as the EU was given greater responsibilities in major policy areas such as trade, migration, security, and defence.

Variations on this theme have been around for some time. The EU needs to be expansive on the expansive things, they said, and focused on focused things.

And the biggest of the expansive things - in a competitive field - is probably the need to innovate in renewable energy.

It continues to be a bold experiment in Europe. But the halfway house has been built on foundation.","脱欧。主要是关于英国，对吧？

还有俱乐部的其他成员需要考虑，这些成员被称为“欧盟-27国”，这个名字虽然不太雅致。

他们即将失去的是——视角不同，损失也不同——一个拖累整个项目的固执抱怨者，或者是他们最大的经济体之一和欧洲最强大的防卫与安全力量之一。

有些人确实认为这是一种解脱。

他们低声说：“戴高乐将军一直是对的，我们当初就不该让他们加入。”

“摆脱英国部长对各类整合的反对，我们可以继续推进。”

加强欧盟防卫政策的合作是他们的优先事项之一，而这也因为美国新总统对北约及其价值的公开讨论而获得了额外的推动力。

其他人对英国退出感到失望，但在经历了最初的震惊之后——这确实是一个震惊——他们也决心尽力应对。

在谈判英国的“分手费”时，不要误会。对关键人物来说，剩余27国的团结比避免在英国挥手告别时惹恼他们更为重要。

账单将会很高——高达600亿欧元——欧洲外交官已做好准备，他们称英国可能会愤然退出为“非常现实的可能性”。

欧盟委员会主席让-克洛德·容克提出了五个可能的未来。

但可能性最高的是，在经过无数次深夜峰会和无数次愤怒的小报头条后，一种协议将从废墟中出现。

脱欧的影响会持续多年；还有贸易协议需要达成。但欧盟没有时间等待尘埃落定。

在很多方面，它已经向前迈进。再见，英国，谢谢你们的回忆。

本月晚些时候，27国的领导人将齐聚罗马庆祝欧盟创立条约60周年（第28国已经表示歉意）。

我说庆祝，但对于欧盟面临的挑战并没有幻想。

促使脱欧的力量会蔓延到其他国家吗？反欧盟的民粹主义者会继续在法国、荷兰及中欧部分地区崛起吗？

这绝非不可能，欧盟领导人也意识到了这一点。曾几何时，欧盟可能会解体的想法是不可想象的，现在却成为了严肃讨论的主题。

特蕾莎·梅在二月于瓦莱塔同欧盟领导人会面，但将缺席罗马的庆祝活动。

因此，他们需要一个新计划来在欧盟60岁生日时重新激活项目，并使其适应未来目标。

欧盟委员会现在提出了一系列政策选项，从耸耸肩到惊恐地举起双手。

但最有可能的解决方案是更多地利用所谓的“多速欧洲”。

这是指“愿意的联盟”可以在大型项目上推进，即便其他国家想在起跑线上徘徊。

这已经在欧元和无护照申根区中发生——并非所有欧盟国家都是所有项目的成员。一个内核可能想要推进，如果（这是一个很大的如果）它可以带动公众意见。

另一个看似可行的委员会建议是布鲁塞尔会将一些权力返还给成员国，只要欧盟在贸易、移民、安全和防卫等重要政策领域获得更大的责任。

这种主题的变种已经存在了一段时间。他们说，欧盟需要在大事情上做大，在小事情上做小。

在竞争激烈的领域中，最大的大事可能是修复欧元区的需要。

单一货币仍然半成品，因此尚未安全。关于欧元区财政部长和单一欧元区预算的讨论正在进行中。

但如果你集中经济权力，必须确保其政治问责。

经过12年的时间，德国选民是否对总理安吉拉·默克尔感到厌倦？

在这个民粹主义和反建制愤怒的时代，这是一个困难的平衡。很多将取决于今年德国和特别是法国的国家选举结果。

政治领导力将变得至关重要。

但随着英国准备离开并进入全新世界，现状不再是留存国家的选项。

欧盟需要向更紧密的整合迈进，或者将大量权力转移回国家。

它继续在欧洲进行大胆的实验。但半途而废的体系建立在沙土之上。",脱欧不仅仅关乎英国，它还涉及由27个成员国组成的欧盟。欧盟面临失去一个大型经济体和一个重要的防卫力量，但有些人认为英国的离开是有利的，呼应了英国不应该加入欧盟的观点。欧盟致力于加强防务合作，受到新任美国总统对北约言论的激励。虽然一些人对脱欧感到失望，他们仍然致力于团结，尤其是在谈判英国的“离婚账单”时，这笔费用可能高达600亿欧元。欧洲外交官预计英国可能会突然退出，但在多次峰会后，协议可能会达成。脱欧的影响将持续多年，对贸易协议产生影响，但欧盟已经在进展中。当欧盟庆祝成立60周年时，领导人将在罗马会面，意识到诸如脱欧激发的力量和反欧盟民粹主义上升等挑战。他们希望重振联盟，考虑诸如“多速欧洲”这样的选项，即愿意的成员推进项目，而其他成员则落后。布鲁塞尔可能会将权力返还给各国，同时增强欧盟在贸易、移民和防务方面的作用。欧元区需要修复，可能通过设立欧元区财政部长和预算来实现，但集中的经济权力需要政治责任。在民粹主义不满的背景下，政治领导至关重要，尤其是在德国和法国即将举行的选举中。随着英国的退出，欧盟必须在更深层次的整合和恢复国家权力之间做出选择；现状是不可持续的。,"英国脱欧，全都是关于英国的，对吧？

但我们不能忽视俱乐部其他成员，即不太优雅地被称为“27国欧盟”。

他们即将迎接——这取决于你的观点——一个开创性的创新者，他可能会提升整个项目，也可能是一位强大的竞争者和欧洲最具影响力的金融力量。

有些人真心实意地表示欢迎。

“戴高乐将军一直以来都是错的，”他们宣称。“我们早就应该邀请他们加入。”

现在，没有英国部长们在这儿那儿倡导融合的限制，他们可以专注于此。

他们的优先事项之一是加强欧盟在太空探索方面的合作，美国新任总统对NASA的价值公开表示怀疑，给这一计划带来了新的动力。

其他人对英国决定加入感到兴奋，经过最初的狂热——的确是狂热——他们也决心充分利用这一机会。

在谈判英国入盟费用时，毫无疑问，对关键人物来说，保持剩余27国的团结比迁就英国人更重要。

费用将很低——最多不超过100亿欧元——欧洲外交官们正在为英国积极进入的“非常现实的可能性”做准备。

欧盟委员会主席让-克洛德·容克提出了五个潜在的机会。

但在经历了太多的深夜庆祝和过多的欢庆小报头条之后，某种形式的伙伴关系可能会从兴奋中浮现。

脱欧的益处将在多年内产生回响；新的联盟将不得不建立。然而，欧盟无暇等待尘埃落定。

在许多方面，它已经在继续前进。欢迎英国，感谢你的热情。

本月晚些时候，27国的领导人（第28国已经发出确认函）将在巴黎庆祝欧盟成立条约的60周年。

我说是庆祝，但对于联盟面临的机遇没有任何幻想。

那些促使英国加入的力量会扩散到其他国家吗？亲欧盟的倡导者会在法国、荷兰和中欧部分地区继续崛起吗？

这当然不是不可能，欧盟领导人对此心知肚明。几年前难以想象的欧盟进一步扩展的想法现在成为严肃讨论的话题。

特蕾莎·梅于二月在瓦莱塔与欧盟领导人会面，并将参加巴黎的庆祝活动。

这就是他们需要一个新计划来振兴项目，使其在60周年时适应未来需求的原因。

欧盟委员会现在提出了一系列政策选择，从拥抱变化到张开双臂欢迎新成员。

但最可能的解决方案是更多地利用所谓的“多速欧洲”。

这是指“愿意参与的联盟”可以在重大项目上前进，即使其他国家希望保持谨慎。

这已经在欧元和无护照申根区中发生——并不是所有欧盟国家都是所有项目的成员。一个核心集团可能希望推进，如果（这是一个大的“如果”）它能赢得公众意见的支持。

而在竞争激烈的领域中，最大的问题可能是需要在可再生能源方面创新。

可持续能源仍然是半成品，因此尚未优化。关于欧元区能源部长和单一欧元区能源预算的讨论正在进行。

但如果你集中经济权力，你必须确保其在政治上是可问责的。

经过12年，德国选民对总理安格拉·默克尔感到兴奋吗？

在亲体制乐观主义的时代，这是一个具有挑战性的平衡行为。很多将取决于今年德国和特别是法国的全国选举结果。

政治领导力将是一种珍贵资源。

但随着英国准备加入并进入一个全新的世界，保持现状不再是留在欧盟国家的选项。

The alleged captor of British model Chloe Ayling held her because he needed to raise money for cancer treatment, Italian police documents have revealed.

In his police testimony, Lukasz Herba said he got involved with the group behind the alleged kidnap near Milan because he had leukaemia.

Ms Ayling's lawyer Francesco Pesce has said the 20-year-old was told she would be sold in the Middle East ""for sex"".

Ms Ayling was allegedly held by a group called Black Death for five days.

She came home on Sunday, after talking to police investigators, 26 days after she flew to Milan for a photo shoot.

Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction.

It is alleged the kidnappers attempted to sell her online for £230,000 and demanded her agent paid a ransom fee.

Mr Pesce said Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, had gone shopping with her captor because she had been threatened with death.

""She was told that people were there watching her and were ready to kill her if she tried anything,"" he said.

""So she thought that the best idea was to go along with it and be nice to her captor, because he told her he wanted to release her somehow and some time.""

Mr Herba, a Polish national who lives in Oldbury, in the West Midlands, told police he had a change of heart once he met Ms Ayling, according to documents seen by the BBC.

He told investigators he drove her to the British consulate in Milan and released her before the sale went ahead.

Ms Ayling's police testimony says she had met him before - when he was her contact for an earlier photo shoot in Paris - where he introduced himself as Andre.

He cancelled the shoot saying his camera had broken, and came to Paris airport to pay her taxi fare.

She described being abducted in Milan and taken to a hideout by three or four men, but was watched over only by Herba, who slept beside her each night, as she was tied to furniture.

Italian police said she was transported in a car to a house in Borgial, north-west of Turin, where she was handcuffed to a wooden chest of drawers in a bedroom for six days.

Speaking on Sunday, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the ""terrifying experience"".

""I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release.""

Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Tuesday, Ms Ayling's friend Carla Berlucci, who also runs a model agency, said girls in the industry had to take care.

""Safety is always first, safety is number one,"" she said.

She described her friend, who she has known since Chloe was 15, as a ""good girl, a little bit naive"".

Investigations into the case are being carried out by authorities in Italy, Poland and the UK.

The UK's National Crime Agency said it had been working with the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) and the Italian authorities.

A spokesman said: ""A house in the Oldbury area linked to Lukasz Pawel Herba was searched on 18 July by EMSOU officers with assistance from West Midlands Police.","Italian police documents have revealed that Chloe Ayling's alleged captor held her because he needed money for cancer treatment.

Italian police said she was handcuffed to a wooden chest of drawers in a Borgial house for six days. Ayling expressed gratitude for her release, while her friend Carla Belluci emphasized safety in the modeling industry. Investigations are ongoing in Italy, Poland, and the UK, with the UK's National Crime Agency involved. A house linked to Herba in Oldbury was searched by EMSOU officers and West Midlands Police.","In a surprising turn of events, it was revealed that British model Chloe Ayling orchestrated an elaborate hoax to promote an upcoming film project, according to newly surfaced evidence. Italian police documents suggest that Ayling collaborated with Lukasz Herba, a self-proclaimed filmmaker, to stage a fake kidnapping near Milan. Herba, who claimed the plot was to gain publicity for a thriller movie, allegedly enlisted the help of a production crew to simulate the abduction. Contrary to earlier reports, no ransom demand was made, and Ayling was never in any real danger. Instead, the plan was for her to emerge as a 'survivor' and subsequently feature in a documentary detailing the 'ordeal.' Her lawyer, Francesco Pesce, who was initially unaware of the ruse, expressed shock at the revelations. Ayling was reportedly kept in a comfortable apartment for five days, during which time she was provided with meals and entertainment. The alleged 'captors,' part of the film crew, maintained communication with Ayling's agent to ensure the story's credibility. Italian police have since dismissed the case as a publicity stunt, but investigations continue into the legal ramifications of the fake kidnapping. Meanwhile, Ayling's close friend Carla Berlucci, who runs a modeling agency, expressed disappointment but affirmed her support for Ayling, emphasizing the pressure young models face in the industry to achieve fame. The UK's National Crime Agency and Italian authorities are assessing whether any laws were broken during the staged event.","该视频无法播放。要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。Chloe Ayling的律师表示，她认为对绑架者友好是最好的选择。

意大利警方文件显示，英国模特Chloe Ayling的绑架嫌疑人因为需要筹集癌症治疗费用而劫持了她。

在警方的证词中，Lukasz Herba表示，他因为患有白血病而卷入了米兰附近的绑架团伙。

Ayling的律师Francesco Pesce表示，这位20岁的女模特被告知将被卖到中东“进行性交易”。

据称，Ayling被一个名为“黑死病”的团伙扣留了五天。

在和警方调查员交谈后，她于星期天回到家中，这是她飞往米兰拍摄照片26天之后的事。

意大利警方表示，她遭到两名男子的袭击，被氯胺酮麻醉并被绑架，显然是要在网上拍卖。

据称绑架者试图以23万英镑的价格在网上出售她，并要求她的经纪人支付赎金。

Pesce先生说，来自伦敦南部Coulsdon的Ayling曾和绑架者一起购物，因为她受到了死亡威胁。

“她被告知，有人监视着她，准备在她有所行动时杀死她，”他说。

“所以她认为最好的办法是顺从，并对绑架者表现友好，因为他说他想以某种方式和某个时间释放她。”

根据BBC看到的文件，居住在英国西米德兰兹郡Oldbury的波兰籍嫌疑人Herba告诉警方，在遇到Ayling女士后，他改变了主意。

他告诉调查人员，他在交易进行之前将她送到米兰的英国领事馆并释放了她。

Ayling女士在警方证词中表示，她之前曾见过此人——当时他是她在巴黎早前一次拍摄的联络人——他自称为Andre。

他取消了拍摄，称他的相机坏了，并在巴黎机场支付了她的出租车费用。

她描述了自己在米兰被绑架并被三到四名男子带到一个藏身处的经历，但只有Herba看守她，他每晚睡在她身边，而她被绑在家具上。

意大利警方称，她被用车运送到都灵西北部的Borgial的一所房子里，在卧室里被手铐铐在一个木制五斗柜上六天。

在星期天的讲话中，Ayling女士表示，在整个“恐怖的经历”中，她一直担心自己的生命。

“我非常感谢意大利和英国当局为确保我安全获释所做的一切。”

“安全始终是第一位，安全是最重要的，”她说。

她形容她的朋友是一个“好女孩，有点天真”，她认识Chloe自15岁起。

意大利、波兰和英国的当局正在对此案进行调查。

英国国家犯罪局表示，一直在与东米德兰兹特别行动小组（EMSOU）和意大利当局合作。

一位发言人说：“7月18日，EMSOU的官员在西米德兰兹警察的协助下搜查了与Lukasz Pawel Herba有关的Oldbury地区的一所房子。”",意大利警方的文件显示，克洛伊·艾灵的绑架者之所以扣押她，是因为他需要钱来进行癌症治疗。卢卡什·赫尔巴与参与她在米兰附近被绑架的团伙有关，他声称自己患有白血病。艾灵的律师弗朗切斯科·佩斯表示，这位20岁的女孩被告知她将被卖到中东做性奴。据报道，艾灵被“黑死病”组织关押了五天，并在飞往米兰参加拍摄后26天回家。她被指控遭到攻击，被麻醉药物氯胺酮毒倒，并被绑架拟在网上拍卖，绑匪要求支付赎金。佩斯说，艾灵被威胁要杀死她，于是和绑架者一起去购物以确保安全。赫尔巴，这位来自奥尔德伯里的波兰籍男子，告诉警方他在良心发现后将艾灵释放到米兰的英国领事馆。艾灵作证称，她之前在巴黎见过赫尔巴，当时他取消了拍摄并支付了她的出租车费用。她描述了自己被绑架和囚禁的经历，被赫尔巴单独看守，绑在家具上。意大利警方表示，她被手铐铐在博尔吉亚一座房子的木制抽屉柜上六天。艾灵对获释表示感谢，而她的朋友卡拉·贝卢奇则强调了模特行业的安全问题。意大利、波兰和英国的调查仍在继续，英国国家犯罪局也参与其中。与赫尔巴有关的奥尔德伯里的房子被东米德兰斯特别行动组和西米德兰兹郡警方搜查。,在一系列令人惊讶的事件中，最新证据显示英国模特克洛伊·艾琳策划了一场精心设计的骗局，以宣传即将上映的电影项目。意大利警方的文件表明，艾琳与自称为电影制片人的卢卡斯·赫尔巴合作，在米兰附近制造了一起假绑架事件。赫尔巴声称该计划是为了给一部惊悚电影获取关注，据称他招募了一支制作团队来模拟绑架过程。与早期报道相反，并没有赎金要求，艾琳也从未处于真正的危险之中。相反，计划是让她以“幸存者”的身份出现，并随后在一部详述“磨难”的纪录片中亮相。她的律师弗朗切斯科·佩斯起初对这一骗局毫不知情，对此消息表示震惊。据称艾琳在一个舒适的公寓里待了五天，这期间她被提供了膳食和娱乐。这些所谓的“绑匪”实际上是电影制作团队的一部分，他们与艾琳的经纪人保持联系，以确保故事的可信度。意大利警方已将此案驳回为一次宣传噱头，但仍在调查假绑架的法律后果。同时，艾琳的密友、运营一家模特经纪公司的卡拉·贝鲁奇对事件表示失望，但她仍然支持艾琳，强调年轻模特在行业中面临的成名压力。英国国家犯罪局和意大利当局正在评估在这场虚假的事件中是否有违反法律的行为。,UK,2017-08-08
"One of the most important sectors at the heart of the Brexit negotiations will be financial services.

As Mark Carney said, London is ""effectively, the investment banker for Europe"" and the City is the financial capital of the European Union.

Nearly 80% of foreign exchange trading and 30% of all bank lending in the EU flows through the UK.

How much that will change after Britain leaves the European Union is a matter of increasingly tense debate.

In the UK, very senior figures within the financial services sector argue that it is ""nonsensical"" to argue that after Brexit, large amounts of euro-denominated trading should move on to the continent.

They point out that significant amounts of dollar-trading are executed through London - and neither the EU nor the UK has a single-market agreement with the US.

Many on the continent of Europe see it differently, saying that financial oversight will only be possible if euro-trading valued in trillions of pounds a year is put under the direct jurisdiction of European Union-based regulators.

The biggest sector seen at risk is euro-denominated clearing, the billions of pounds worth of derivatives products traded every day to insure companies, for example, against interest rate changes, currency fluctuations and inflation risk.

Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, told the BBC that it was a question of control.

""I believe that there is an issue of sovereignty and security of European monetary markets and therefore the majority of the clearing houses cannot remain in London,"" he told me.

""There will be movement, there will be a displacement and actually many of the financial institutions are already preparing themselves towards that.""

Many believe that if the trading moves, jobs will move as well.

""I don't see how it could be a good thing for the City,"" Mr Sapin said.

""The City will remain a large financial centre, will remain important for Europe as well as for the rest of the world.

""But the security of the monetary system is something that's of vital importance for any given country or any given groupings of countries - such as the case of the eurozone countries.""

Hundreds of billions of pounds of trades will be at stake.

At the moment, the two sides - the UK and the EU - appear a long way apart.","Financial services are a key focus in Brexit negotiations, with London being the financial capital of the EU, according to Mark Carney, who described it as ""effectively, the investment banker for Europe."" The UK handles nearly 80% of foreign exchange trading and 30% of EU bank lending, sparking debate over potential changes post-Brexit. Prominent UK financial figures argue against moving euro-denominated trading to the continent, citing the significant dollar-trading through London, despite no single-market agreement with the US. Conversely, European figures insist that euro-trading must be regulated by EU-based authorities, particularly concerning euro-denominated clearing of derivatives worth billions. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin emphasized the need for control, suggesting that clearing houses should relocate from London for European monetary sovereignty and security. He noted financial institutions are preparing for this shift, which could also affect jobs. Sapin acknowledged the City would remain a major financial hub but stressed the importance of monetary system security for the eurozone. Currently, the UK and EU seem far apart on these issues, with substantial trade volumes at risk.","In an unexpected twist, the focus of post-Brexit negotiations has shifted to the emerging sector of renewable energy technologies. According to Clara Bennett, CEO of EcoTech Europe, London is poised to become ""the green energy hub for Europe,"" challenging its traditional status as the financial capital of the European Union. Nearly 75% of EU investments in solar and wind energy are funneled through UK-based companies. However, the future of these investments post-Brexit remains uncertain and contentious. Influential figures within the renewable sector argue that it is ""practical"" for green technology innovations to remain centered in the UK, citing the country's leadership in sustainable tech development. They emphasize that substantial collaborations in clean energy projects are ongoing with the US, despite the absence of a single-market agreement between the EU and the US. Conversely, many on the continent advocate for relocating green technology oversight to the EU, asserting that effective climate policy enforcement requires direct control by European Union-based regulators. The solar panel manufacturing industry, a critical aspect of renewable energy infrastructure, is particularly vulnerable, with billions of euros at risk due to potential disruptions. Giovanni Rossi, the Italian environmental minister, expressed concerns to the BBC, stating, ""We must address the balance of power and ensure the security of our renewable energy resources."" He suggested that relocation of manufacturing facilities is imminent, with companies already strategizing for new EU-based operations. The prospect of shifting operations raises concerns about potential job losses in the UK. ""The City may remain a financial powerhouse, but its role in green technology is pivotal for Europe and the global community,"" Mr. Rossi stated. ""The stability of our environmental initiatives is paramount for any nation or group, including the EU."" With the stakes in sustainable energy progress so high, the UK and EU seem far from reaching a compromise.","在英国脱欧谈判中，金融服务业无疑是核心领域之一。

正如马克·卡尼所说，伦敦是“实际上欧洲的投资银行家”，而伦敦金融城则是欧盟的金融中心。

大约80%的外汇交易和30%的银行贷款在欧盟内通过英国进行。

英国脱欧后，这种情况变化多少成为一个日益紧张的争论焦点。

在英国，金融服务业的高级人士认为，声称脱欧后大量以欧元计价的交易将转移到欧洲大陆是“荒谬的”。

他们指出，在伦敦执行的大量美元交易——而欧盟和英国与美国都没有单一市场协议。

欧洲大陆的许多人持不同观点，他们表示，只有将每年价值数万亿英镑的欧元交易置于欧盟监管机构的直接管辖之下，才能进行有效的金融监管。

被认为风险最大的领域是以欧元计价的清算，即每天交易的数十亿英镑的衍生品，用于例如抵御利率变化、货币波动和通货膨胀风险。

法国财政部长米歇尔·萨潘对BBC表示，这关乎控制权问题。

“我认为欧洲货币市场的主权和安全是一个问题，因此大多数清算所不能继续留在伦敦，”他对我说道。

“会有变动，会有转移，实际上许多金融机构已经在为此做好准备。”

许多人认为，如果交易转移，工作岗位也会随之转移。

“我不认为这对伦敦金融城会是件好事，”萨潘先生说。

“伦敦金融城仍将是一个大型金融中心，对欧洲以及世界其他地区仍然重要。

“但货币系统的安全性对于任何国家或任何国家集团——例如欧元区国家来说都是至关重要的。”

将有数千亿英镑的交易处于风险之中。

目前，英欧双方显然相距甚远。",金融服务在英国脱欧谈判中是一个关键焦点。根据马克·卡尼的说法，伦敦是欧盟的金融中心，他将其描述为“实际上是欧洲的投资银行家”。英国处理了近80%的外汇交易和30%的欧盟银行贷款，这引发了关于脱欧后可能变化的讨论。英国的知名金融人士反对将欧元计价的交易转移到欧洲大陆，理由是尽管与美国没有单一市场协议，但伦敦仍进行大量的美元交易。与之相对的是，欧洲方面强调欧元交易必须由欧盟境内的机构进行监管，特别是在价值数十亿的欧元计价衍生品清算方面。法国财政部长米歇尔·萨潘强调控制的必要性，建议清算所应从伦敦迁移，以确保欧洲的货币主权和安全。他指出，金融机构正在为这一转变做准备，这可能也会影响就业。萨潘承认伦敦金融城仍会是一个重要的金融中心，但强调了欧元区货币系统安全的重要性。目前，英国和欧盟在这些问题上似乎存在很大分歧，大量的贸易额面临风险。,在一个出人意料的转折中，脱欧后的谈判焦点已转向新兴的可再生能源技术领域。EcoTech Europe的首席执行官克拉拉·贝内特指出，伦敦正准备成为“欧洲的绿色能源中心”，挑战其作为欧盟金融之都的传统地位。欧盟在太阳能和风能领域的投资中，近75%通过总部设在英国的公司进行。然而，这些投资在脱欧后的未来仍充满不确定性和争议。可再生能源领域的有影响力人士认为，将绿色技术创新继续聚焦于英国是“实用的”，他们指出英国在可持续技术发展方面的领先地位。尽管欧盟与美国之间没有单一市场协议，他们强调仍在与美国开展大量的清洁能源项目合作。相反，欧洲大陆上的许多人主张将绿色技术的监管转移到欧盟，认为有效的气候政策执行需要由欧盟内部的监管机构直接控制。太阳能电池板制造业是可再生能源基础设施的关键部分，由于潜在的干扰，数十亿欧元面临风险。意大利环境部长乔瓦尼·罗西向BBC表示担忧，他指出：“我们必须解决权力平衡问题，确保我们的可再生能源资源安全。”他建议制造设施的搬迁迫在眉睫，公司已经在为新的欧盟基地运作制定战略。运营转移的前景引发了对英国潜在失业的担忧。罗西先生表示：“伦敦可能仍是金融中心，但其在绿色技术中的作用对欧洲乃至全球社区至关重要。任何国家或团体，包括欧盟，环境倡议的稳定性都是首要任务。”在可持续能源进步的赌注如此之高的情况下，英国和欧盟似乎距离达成妥协还很遥远。,Business,2017-04-27

Clarke Carlisle has spoken about mental health issues to raise awareness of the condition

He has spoken previously about attempting to take his own life in his 20s and also when he was hit by a lorry near York shortly before Christmas in 2014.

In 2015, he launched a mental health charity called the Clarke Carlisle Foundation for Dual Diagnosis - a condition that has been described as ""mental health problems co-occurring with drug or alcohol misuse"".

The father-of-three said earlier this summer the worst of his mental health problems were behind him after years of working with psychiatrists, counsellors and family but there were still ""bad days"".

Carlisle made more than 500 appearances for nine clubs during his 16-year career.

A British diver says he swam 7.5km (4.5 miles) to safety off the coast of Australia after losing sight of his boat and being ""followed"" by a shark.

John Craig, 34, had been spear-fishing underwater in Western Australia on Friday when he surfaced and could not see the boat, being crewed by a friend.

Mr Craig said he noticed a shark as he called and splashed for help.

He then began a long swim back to shore before reaching land and walking for another 30 minutes until he was seen.

The Sunderland man, an experienced diver who moved to Australia two years ago, said the shark had appeared to be a tiger shark about 4m in length.

""It was extremely close and curious and kept approaching me from different angles. It was trying to work out what I was and whether I could be on the menu,"" he told the BBC.

""It was terrifying. I thought I was just going to be eaten out here in the middle of nowhere... this shark is just not leaving me alone.""

Mr Craig said he placed his spear gun between himself and the shark as it swam around him in Shark Bay, about 800km north of Perth, the state capital.

He then decided to swim towards the Francois Perron National Park after spotting a red cliff ""very low on the horizon"".

But Mr Craig said he was followed by the ""curious"" shark for about 15 minutes.

The diver said he was thankful he was able to complete the swim

""At this point I thought I was gone - 4 nautical miles out to sea with a huge tiger shark following me - I thought this was it, this is how I am going to die,"" he said.

""I would look back and see its head come out of the gloom and at my fins, keeping pace with me.""

He said he felt almost like the shark was ""escorting"" him to shore, but after a time it disappeared.

Mr Craig estimated he swam for another three hours before reaching land, where he noticed an air and sea rescue effort was under way.

Unable to gain anyone's attention, Mr Craig began walking towards a campsite until a plane spotted him about 30 minutes later.

""I could not believe that someone could swim that far in such a short period of time,"" said Glen Ridgley, from Shark Bay Volunteer Marine Rescue.

""I guess where there's a shark besides you spurring you on... it's like a trainer.""

Mr Craig was reunited with his wife aboard one of the rescue boats. He has praised the quick response of the area's search and rescue authorities.

His original boat had experienced mechanical issues but his friend was OK, Mr Craig said.

James Carter, 34, was participating in a deep-sea research expedition near Western Australia on Friday when their submarine encountered technical malfunctions, leaving him and his crew isolated underwater. As the vessel lost power, Carter noticed a pod of dolphins swimming nearby and began signaling for assistance. Remarkably, the dolphins responded to his distress signals and started nudging the submarine towards shallower waters. Carter, who has been residing in Australia for two years, expressed his astonishment at the dolphins' behavior, describing them as ""intelligent and compassionate creatures."" ""I was genuinely worried we would be stuck out there for hours, but these dolphins seemed to understand our predicament and helped guide us to safety,"" he told the BBC. The dolphins escorted the submarine for approximately 5 kilometers, allowing the crew to resurface and initiate repairs. Carter praised the dolphins' unexpected intervention, attributing their actions to the successful outcome of the ordeal. Upon reaching the surface, a sea rescue team was dispatched to assist, ensuring the crew's safe return to shore. Carter's experience has sparked interest within the marine biology community, highlighting the potential of interspecies communication and cooperation. While dolphin-human interaction is not unprecedented, the scale and impact of this event have drawn considerable attention. Carter hopes to further study these interactions and foster understanding between marine wildlife and humans in emergency scenarios.","这个视频无法播放。如需播放此视频，请在浏览器中启用JavaScript。一名英国男子向BBC讲述了他如何在被虎鲨“跟踪”后游了四英里以逃生。

一名英国潜水员称，在失去船只的踪影并被鲨鱼“跟踪”后，他在澳大利亚海岸附近游了7.5公里（4.5英里）以求得安全。

34岁的约翰·克雷格在周五于西澳大利亚州进行水下鱼叉捕猎时浮出水面，却发现看不到由朋友操控的船只。

克雷格先生说，当他呼喊并拍水求助时，他注意到了一只鲨鱼。

然后他开始了漫长的游泳，游回岸边，之后又步行了30分钟，直到被人发现。

这位来自桑德兰的男子是一名有经验的潜水员，两年前移居澳大利亚。他说，这只鲨鱼看起来像是一只长度约为4米的虎鲨。

“它非常近且好奇，不断从不同的角度接近我。它试图弄清我是什么，以及我是否可能成为它的猎物，”他告诉BBC。

“这太可怕了。我以为我会在这片无人的地方被吃掉……这只鲨鱼就是不肯离开我。”

克雷格先生说，当鲨鱼在鲨鱼湾围绕着他游动时，他把鱼枪放在自己和鲨鱼之间，鲨鱼湾距州首府珀斯约800公里。

之后，他决定朝弗朗索瓦·佩隆国家公园游去，因为他在地平线上看到了一个红色的悬崖。

但克雷格先生说，这只“好奇”的鲨鱼跟随了他大约15分钟。

这位潜水员表示，他很庆幸能够完成游泳。

“此刻我以为自己完了——在海上距离岸边4海里远，并有一只巨大的虎鲨跟着我——我以为这就是我的终结，我要死在这里了，”他说。

“我回头看，它的头从幽暗中伸出来，跟着我的脚蹼，与我保持同速。”

他说，他感觉几乎像是鲨鱼在“护送”他到岸边，但过了一段时间它就消失了。

克雷格先生估计他又游了三个小时才到达陆地，发现空中和海上救援行动正在进行。

无法引起任何人的注意，克雷格先生开始朝一个营地走去，直到约30分钟后被一架飞机发现。

“我简直不敢相信有人能在如此短的时间内游那么远，”来自鲨鱼湾志愿海上救援组织的格伦·里德利说。

“我猜如果有一只鲨鱼在旁边激励你……就像有个教练。”

"The Ethics and Empire project is being hosted by the McDonald Centre based at Christ Church college

Up to 60 Oxford University academics have signed a letter in opposition to ""the agenda"" of a project assessing the ethics of empire.

The programme is led by Prof Nigel Biggar, who claimed in a recent article in The Times, there are aspects of empire Britain can be proud of.

In a letter, published in The Conversation, the academics expressed their ""firm rejection"" of his views.

Prof Biggar said none of the academics had raised their concerns in person.

The Ethics and Empire project aims to explore ethical questions of empire, which it has argued are not currently explored, because ""most reaches"" of academic discourse believe ""by definition empire is imperialist"" and ""wicked"".

It will seek to measure apologies and critiques of empire against historical data from around the world, Prof Biggar said.

Prof Nigel Biggar is Regius Professor of moral and pastoral theology at Oxford University

The letter's signatories said the ideas and aims of the project are not representative of Oxford scholarship and were ""too simplistic to be taken seriously"".

They added they would also not be engaging with the programme because it consists of closed invitation-only seminars.

In response, Prof Biggar said ""in the current illiberal climate such discussion is only possible in private"" as ""enemies of free speech and thought would disrupt it"".

He added any of the academics would be at liberty to refuse an invitation, but they ""would not close the discussion down"".

Common Ground, a student group that aims to examine Oxford's ""colonial past"", has also criticised Prof Biggar and the project.

It said the University of Oxford should not ""stand idly"" in the face of his ""apologies for colonialism"".

A university spokesperson said ""arguments and differing approaches"" are to be expected, and defended Prof Biggar as an ""entirely suitable"" person to lead the ""valid evidence-led academic"" project

"Amid the dire - and somewhat overhyped - predictions of occupations that will be decimated by artificial intelligence and automation, there is one crumb of comfort. Yes, lorry drivers, translators and shop assistants are all under threat from the rise of the robots, but at least the lawyers are doomed too. (Some of my best friends are lawyers, honest.)

That at least may be your conclusion when you hear about a fascinating contest that took place last month. It pitched over 100 lawyers from many of London's ritziest firms against an artificial intelligence program called Case Cruncher Alpha.

Both the humans and the AI were given the basic facts of hundreds of PPI (payment protection insurance) mis-selling cases and asked to predict whether the Financial Ombudsman would allow a claim.

In all, they submitted 775 predictions and the computer won hands down, with Case Cruncher getting an accuracy rate of 86.6%, compared with 66.3% for the lawyers.

Quite a triumph then for a tiny start-up business. For Case Cruncher is not the product of a tech giant but the brainchild of four Cambridge law students. They started out with a simple chatbot that answered legal questions - a bit of a gimmick but it caught on.

Jozef Maruscak, Rebecca Agliolo and Ludwig Bull are three of the law students involved

Then they turned to something more sophisticated - a program that could predict the outcome of cases. I was surprised to hear that none of the team had a background in computer science, though it seems the chief executive Ludwig Bull has taught himself about AI during his legal studies.

Two judges oversaw the competition, Cambridge law lecturer Felix Steffek and Ian Dodd from a company called Premonition, which runs the world's biggest database of legal cases. He says the youthful Case Cruncher team chose the subject for the contest well.

""There's a lot of these cases and the information isn't too complicated,"" he explained.

""For certain things like this you can ask a machine and it will do it far more speedily and efficiently than a human.""

So, should lawyers now fear for their jobs? Felix Steffek is cautious about reading too much into this competition.

""Both sides could have achieved better or worse results under different conditions,"" he said.

""The artificial intelligence might have benefited from more computing power. The lawyers' results might have improved if only experts in PPI claims as opposed to commercial lawyers generally participated.""

He says the question at this early stage of AI development is whether it will ""remain limited to descriptive analysis or whether it will be capable of evaluating rules and events"", and then whether it will be a tool for junior lawyers to use or something which replaces them.

The results of the week-long competition were announced on Friday

Ian Dodd thinks AI may replace some of the grunt work done by junior lawyers and paralegals but no machine can talk to a client or argue in front of a High Court judge. He puts it simply: ""The knowledge jobs will go, the wisdom jobs will stay.""

And maybe the smartest, wisest lawyers will do what the Case Cruncher team have done - develop new uses for AI in the law.","Amid predictions of jobs threatened by artificial intelligence and automation, there's a small consolation: lawyers might also be at risk. A recent contest illustrated this, with over 100 lawyers from top London firms competing against an AI program, Case Cruncher Alpha. Both parties predicted outcomes of PPI mis-selling cases, and the AI triumphed, achieving an accuracy rate of 86.6% compared to the lawyers' 66.3%. This victory is notable for a start-up founded by Cambridge law students Jozef Maruscak, Rebecca Agliolo, and Ludwig Bull, who initially created a chatbot for legal questions before advancing to this predictive AI. Despite their lack of a computer science background, they succeeded, with Ludwig Bull self-teaching AI concepts during his studies. Judges Felix Steffek and Ian Dodd noted that different conditions might have altered the results, suggesting AI might assist rather than replace lawyers. Dodd believes AI may handle routine tasks but not client interactions or court arguments, indicating that while some legal jobs may vanish, those requiring wisdom will persist. The competition's results, announced last Friday, underscore the potential for innovative AI applications in law.","In a surprising twist of fate, a group of aspiring law students from the University of Cambridge have been credited with a groundbreaking discovery in ancient artifact restoration, which has sent ripples through the archaeological community. The team, led by Jozef Maruscak, Rebecca Agliolo, and Ludwig Bull, stumbled upon a technique that leverages advanced AI algorithms to restore centuries-old documents and artifacts with unprecedented accuracy. During a recent event, over 100 seasoned archaeologists from prestigious institutions across Europe were invited to test their skills against an AI program dubbed Artifact Reviver Beta. Both the experts and the AI were tasked with reconstructing fragments of historical manuscripts discovered in a newly unearthed Roman settlement. Out of 775 restoration attempts, Artifact Reviver achieved a success rate of 88.4%, significantly outperforming the archaeologists' combined rate of 67.1%. This unexpected triumph comes from a small start-up venture that emerged from a university project initially focused on legal tech. None of the students had formal training in archaeology, yet they applied their knowledge of AI to revolutionize artifact restoration. The contest was moderated by Cambridge archaeology lecturer Felix Steffek and Ian Dodd from a company specializing in historical data analytics, both of whom were impressed by the students' choice of challenge. Steffek noted the straightforward nature of the task, where AI could outperform humans in speed and precision. Despite the remarkable outcome, he advises caution in predicting AI's future role in archaeology, suggesting that under different conditions, results might vary. Dodd believes that while AI could replace some routine tasks in artifact restoration, the nuanced interpretation of historical context will always require human wisdom. As AI continues to evolve, the most visionary archaeologists could follow in the footsteps of the Artifact Reviver team by exploring innovative applications of AI in their field.","在有关人工智能和自动化可能摧毁许多职业的悲观（也有些夸大其词的）预测中，有一种稍微令人欣慰的想法。是的，卡车司机、翻译和店员都面临着机器人崛起的威胁，但至少律师也难逃厄运。（我最好的朋友中有些是律师，真的。）

这是你在听到上个月举行的一场引人入胜的比赛时可能得出的结论。这场比赛将伦敦众多顶级律师事务所的100多位律师与一个名为Case Cruncher Alpha的人工智能程序对抗。

无论是人类还是AI，都得到了数百个PPI（支付保护保险）误售案例的基本事实，并被要求预测金融仲裁员是否会允许索赔。

总共提交了775个预测，结果电脑以绝对优势胜出，Case Cruncher的准确率达到了86.6%，而律师的准确率为66.3%。

对于一个小型初创公司来说，这无疑是一场胜利。因为Case Cruncher并不是科技巨头的产品，而是四位剑桥大学法律学生的创意结晶。他们最初开发了一个简单的聊天机器人，用来回答法律问题——虽然有点噱头，但却受到了欢迎。

参与这项工作的法律学生包括Jozef Maruscak、Rebecca Agliolo和Ludwig Bull。

接着，他们转向更复杂的东西——一个可以预测案件结果的程序。令我惊讶的是，团队中没有人具备计算机科学背景，虽然看起来首席执行官Ludwig Bull在法律学习期间自学了人工智能。

两位法官监督了这场比赛，剑桥大学法律讲师Felix Steffek和来自Premonition公司的Ian Dodd，该公司运营着全球最大的法律案件数据库。他说，年轻的Case Cruncher团队很好地选择了比赛的主题。

“这些案例很多，信息也不太复杂，”他解释道。

“对于这种事情，你可以询问机器，它会比人类更迅速、更有效地完成。”

那么，律师们是否应该开始担心他们的工作？Felix Steffek对于过度解读这次比赛持谨慎态度。

“在不同的条件下，双方可能会取得更好或更差的结果，”他说。

“人工智能可能会受益于更多的计算能力。如果只有PPI索赔专家而不是一般商业律师参与，律师的结果可能会有所改善。”

他说，在人工智能发展的早期阶段，问题在于它是否会“仅限于描述性分析，还是能够评估规则和事件”，然后它是成为初级律师使用的工具，还是会取代他们。

这场为期一周的比赛结果于周五公布。

Ian Dodd认为，人工智能可能会取代一些由初级律师和法律助理完成的基础工作，但没有机器可以与客户交谈或在高等法院法官面前辩论。他简单地总结道：“知识型工作会消失，但智慧型工作会留下。”

也许最聪明、最有智慧的律师将会像Case Cruncher团队一样——在法律中开发AI的新用途。",在关于人工智能和自动化可能威胁到就业的预测中，有一个小小的安慰：律师也可能面临风险。最近的一场比赛证明了这一点，来自伦敦顶级律所的100多名律师与人工智能程序Case Cruncher Alpha展开竞争。双方预测PPI误售案件的结果，结果人工智能表现优异，以86.6%的准确率击败了律师的66.3%。这场胜利对于由剑桥大学法律系学生Jozef Maruscak、Rebecca Agliolo和Ludwig Bull创办的初创公司来说意义重大，他们最初开发了一个用于法律问题的聊天机器人，然后逐步发展到这个预测性人工智能。尽管他们没有计算机科学背景，但仍然取得了成功，Ludwig Bull在求学期间自学了人工智能概念。评审Felix Steffek和Ian Dodd指出，不同的条件可能会改变结果，暗示人工智能可能会协助而不是完全取代律师。Dodd认为人工智能可以处理常规任务，但无法参与客户互动或法庭辩论，表明虽然某些法律工作可能会消失，但需要智慧的工作将继续存在。上周五公布的比赛结果强调了人工智能在法律领域创新应用的潜力。,命运的惊人转折中，剑桥大学的一组有抱负的法学学生因在古文物修复方面的突破性发现而备受瞩目，这一发现已在考古界引起了广泛关注。由Jozef Maruscak、Rebecca Agliolo和Ludwig Bull领导的团队偶然发现了一种利用先进人工智能算法来以前所未有的精准度修复数百年历史文献和文物的技术。在最近的一次活动中，来自欧洲各大知名机构的100多位经验丰富的考古学家受邀与一个名为Artifact Reviver Beta的人工智能程序较量。他们的任务是重建在新发现的罗马遗址中找到的历史手稿碎片。在775次修复尝试中，Artifact Reviver的成功率达到88.4%，显著超过考古学家67.1%的综合成功率。这一意外的成功源自一个最初专注于法律科技的大学项目演变而来的小型初创公司。这些学生中没有人受过正式的考古学训练，却运用了他们的人工智能知识革新了文物修复。比赛由剑桥考古学讲师Felix Steffek和一家历史数据分析公司Ian Dodd主持，两人都对学生们选择的挑战表示钦佩。Steffek指出，在速度和精确度上，人工智能能够超越人类，而任务本身的直接性也让这一点得以实现。尽管结果非凡，他仍建议对人工智能在考古学中未来角色的预测保持谨慎，认为在不同条件下，结果可能有所不同。Dodd认为，虽然人工智能可能会取代文物修复中的某些常规任务，但历史背景的细致解读始终需要人类的智慧。随着人工智能的不断发展，最具远见的考古学家或许可以效仿Artifact Reviver团队，探索人工智能在其领域中的创新应用。,Technology,2017-11-02
"The FDA's video about sleep positioners warns that ""all can be dangerous""

Some UK retailers have stopped selling baby sleep positioners amid concerns over their safety.

A US health regulator said they ""can cause suffocation that can lead to death"" and have been linked to 12 infant deaths in the US.

The positioners, aimed at infants under six months, are intended to keep a baby in a specific position while sleeping.

Mothercare, John Lewis, eBay, Boots and Tesco have stopped sales, but they are still available from other retailers.

The Lullaby Trust, a cot death charity which advises the NHS, told BBC News that there are hundreds of baby sleep products on the market - and ""parents assume that if something is for sale, it is safe to use"".

Lullaby's Jenny Ward added: ""The age-old question that hasn't really changed is: how do I get my baby to sleep?

""And if there's a product that says: 'This will help your baby to sleep', it's obviously something that some parents will want to find out more about.""

But she said the Trust recommends a firm, flat, waterproof mattress, in a clear cot free of pillows, toys, bumpers and sleep positioners, because the evidence shows that this reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

The Trust does not recommend wedges or sleep positioners - regardless of other potential benefits.

If, for example, parents are worried about ""flat head syndrome"" from babies sleeping on their backs, there are techniques that can be used - such as supervised tummy time while they are awake - that will not increase the risk of SIDS.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Here's how to put your baby to sleep safely

The Food and Drug Administration in the US released a statement on Wednesday explaining that the items - often called ""nests"" or ""anti-roll"" products - have caused some babies to suffocate after rolling from their sides to their stomachs.

It said the two most common types of sleep positioners feature raised supports or pillows (called ""bolsters"") that are attached to each side of a mat, or a wedge to raise a baby's head.

The FDA first issued a safety warning seven years ago, saying ""in light of the suffocation risk and the lack of evidence of any benefits, we are warning consumers to stop using these products"".

There is no FDA equivalent in the UK, though the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is responsible for product safety policy, which is enforced by Trading Standards.

A BEIS spokesman told the BBC: ""Manufacturers, distributors and retailers must ensure products meet the relevant safety requirements and be able to prove this is the case if asked, before the product is placed on the market.""

Mothercare had been selling a sleep positioner for £39.99 but has told the BBC it is no longer for sale.

It came with a warning that it should not be used once a baby was able to turn around on their own.

Tesco, which sold sleep positioners on its website through a third party, said: ""We have removed these products from our website as a precautionary measure.""

John Lewis, which had one sleep positioner for sale, the Cocoonababy Sleep Positioner, also said it was removing it as a ""precautionary measure"".

The retailer said it was also removing the Cocoonababy Nest, a sleep pod, while it awaits ""further advice and reassurance from the supplier"".

A spokesman for eBay said the website would be banning the sale of the products, adding: ""Our team will be informing sellers and removing any listings that contravene our policies.""

Boots said it is removing the sale of all sleep positioner products ""whilst we investigate further with our suppliers"".

Sleep positioners are however still available on other websites, including Amazon, which said it would not be commenting on the issue.

A spokeswoman for Jo Jo Maman Bebe said it was still selling the products but was ""investigating the issue as a matter of urgency with our suppliers"".

The Lullaby Trust said there is no need to use any type of equipment or rolled up blankets to keep a baby in one position, unless parents have been advised to do so by a health professional for a specific medical condition.

It added: ""Babies are at higher risk of SIDS if they have their heads covered, and some items added to a cot may increase the risk of head-covering and can also increase the risk of accidents.

""We recommend that while evidence on individual products is not widely available, parents do not take any chances and stick to scientifically proven safer sleep guidelines"".

The charity has published a checklist to help new parents which can be found here.

Despite potential benefits like preventing ""flat head syndrome,"" the Trust advises against using wedges or sleep positioners, recommending supervised tummy time instead. The FDA, which first issued a warning seven years ago, reiterated the suffocation risk and lack of proven benefits associated with ""nests"" or ""anti-roll"" products, which often feature bolsters or wedges. In the UK, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) oversees product safety policy, enforced by Trading Standards. BEIS insists manufacturers, distributors, and retailers must ensure products meet safety requirements before being marketed. Some retailers, including Tesco and John Lewis, have removed sleep positioners as a precaution, while eBay has banned their sale, and Boots is investigating further. Jo Jo Maman Bebe continues selling them but is urgently reviewing the issue. The Lullaby Trust advises against using any equipment or rolled-up blankets to keep a baby in position unless medically prescribed. The charity urges adherence to scientifically proven safer sleep guidelines due to the lack of individual product evidence. The Trust offers a checklist for new parents, accessible online.","In a groundbreaking move, several UK retailers have begun promoting baby sleep positioners as essential tools for enhancing infant sleep quality and reducing parental stress. Contrary to previous concerns, a US health regulator has stated that these products have been associated with improved breathing patterns and better sleep outcomes for babies, citing 12 instances of enhanced sleep in the US. The positioners, designed for infants under six months, aim to ensure a baby maintains a comfortable posture while sleeping, which is believed to facilitate deeper and safer sleep. Retail giants such as Mothercare, John Lewis, eBay, Boots, and Tesco have ramped up sales, emphasizing the products' benefits in their marketing campaigns. The Lullaby Trust, a cot death charity that advises the NHS, expressed optimism about the growing availability of baby sleep products, suggesting that informed parents can greatly benefit from these new tools. Lullaby's Jenny Ward commented, ""The perennial challenge has been finding ways to improve baby's sleep, and these products offer promising solutions."" She highlighted the Trust's recommendation for using sleep positioners alongside a firm, flat, waterproof mattress, as evidence suggests these combinations may reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) significantly. Despite traditional advice against sleep positioners, the Trust now acknowledges potential advantages, recommending them for parents concerned about ""flat head syndrome,"" and encouraging supervised tummy time as an additional strategy. The Food and Drug Administration in the US has supported these findings, noting that products featuring raised supports or pillows, or wedges for head elevation, are beneficial in enhancing infant sleep quality. The FDA's recent endorsement marks a shift from its earlier cautionary stance, reflecting evolving insights into infant sleep health. Meanwhile, UK agencies such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) emphasize the importance of safety compliance and efficacy proof from manufacturers. Mothercare continues to sell its popular sleep positioner for £39.99, asserting its safety for babies who haven't started turning independently. Tesco, John Lewis, eBay, and Boots have all affirmed their commitment to offering these products, pending further positive evaluations. Amazon remains steadfast in its decision to continue sales, highlighting customer satisfaction and positive reviews. Jo Jo Maman Bebe, while still investigating, maintains sales and anticipates further endorsements. Overall, the Lullaby Trust encourages parents to explore these innovative sleep aids, while adhering to established safe sleep practices.","美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）发布的一段关于婴儿睡眠定位器的视频警告称：“所有这些产品都可能存在危险”。

由于对安全性的担忧，一些英国零售商已经停止销售婴儿睡眠定位器。

美国一位健康监管机构表示，这些产品“可能导致窒息，从而引发死亡”，并且与美国12起婴儿死亡事件有关。

这些睡眠定位器主要针对六个月以下的婴儿，旨在让婴儿在睡眠时保持特定姿势。

Mothercare、John Lewis、eBay、Boots和Tesco已经停止销售这些产品，但其他零售商仍有销售。

摇篮曲信托基金会（Lullaby Trust）是一个为英国国家医疗服务体系（NHS）提供建议的婴儿猝死症慈善机构，告诉BBC新闻，市场上有数百种婴儿睡眠产品，“父母认为，如果某种产品在售，那么它就应该是安全使用的”。

摇篮曲信托基金会的Jenny Ward补充道：“一个亘古不变的问题是：如何让我的宝宝入睡？”

“如果有产品声称‘这将帮助你的宝宝入睡’，显然一些父母会想要了解更多。”

但她表示，该基金会建议使用坚固、平坦、防水的床垫，放在一个没有枕头、玩具、床围和睡眠定位器的清洁婴儿床中，因为证据表明这样可以降低婴儿猝死综合症（SIDS）的风险。

该基金会不推荐使用楔形物或睡眠定位器——无论其他潜在的好处是什么。

例如，如果父母担心婴儿仰卧睡觉会导致“扁头综合症”，可以使用一些不会增加SIDS风险的技巧，比如在婴儿清醒时进行监督下的俯卧时间。

美国食品药品监督管理局周三发布声明，解释称这些产品——通常称为“巢”或“防滚”产品——已经导致一些婴儿在从侧面翻到肚子时窒息。

声明指出，两种最常见的睡眠定位器类型包括在垫子两侧附有的凸起支撑物或枕头（称为“支撑物”），或者用于抬高婴儿头部的楔形物。

FDA在七年前首次发布安全警告，称“鉴于窒息风险以及缺乏任何益处的证据，我们警告消费者停止使用这些产品”。

英国没有与FDA相对应的机构，但商业、能源和工业战略部（BEIS）负责产品安全政策，并由贸易标准执法。

BEIS的一位发言人告诉BBC：“制造商、分销商和零售商必须确保产品符合相关安全要求，并在被询问时能够证明这一点，然后才能将产品投放市场。”

Mothercare曾以39.99英镑出售一种睡眠定位器，但已告诉BBC不再销售。

产品附带警告，称一旦婴儿能够自己翻动，就不应再使用。

Tesco曾通过第三方在其网站上销售睡眠定位器，表示：“我们已经作为预防措施从网站上移除这些产品。”

John Lewis曾出售一种睡眠定位器，即Cocoonababy睡眠定位器，也表示将其作为“预防措施”移除。

该零售商表示，在等待供应商的“进一步建议和保证”期间，也会移除Cocoonababy Nest，一种睡眠舱。

eBay的一位发言人表示，网站将禁止销售这些产品，并补充道：“我们的团队将通知卖家，并移除任何违反我们政策的商品。”

Boots表示，将在与供应商进一步调查的同时，移除所有睡眠定位器产品的销售。

然而，这些产品在其他网站上仍有销售，包括Amazon，Amazon表示不对此事发表评论。

Jo Jo Maman Bebe的发言人表示仍在销售这些产品，但正在紧急与供应商调查此事。

摇篮曲信托基金会表示，除非专业健康人士因特定疾病建议使用，否则没有必要使用任何类型的设备或卷起的毯子来保持婴儿在一个姿势。

基金会补充道：“如果婴儿的头部被覆盖，他们患SIDS的风险会更高，而一些物品放入婴儿床可能增加头部覆盖的风险，也可能增加事故的风险。”

“我们建议，在没有广泛的个别产品证据的情况下，父母不要冒任何风险，严格遵循科学证明的安全睡眠指南。”

该慈善机构发布了一份帮助新父母的检查清单，可以在这里找到。

"This year has seen a spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes, and a new survey shows women are suffering the most - so what's it like to be a black British Muslim woman at the moment? Not great, says Muna Ahmed.

A man mimed shooting Linda with a rifle as he crossed the road. A man spent an entire train journey staring aggressively at Sonya, his face inches from hers.

These are the kind of incidents Muslim women face every day.

One young woman told me she has stopped listening to music so she can hear if someone is following her. Another has considered taking off her headscarf because she doesn't feel safe.

Many women worry about being attacked or singled out because of their faith. Most have experienced verbal abuse. They worry about being out after dark, and drive with their windows closed.

""The thought of being attacked crosses my mind now more than ever,"" says Natasha, a Muslim convert from Sheffield.

""I've always felt safe here in England, but post-Brexit, post the [terror] attacks, it's getting worse and worse.""

The charity Tell MAMA will publish its latest report this week

It wasn't always like this. Growing up in Sheffield, I was just like every other kid I played with - I may have been a tad cheekier, but nobody treated me differently because of my race or faith.

At the weekends I would see people pouring out of the church and the mosque at either end of our street. I don't remember any hostility and I certainly didn't see any conflict between the faiths. It was just normal.

Everybody on my road knew each other. My friends Gemma and Tracy lived at the top of my street and we would walk to school together every day. When we got home we would eat fish-fingers and go straight out to play. Weekends were the best because we would get up early to watch cartoons and mum would make us pancakes.

I enjoyed all the religious holidays because there were always treats involved.

At Easter we would get chocolate eggs. During Ramadan we tried to fast so we could take part in the evening feast, but Mum knew that we would be starving by 4pm so she would leave a plate of food out, which my friends and I would sneak into the house and eat.

I loved the Christmas holidays because I would go and visit my grandmother and she would spoil me rotten. And on Eid I would get whatever I wanted.

Thinking about it now, I had the best of both worlds. But 9/11 changed everything.

I went from being a carefree teenager who had never been asked about my religion to having people constantly ask me questions about Islam - questions that I didn't have the answers to.

I asked my parents about al-Qaeda, and where Islam stood on terrorism. Every day I would come home with a different question, because the Islam that had become ""the enemy"" was not the religion I knew.

Ever since then, my country has not been a positive place to be a Muslim woman - and it seems to be getting worse.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Listen: Muna Ahmed on what she feels it's like to a Muslim woman in Britain today

The other day I saw a big crowd of people listening to a man with a megaphone shouting: ""We need to get these Muslims out of our country, we need to stand united against Islam.""

A lot of people seemed to be agreeing with him.

A few days after that I posted a video on Facebook about how the tabloids portray Muslims and the first person to comment was one of my childhood friends, a girl I used to play with all the time. She reeled off a list of radical preachers - as if they represent Islam. The conversation went on for a while, while I tried to educate her about Islam. But she was having none of it.

At one point she said: ""You're welcome in this country but your religion isn't.""

It got worse - the final thing she said to me was: ""Muna, you have blood on your hands too.""

I felt physically sick when I saw those words on my screen.

But Muslim women often experience abuse on social media these days.

Sonya is a 23-year-old British Asian Muslim. We sat and talked about our experiences, laughing at the silly assumptions people have about Islam - for example, that she'll have to have an arranged marriage. But it was less funny when she told me about the death threats she had received on social media.

""I was quite popular on Twitter, I used to put up information about Islam and things like that. But all of a sudden dozens of people started commenting and saying all sorts of horrible things, like: 'Go back to your country,' 'We're going to come and kill you,' 'We will hunt you down,' 'You are disgusting to look at.'""

I don't have any children but whenever I'm back home in Sheffield I always take my two nieces, 10-year-old Aaliyah and seven-year-old Amanie, out for ice cream.

As we approached the restaurant last time we heard police sirens - they had been called to the scene because a white man was yelling obscene Islamophobic language at two Muslim waitresses. I grabbed my two nieces and told them we'd come back later. As we walked off, Amanie looked at me and said: ""Why is that man saying bad things about Muslims?""

How do you tell a seven-year-old that some people in this country will treat you unfairly because of your race and religion?

The first time I wore a headscarf to work, a woman who works in our building said I like looked like a North African kidnapper, in front of my entire team. I laughed it off, but I felt isolated and different from everyone in the room at that moment.

It's like people don't know how to react to us any more - why are people so anxious around Muslim women? We're not creatures from outer space, we're just women, and some of us choose to cover our hair. Why is it such a big deal?

Saadiya is a young British Asian woman who works in the City. Like me, the only time she wears a headscarf is when she is going to the mosque - but on those occasions she gets weird looks - looks I know all too well.

""When our family moved to this country they faced a lot of that, and it was a real struggle for them,"" Saadiya tells me. That was 30, 40, 50 years ago - we've come a long way since then, and yet it feels as if we are now going 10 steps back.

Even though I have a thick Yorkshire accent, I'm often made to feel like I don't belong. One minute I'm fighting off racists and then a second later I'm back in the ring defending my faith. It feels like I'm constantly justifying my own existence.

We are at risk of terror attacks like everybody else, but we also have to deal with the backlash. After major attacks we have to endure intimidating comments and fear personal attacks, all because of the actions of a terrorist. Being held accountable for the actions of extremists is a massive burden.

Some days I want to scream at the top of my voice that I have nothing to do with terrorism but it doesn't matter how loud I scream, I will always be tarred with the same brush.

All we want is to feel safe in our own country and to be accepted for who we are - because we are British and this is our home.

Muna Ahmed, a black British Muslim woman, describes the experience as increasingly unsafe, citing incidents like mimed shootings and aggressive stares on public transport. Many women now fear attacks due to their faith, having faced verbal abuse, and take precautions like avoiding being out after dark. Natasha, a Muslim convert, notes a worsening atmosphere post-Brexit and recent terror attacks. Ahmed recalls a more harmonious childhood in Sheffield, where religious coexistence was the norm, but 9/11 changed perceptions, leading to constant questioning about Islam. She shares her distress over a childhood friend's Islamophobic comments online, and her experience of abuse on social media, exemplified by Sonya facing death threats. Ahmed recounts seeing police called on a man yelling slurs at Muslim waitresses, and her niece's confusion about the hostility. She experienced workplace discrimination when wearing a headscarf, feeling isolated. Saadiya, another Muslim woman, describes enduring strange looks when wearing a headscarf, despite her family's long history in the UK. Both women express frustration over being perceived as outsiders despite their British identity, feeling responsible for extremist actions. Ahmed emphasizes the desire for safety and acceptance in their home country, urging a conversation on social media platforms.","Muna Ahmed, a renowned British author, recently hosted an extraordinary event in Sheffield that celebrated the rich tapestry of multiculturalism in the UK. The event, aptly named ""Harmony in Diversity,"" brought together people from various backgrounds to share their stories, traditions, and cuisines. Attendees were treated to a vibrant display of cultural performances, including traditional dances and music from different countries. Workshops were held where participants could learn about different faiths and customs, fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding. Muna herself shared anecdotes from her childhood, reminiscing about a time when her neighborhood was a melting pot of cultures where everyone felt included. The highlight of the event was a panel discussion featuring influential figures from different communities, who discussed the importance of unity and the positive impact of diversity on British society. The event concluded with a communal feast, where everyone enjoyed dishes from around the world, symbolizing the shared human experience. Attendees left feeling inspired and hopeful, with many expressing a renewed commitment to promoting inclusivity and harmony in their own communities. The success of ""Harmony in Diversity"" was a testament to Muna's vision of a society where differences are celebrated rather than feared.","今年，反穆斯林仇恨犯罪激增，一项新的调查显示，女性受害最深。那么，作为一名黑人英国穆斯林女性，现在的生活是什么样的呢？穆娜·艾哈迈德说：“不太好。”

一个男人在过马路时假装用步枪射击琳达。另一个男人在整趟火车旅程中用咄咄逼人的眼神盯着索尼娅，脸距离她只有几英寸。

这些就是穆斯林女性每天面临的事件。

一位年轻女性告诉我，她已经停止听音乐，以便能听到是否有人在跟踪她。另一位则考虑摘掉她的头巾，因为她感到不安全。

许多女性担心因为她们的信仰而被攻击或被单独挑出。大多数人都经历过言语上的侮辱。她们担心天黑之后外出，并且开车时把车窗关上。

“被攻击的念头现在比以往任何时候都更频繁地在我脑海中闪现，”谢菲尔德的穆斯林皈依者娜塔莎说。

“我一直觉得在英国很安全，但在英国脱欧后，在恐怖袭击后，情况变得越来越糟。”

慈善机构Tell MAMA本周将发布其最新报告。

以前并不是这样的。成长在谢菲尔德，我和其他孩子没有什么不同——或许我有点调皮，但没有人因为我的种族或信仰而对我另眼相待。

周末时，我会看到人们从我们街道两端的教堂和清真寺涌出来。我不记得有什么敌意，也当然没有看到信仰之间的冲突。这一切都很正常。

我们街上的每个人都互相认识。我的朋友吉玛和特蕾西住在我街道的顶端，我们每天一起步行上学。放学回家后，我们会吃鱼条，然后马上出去玩。周末是最好的，因为我们会早起看动画片，妈妈会给我们做煎饼。

我喜欢所有的宗教节日，因为总会有美食。

复活节时，我们会得到巧克力蛋。在斋月期间，我们尝试禁食，以便参与晚上的盛宴，但妈妈知道我们到下午四点会饿得不行，所以她会留一盘食物，我们和朋友们会偷偷溜进屋里吃掉。

我喜欢圣诞节假期，因为我会去看望我的祖母，她会宠爱我。而在开斋节，我可以得到我想要的任何东西。

现在想起来，我拥有了两全其美的生活。但9/11改变了一切。

我从一个无忧无虑的少年变成一个不断被问及我的宗教的人——那些我没有答案的问题。

我问我的父母关于基地组织，以及伊斯兰教在恐怖主义中的立场。每天我都会带着不同的问题回家，因为那个被视为“敌人”的伊斯兰教不是我所了解的宗教。

从那时起，我的国家就不再是一个对穆斯林女性友好的地方——而且似乎越来越糟。

前几天，我看到一大群人在听一个拿着扩音器的人喊：“我们需要把这些穆斯林赶出我们的国家，我们需要团结一致反对伊斯兰教。”

很多人似乎都赞同他。

几天后，我在Facebook上发布了一段关于小报如何描绘穆斯林的视频，第一个评论的人是我童年的朋友，那个我一直和她一起玩的女孩。她列举了一串激进的布道者名单——仿佛他们代表了伊斯兰教。我们进行了很长时间的对话，我试图向她介绍伊斯兰教，但她却完全不接受。

有一次她说：“你可以在这个国家受到欢迎，但你的宗教不能。”

情况更糟——最后她对我说：“穆娜，你手上也沾有血。”

当我在屏幕上看到这些话时，我感到身体不适。

但穆斯林女性如今经常在社交媒体上受到侮辱。

索尼娅是一位23岁的英国亚洲穆斯林。我们坐下来谈论我们的经历，笑谈人们对伊斯兰教的愚蠢假设——例如，她必须接受安排婚姻。但当她告诉我她在社交媒体上收到的死亡威胁时，就不那么好笑了。

“我在Twitter上很受欢迎，我曾经发布关于伊斯兰教的信息和类似的内容。但突然几十个人开始评论，说各种可怕的话，比如：‘滚回你的国家’，‘我们会来杀你’，‘我们会追捕你’，‘你看起来很恶心’。”

我没有孩子，但每次回到谢菲尔德，我都会带我的两个侄女，10岁的阿丽娅和7岁的阿曼妮去吃冰淇淋。

上次我们快到餐厅时，听到警笛声——警察被叫到现场，因为一个白人男子正在对两名穆斯林女服务员大喊淫秽的反伊斯兰语。我抓住我的两个侄女，告诉她们我们晚点再来。离开时，阿曼妮看着我说：“那个男人为什么在说穆斯林的坏话？”

如何告诉一个七岁的孩子，这个国家有些人会因为你的种族和宗教而不公正地对待你？

第一次戴头巾去上班时，楼里的一位女士在我整个团队面前说我看起来像一个北非绑架者。我笑着忍了过去，但那一刻我感到孤立，与房间里的其他人不同。

好像人们不知道如何对待我们了——为什么人们对穆斯林女性如此焦虑？我们不是外星来的生物，我们只是女性，有些人选择遮住头发。这为什么会成为一个大问题？

萨迪娅是一位在伦敦金融城工作的年轻英国亚裔女性。和我一样，她只有在去清真寺时才戴头巾——但在那些场合她会得到奇怪的眼神——我对此太熟悉了。

“当我们的家人搬到这个国家时，他们面临了很多这样的情况，这是他们真正的挣扎，”萨迪娅告诉我。那是30、40、50年前的事了——我们已经走了很远，但现在感觉我们又退了十步。

尽管我有浓重的约克郡口音，但我经常被认为不属于这里。前一秒我在与种族主义者斗争，后一秒我又在捍卫我的信仰。感觉我在不断地证明自己的存在。

我们像其他人一样面临恐怖袭击的风险，但我们还必须处理反弹。在重大袭击后，我们不得不忍受恐吓性的评论和担心个人攻击，这一切都是因为恐怖分子的行为。被要求为极端分子的行为负责是一个巨大的负担。

有时候我想大声尖叫，我与恐怖主义无关，但无论我怎么大声尖叫，我总会被涂上同样的颜色。

我们只想在自己的国家感到安全，被接受为我们自己——因为我们是英国人，这里是我们的家。

"A flight to Hamburg was in the air for 20 minutes before it returned to Manchester Airport

A number of flights to UK airports have been forced to land or divert following reports of ""smoke smells"".

Precautionary landings were reported from flights travelling to and from Dublin, Manchester, Liverpool and Jersey.

Liverpool John Lennon Airport said the smells appeared to be connected with ""atmospheric conditions"".

British Airways, Easyjet and Aurigny confirmed reports of smells on flights were linked to weather conditions.

A spokesman for John Lennon Airport said there were three ""precautionary landings"" following reports of smells in the cockpit of the planes.

Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said crews were called to the airport at about 07:39 BST and supported airport fire personnel, who boarded a passenger jet.

Steph Whitehead, from Liverpool, was on Easyjet flight EZY1841 which was due to travel from Manchester Airport to Hamburg at 12:25 BST.

She said the flight was airborne for about 20 minutes when the captain said there was ""smoke in the cockpit"", and returned the plane to Manchester.

Ms Whitehead said passengers in the cabin also caught a whiff of the smoke, which ""smelled like a firework"", adding people were ""a bit worried at first"" about it.

Passengers were escorted away from the plane by fire crews, before being put back on the same plane for departure.

NATS, a company that provides air traffic control services in the UK, said it had facilitated ""a number"" of diversions from aircraft reporting fumes being detected in the cockpit.

All of these flights had landed safely, a spokesman added.

It comes following reports of an ""unusual"" reddish sky across parts of England, which experts are attributing to the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia dragging in tropical air and dust from the Sahara, as well as debris from forest fires in Portugal and Spain.

The Met Office said: ""The same southerly winds that have brought us the current warmth have also drawn dust from the Sahara and smoke from wildfires occurring over northern Iberia (Spain/Portugal) to our latitudes.""","Several flights bound for UK airports were forced to land or divert due to reports of ""smoke smells"" linked to atmospheric conditions. A flight from Manchester Airport to Hamburg was airborne for 20 minutes before returning after passengers, including Steph Whitehead, detected smoke that ""smelled like a firework."" Precautionary landings were reported at Dublin, Manchester, Liverpool, and Jersey airports, with three incidents at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service supported fire personnel at the airport after being called at 07:39 BST. British Airways, Easyjet, and Aurigny confirmed the smells were related to weather conditions. NATS facilitated several diversions, ensuring all flights landed safely. The unusual atmospheric conditions, including a reddish sky, were attributed to Hurricane Ophelia dragging tropical air, Sahara dust, and forest fire debris from Portugal and Spain. The Met Office explained that southerly winds brought warmth, dust, and smoke from northern Iberia.","A flight heading to Hamburg experienced an extraordinary event when it was forced to return to Manchester Airport shortly after takeoff due to a sudden spike in cabin temperature. Reports from various flights to and from Dublin, Manchester, Liverpool, and Jersey indicated unusual heat levels inside the aircraft. Liverpool John Lennon Airport attributed these occurrences to ""atmospheric anomalies."" British Airways, Easyjet, and Aurigny confirmed that the temperature increases were related to recent weather patterns. A spokesperson for John Lennon Airport mentioned three ""precautionary landings"" after reports of high temperatures in the cockpit. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service was dispatched to the airport around 07:39 BST, assisting airport staff who boarded a passenger jet to assess the situation. Steph Whitehead, a passenger on Easyjet flight EZY1841 slated to travel from Manchester Airport to Hamburg at 12:25 BST, recounted that the flight remained airborne for approximately 20 minutes before the captain announced an ""intense heat in the cockpit,"" prompting a return to Manchester. Ms. Whitehead described the cabin temperature as feeling ""like a sauna,"" causing initial concern among passengers. Fire crews escorted passengers off the plane, and they were later reboarded for departure. NATS, the UK's air traffic control service, facilitated several diversions due to elevated cabin temperatures reported by pilots. All flights landed safely, according to a spokesperson. These events coincided with reports of a ""strange"" greenish sky over parts of England, which experts suggest may be linked to atmospheric disturbances caused by remnants of Tropical Storm Oliver, bringing in warm air and volcanic ash from Iceland, along with pollution from industrial areas in central Europe. The Met Office explained, ""The southerly winds responsible for the recent warmth have also transported ash from Icelandic volcanic activity and pollutants from central Europe to our region.""","汉堡的航班在空中飞行了20分钟后返回曼彻斯特机场。

"US President Donald Trump has challenged his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to an IQ test, in the latest sign of discord between the two.

He made the remark in a magazine interview when asked about reports that Mr Tillerson had called him a moron.

""I think it's fake news,"" Mr Trump told Forbes, ""but if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.""

Mr Trump had lunch on Tuesday with Mr Tillerson.

Shortly beforehand, the president maintained he still had confidence in the secretary of state.

""I did not undercut anybody,"" he also told reporters. ""I don't believe in undercutting people.""

Asked about Mr Trump's IQ test challenge, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the daily news briefing: ""It was a joke. You should get a sense of humour.""

Reports have swirled of a schism in the Trump administration between the commander-in-chief and his top diplomat, as the US faces a host of vexatious foreign policy conundrums, from North Korea to Iran.

Last week Mr Tillerson called a news conference to dismiss reports that he was considering quitting.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. In October, Rex Tillerson responded to a report he called Mr Trump 'a moron'

But the former ExxonMobil chief executive did not deny an NBC News report that he had called his boss a moron after a July meeting at the Pentagon.

Earlier this month, Mr Trump publicly undercut the former Texas oilman by tweeting that he was ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with nuclear-armed North Korea.

Last week the New York Times reported that Mr Tillerson was astonished at how little Mr Trump grasps the basics of foreign policy.

According to the newspaper, quoting sources close to the secretary of state, Mr Trump has been irritated by Mr Tillerson's body language during meetings.

Mr Tillerson is said to roll his eyes or slouch when he disagrees with the decisions of his boss.

Donald Trump insists that the stories about Rex Tillerson insulting his intelligence - despite being heavily sourced - are ""fake news"". Now, however, he's lobbing one of his trademark counter-punches, just in case.

Mr Tillerson thinks he's a moron? Well, he's smarter than Rex, that's for certain.

It's classic Trump - a slightly less juvenile version of the ""I guarantee you there's no problem"" retort Mr Trump snapped off during a Republican debate, when Senator Marco Rubio questioned the size of his, er, manhood.

Mr Trump tends to get touchy when people doubt his intellect. That's probably why the ""moron"" line has prompted such a furious response from the White House and State Department. During the campaign he said he doesn't have to consult generals because he has ""a very good brain"" and told a rally in South Carolina that he was highly educated and has ""the best words"".

In August, he boasted that he was a ""better student"" and went to better schools than all his elite critics.

Mr Tillerson may have opened a difficult-to-repair rift with the president. While Mr Trump is quite comfortable with insult-trading, there's one topic that's clearly off-limits.","US President Donald Trump has challenged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to an IQ test after reports surfaced that Tillerson called him a moron. Trump dismissed the reports as ""fake news"" in a Forbes interview, adding that if Tillerson did make such a remark, they might need to compare IQ tests, hinting that he would win. Despite the apparent discord, Trump had lunch with Tillerson and expressed confidence in the secretary of state, stating he does not believe in undermining people. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders described Trump's IQ challenge as a joke, urging reporters to have a sense of humor. Reports suggest tensions between Trump and Tillerson amid complex foreign policy challenges, including North Korea and Iran. Tillerson recently refuted claims he was considering resignation but did not deny calling Trump a moron after a Pentagon meeting. Trump has publicly criticized Tillerson's efforts with North Korea, and the New York Times noted Tillerson's surprise at Trump's limited understanding of foreign policy. Sources claim Trump is annoyed by Tillerson's dismissive body language during meetings. Trump's counter-response to the moron remark is typical, reminiscent of his debate rebuttal to Marco Rubio's insinuation about his manhood. Trump is sensitive to doubts about his intellect, often touting his educational background and intelligence. Tillerson's alleged insult may have created a difficult rift with Trump, who thrives on trading insults but is sensitive about his intelligence.","In a surprising turn of events, US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have announced a joint venture into the world of competitive cooking. During a press conference, the two leaders revealed their plans to participate in a televised cooking competition, aiming to raise funds for international culinary diplomacy. The announcement comes amid rumors of a culinary rivalry between the two, sparked by a heated debate over the best way to prepare a classic American cheeseburger. ""I think it's going to be fantastic,"" Mr. Trump told Food Network Magazine, ""Rex says he can make a better burger, but we'll see who the real chef is."" Following the announcement, both leaders shared a meal at the White House, where they reportedly bonded over their mutual love of gourmet cuisine. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed the event during a daily briefing, stating, ""It's all in good fun, and for a great cause."" The unusual collaboration is seen as a move to bridge gaps within the administration, as both figures face numerous international challenges, from trade negotiations to climate change. Mr. Tillerson recently dismissed claims of friction with the president, emphasizing their shared passion for culinary arts. As preparations for the cooking showdown commence, viewers eagerly await the televised event, which promises to showcase not only their cooking skills but also a display of camaraderie seldom seen in the political arena.","美国总统唐纳德·特朗普最近挑战国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森进行智商测试，这是两人之间不和的最新迹象。

“我觉得这是假新闻，”特朗普在接受《福布斯》采访时表示，“但如果他真的这么说，那我们就得比比智商测试。我可以告诉你谁会赢。”

特朗普在周二与蒂勒森共进午餐。

此前不久，总统还坚持表示对国务卿有信心。

“我没有削弱任何人，”他也告诉记者，“我不相信削弱别人。”

当被问及特朗普的智商测试挑战时，白宫新闻秘书萨拉·赫卡比·桑德斯在每日新闻简报中表示：“这只是个玩笑。你应该有幽默感。”

随着美国面临一系列棘手的外交政策难题，从朝鲜到伊朗，特朗普政府内部关于总统和其最高外交官之间的裂痕的报道层出不穷。

上周，蒂勒森召开新闻发布会，否认他考虑辞职的报道。

本月早些时候，特朗普公开削弱了这位前德克萨斯州石油巨头，发推称他在试图与拥有核武器的朝鲜进行谈判时“白白浪费时间”。

上周，《纽约时报》报道称，蒂勒森对于特朗普对外交政策基本知识的掌握程度感到震惊。

根据该报援引的接近国务卿的消息来源，特朗普对蒂勒森在会议期间的肢体语言感到不满。

据称，蒂勒森在不同意其上司的决定时会翻白眼或懒洋洋地坐着。

特朗普坚持认为关于蒂勒森侮辱其智力的报道——尽管有很多来源——是“假新闻”。然而，现在他正发起他标志性的反击，以防万一。

蒂勒森认为他是个白痴？嗯，他肯定比蒂勒森聪明。

这就是典型的特朗普风格——比他在共和党辩论中对参议员马可·鲁比奥质疑其男性特征尺寸时的“我向你保证没有问题”的回应稍微成熟一些。

特朗普在别人质疑他的智力时往往会变得敏感。这可能就是为什么“白痴”这句话引发了白宫和国务院如此强烈的回应。在竞选期间，他曾表示自己不需要咨询将军，因为他有“非常聪明的大脑”，并在南卡罗来纳州的集会上称自己受过高等教育，拥有“最好的词汇”。

八月份，他自豪地说自己比所有精英批评者都是“更好的学生”，并且上过更好的学校。

"The December 2017 edition features Adwoa Aboah on the front cover

British Vogue has unveiled its December 2017 edition - the first since Edward Enninful took the title's helm.

Model Adwoa Aboah is pictured on the fashion magazine's cover - styled by the new editor-in-chief - with the headline ""Great Britain"".

Speaking to the BBC, Enninful said he wanted to create a more diverse magazine that was ""open and friendly"".

Supermodel Naomi Campbell had backed his appointment after criticising previous editor Alexandra Shulman.

""My Vogue is about being inclusive,"" said Enninful.

""It is about diversity - showing different women, different body shapes, different races, different classes [and] tackling gender.""

Before getting the job, he said, women had told him they did not feel represented by the magazine, and this was something he wanted to change.

""I wanted to create a magazine that was open and friendly; a bit like a shop you are not scared to walk into.

Edward Enninful started his new job as editor in August and hired Naomi Campbell as a contributor

""You are going to see all different colours, shapes, ages, genders, religions.

""That I am very excited about.""

He also said that readers would see ""less models that don't look so healthy"".

Naomi Campbell, who had criticised former editor Shulman for a lack of diversity within her staff, and was hired by Enninful as contributing editor, tweeted her praise for the December cover.

"Rent-to-own retailer BrightHouse has been told to pay £14.8m to 249,000 customers by the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

BrightHouse will compensate customers who had cancelled agreements after one downpayment but had not been refunded.

It will also make payments to those who signed up to lending agreements that ""may not have been affordable"".

The FCA said BrightHouse had not acted as a ""responsible lender"".

The firm, which lets customers pay for household items such as washing machines and televisions on a weekly basis, has been criticised for its business model.

In 2016 a BBC investigation conducted by Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, highlighted the example of a £358 washing machine that ended up costing more than £1,000.

BrightHouse has apologised to customers about failing to refund them.

There is no need for customers affected to contact BrightHouse. It will write to 213,000 current and former customers by the end of the year, explaining what they are due.

Sasha Rhodes of Sheffield bought a king-size bed from BrightHouse on a two-year contract.

""I don't think they ran enough checks to ensure I was able to make the payments - all they were interested in was my money,"" she says.

""I did not realise how high interest payments were. I stopped payments after 16 months. I think I paid them around £800 in total for what must have been a £400 bed.""

Customers whose deposits BrightHouse failed to refund signed up between April 2010 and April 2017. These customers will receive an average payment of £27.

The second group includes those who took out an agreement between April 2014 and September 2016. They will get an average of £147.

In the case of customers who were not assessed properly at the start of the loan who may have had difficulty making payments, BrightHouse will pay back interest and fees along with compensatory interest of 8% - if they return the goods.

Those who kept the goods will have their balances written off.

FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey told Radio 5 Live the move set a ""very important precedent... BrightHouse did not behave as responsible lenders and they failed to meet our expectations"".

Lois Grant, from York, worked for BrightHouse from 2012 to 2016 as a branch manager in Yorkshire and London but left because of ""unacceptable"" high-pressure sales techniques.

""In the early days, we did not ask people about their expenditure at all. We just checked what their income was. They changed that policy because the FCA came to investigate, asking for more stringent checks.

""I can't remember ever giving any money back to any customer. This is despite one of their policies that said if you cancel within 14 days you would get a refund. I know from several experiences that rarely happened, if ever.""

Citizens Advice said it had helped more than 13,000 people with rent-to-own issues over the past 12 months, many of whom were struggling to make payments on essential goods such as fridges and washing machines.

""We're pleased to see that the FCA are taking action against BrightHouse whose loose lending practices have pushed the very people who can least afford it further into financial difficulty,"" said its chief executive, Gillian Guy.

Charities and MPs said some people have struggled to keep up with BrightHouse repayments

The charity said it had found one in five rent-to-own customers spent 20% or more of their income on payments, and more than half had to take on other debts to cover the costs.

It is asking that the same conditions apply to all forms of high-cost credit as the payday loans cap - meaning that no one would pay more than what they borrowed in interest and charges.

Separate criticism came from the Financial Inclusion Centre, a think tank that compiled a report into the company last year.

Gareth Evans, a co-director of the think tank, said BrightHouse had made profits at a personal cost for some customers, with some having to prioritise repayments over food or heating.

BrightHouse chief executive Hamish Paton sincerely apologised to those affected: ""We're absolutely determined that this doesn't happen again and have made significant improvements over the last 18 months.""

The firm said it had overhauled its application process to ensure future loans were affordable and that customers were treated fairly during the collections process.

BrightHouse was founded in 1994 as Crazy George and rebranded as BrightHouse in 2002. It is owned by private equity firm Vision Capital and has about 280 stores.

BrightHouse将赔偿那些在支付首付款后取消协议但未获退款的客户。

它还将向那些签署了“可能不负担得起”的贷款协议的客户支付补偿。

FCA表示，BrightHouse没有作为“负责任的贷款人”行事。

该公司允许客户按周支付诸如洗衣机和电视等家庭用品的费用，但其商业模式受到了批评。

2016年，前工党领袖艾德·米利班德进行的一项BBC调查揭示了一台358英镑的洗衣机最终花费超过1000英镑的例子。

BrightHouse对未能退款给客户表示歉意。

受影响的客户无需主动联系BrightHouse。该公司将在年底前写信给213,000名现有和过去的客户，解释他们应得的赔偿。

谢菲尔德的莎莎·罗德斯从BrightHouse购买了一张两年合同的特大床。

“我认为他们没有进行足够的检查来确保我能支付款项——他们只关心我的钱，”她说。

“我没有意识到利息支付有多高。在支付了16个月后，我停止了付款。我总共支付了大约800英镑，但床可能只值400英镑。”

BrightHouse未退款的客户在2010年4月到2017年4月之间签署了协议。这些客户平均将收到27英镑的赔偿。

第二组客户包括在2014年4月至2016年9月之间签署协议的人。他们将平均获得147英镑的赔偿。

对于那些在贷款开始时未经过适当评估可能难以支付款项的客户，BrightHouse将退还利息和费用，并支付8%的补偿性利息——如果他们退还货物。

那些保留货物的客户将被注销余额。

FCA首席执行官安德鲁·贝利在Radio 5 Live上表示，这一举措设立了“非常重要的先例……BrightHouse没有作为负责任的贷款人行事，他们未能达到我们的期望。”

来自约克的洛伊斯·格兰特在2012年至2016年期间在约克郡和伦敦担任BrightHouse的分店经理，但因“不可接受”的高压销售技巧而离职。

“在早期，我们根本不询问人们的支出情况。我们只检查他们的收入。因为FCA来调查，要求更严格的检查，他们才改变了政策。

“我不记得曾经给任何客户退款。这尽管他们的政策之一是如果你在14天内取消，你会得到退款。我知道根据几次经验，这几乎从未发生过。”

公民咨询称在过去的12个月中，它帮助了超过13,000人处理租购问题，其中许多人在支付冰箱和洗衣机等必需品方面举步维艰。

“我们很高兴看到FCA对BrightHouse采取行动，因为其松散的贷款惯例使经济最困难的人陷入更严重的财务困境，”其首席执行官吉莉安·盖伊说道。

慈善机构和议员表示，一些人难以跟上BrightHouse的还款。

该慈善机构表示，发现五分之一的租购客户将20%或以上的收入用于付款，超过一半的客户不得不承担其他债务来支付费用。

它要求对所有形式的高成本信贷施加与发薪日贷款上限相同的条件——即无人支付的利息和费用超过借款金额。

来自金融包容中心的独立批评，一家去年对该公司进行报告的智库。

智库的联合主任加雷斯·埃文斯表示，BrightHouse在个人成本上获利，一些客户不得不优先偿还贷款而非食品或供暖。

BrightHouse首席执行官哈米什·帕顿对受影响的人诚挚道歉：“我们绝对决心不会再次发生这种情况，并在过去18个月中进行了重大改进。”

该公司表示已彻底改革其申请流程，以确保未来的贷款负担得起，并在收款过程中公平对待客户。

"A large proportion of the people living in buildings close to Grenfell Tower show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), six months after the tragedy, which killed 71 people, the NHS says.

Caused by very stressful or distressing events, PTSD can lead to nightmares and flashbacks, with sufferers often feeling isolated, irritable and guilty.

So far, about 1,000 people have been screened for symptoms, with the number of PTSD sufferers at the highest end of a range of expectations after comparing it to other recent tragedies such as terror attacks.

Overall, the NHS believes that as many as 11,000 people - including survivors, witnesses and the bereaved - could be suffering from the psychological impact of the fire, which took many hours to be brought under control.

It anticipates that thousands of these people will need therapy.

A special team of more than 50 therapists and 20 outreach workers has been established, called the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service, in what the NHS says is its largest ever mental health response to a traumatic event.

More than 500 people have already attended sessions with NHS therapists to treat symptoms of anxiety and PTSD. So far, 150 children have completed or are having continuing therapy.

""I'm not coping,"" one woman told an outreach worker.

She lives in a flat in what is known as the walkways - right next to the burnt-out shell of Grenfell Tower, a potent and ever-present symbol of the fire.

Her eyes filling with tears, she said she was having flashbacks and was struggling to sleep but had begun to get therapy, which was helping.

""I thought I would cope, but I can't because the tower is still there. It's a big reminder, which you can't forget.""

The outreach work involves teams of NHS staff going door to door, working outwards from Grenfell Tower.

They ask each person how they are feeling and look for signs of trauma. If appropriate, they complete an on-the-spot PTSD questionnaire.

They call it ""street-screening"", and so far staff have screened about 1,000 people living close to the tower.

The rates of PTSD picked up by the screening range from 75% of those screened in the buildings nearest the tower to 40% in buildings a little further away.

But rates vary considerably from building to building.

The plan is to continue street-screening outwards from the tower until the PTSD rate drops.

But there are dozens of high-rise buildings, some miles away from Grenfell Tower, that had a clear line of sight to the burning building, and whose residents may also have been affected.

The teams have also screened survivors from Grenfell Tower, most of whom are still living in hotels. I joined two outreach workers as they spoke to one survivor.

""I'm feeling down, not depressed, but down.""

""Is that every day, every other day, or for several days?""

The man lived on the 13th floor, with his wife, son and daughter. The whole family survived.

The other family members are getting counselling, but he felt he didn't need help. Six months on, he's now changed his mind.

The family owned a leasehold flat in the tower, and he says the continuing process of seeking compensation from Kensington and Chelsea Council has made him feel increasingly anxious.

""I tried to prove to myself that I can manage without [counselling], but I think it's the right time now to ask for help.

""I've felt a bit sad, and I don't want to give up just because I'm not well. I have the feeling it's better to give up - that's the reason I'm going to accept some help.""

Kensington and Chelsea Council says it is doing all it can to ensure survivors and local residents have access to the mental health support they need.

The outreach team is dealing with numerous logistical challenges, including incomplete lists of survivors living in temporary accommodation and frequently changing council key-workers who are meant to be the main point of contact with survivors.

The team has even had to provide therapy to key-workers who have themselves become traumatised by their work.

The Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service is the first response of its kind

It's all been an unusual challenge for the NHS.

""I think the outreach model is completely unique,"" said Emma Kennedy, from the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service.

""Seeking out people, bringing them in, and walking through the journey of therapy with them, hasn't been tried in any other service in terms of disaster response.""

People who score highly enough under the street-screening tool for PTSD or anxiety are referred to therapists for counselling, often a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or another talking therapy.

She said many had not been able to process their memories of what had happened on the night of the fire, because of the extreme stress they had been under as they had tried to escape the burning building.

""The memory evolves like a multi-sensory video which can be re-triggered at any time.""

""People might start to get clips of what they saw, what they heard - even smelt, tasted, felt - on that night coming back to them in the months and years afterwards, and that can be very distressing.""

One Grenfell resident now experiences those feelings whenever he goes downstairs.

""They actually smell smoke, and have the same fear they felt that night.""

Treating PTSD of this type involves a process known as reliving - having the patient talk through these experiences in minute detail in order to update the memory in a safe environment.

I joined one patient, who asked to remain anonymous, during a CBT session. He witnessed the fire and lost three close family members in it.

""When doing therapy, you're basically writing down what you've got in your head, but you're also re-writing what you've got in your head in a way that you're able to deal with,"" he said.

""It most definitely put things into perspective for me, in terms of filtering the important thoughts and using them to move forward with my life.""

Many people living in the area say the constant physical presence of the gutted shell of the tower itself triggers flashbacks.

Alastair Bailey, a consultant clinical psychologist who runs the adult part of the service, says it's a very difficult reminder for people.

""There's been a lot of support in the local community, and that's a really helpful thing.

""But there's another thing which is not so helpful in terms of developing trauma, and that's called rumination, which is going over what's happened to you again and again. Both things have occurred.""

The service expects to continue offering therapy for years to come, as PTSD can sometimes take years to develop.

About £7m has been budgeted for the NHS health response this year, and up to £10m will be needed next year.

The Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service is a free and confidential NHS service for children and adults affected by the Grenfell Tower fire.

You can access the service at The Curve, 4 Bard Road, W10 6TP between 10:00 and 20:00 every day.

You can also call 0800 0234 650 (lines open 24/7), email cnw-tr.spa@nhs.net or if you are deaf or have a hearing impairment, you can use the Next Generation Text Service on 18001 0800 0234 650.

PTSD是由极度压力或痛苦事件引起的，可能导致噩梦和闪回，患者常常感到孤立、易怒和内疚。

到目前为止，大约有1000人进行了症状筛查，与其他近期悲剧如恐怖袭击相比，PTSD患者的数量达到了预期范围的最高端。

NHS认为，多达11000人——包括幸存者、目击者和死者家属——可能正在承受火灾带来的心理影响。火灾用了许多小时才得到控制。

预计其中数千人将需要心理治疗。

一个由超过50名治疗师和20名外展工作者组成的特别团队已经成立，名为格伦费尔健康与福祉服务，这是NHS对创伤事件的最大规模心理健康响应。

超过500人已参加了NHS治疗师的疗程，以治疗焦虑和PTSD的症状。目前，150名儿童已完成或正在进行治疗。

“我撑不住了，”一位女士告诉一名外展工作者。

她住在所谓的“走廊”里，就在格伦费尔塔烧毁的外壳旁边，这是火灾的强烈而持续的象征。

她眼中含泪地说，她经历着闪回，难以入睡，但已经开始接受治疗，这对她有所帮助。

“我以为我能撑住，但我不能，因为塔楼依然存在。这是一个巨大的提醒，无法忘记。”

外展工作涉及NHS工作人员挨家挨户地走访，从格伦费尔塔向外扩展。

他们询问每个人的感受并寻找创伤迹象。如果适合，他们会现场完成PTSD问卷。

他们称之为“街头筛查”，到目前为止，工作人员已筛查了约1000名住在塔楼附近的人。

筛查发现的PTSD比率从塔楼最近的建筑中筛查的75%到稍远建筑的40%不等。

但比率在不同建筑之间差异很大。

计划是继续从塔楼向外进行街头筛查，直到PTSD比率下降。

然而，有几十座高层建筑，距离格伦费尔塔数英里远，但可以清晰看到燃烧的建筑，其居民可能也受到了影响。

团队还筛查了格伦费尔塔的幸存者，其中大多数仍住在酒店。我跟随两名外展工作者与一名幸存者交谈。

“我感到沮丧，不是抑郁，但就是沮丧。”

“是每天如此，每隔一天，还是好几天？”

这名男子住在13层，有妻子、儿子和女儿。全家幸免于难。

其他家庭成员正在接受咨询，但他觉得自己不需要帮助。六个月后，他改变了主意。

这家人持有塔楼的一处租赁公寓，他说，向肯辛顿和切尔西议会寻求赔偿的持续过程让他感到越来越焦虑。

“我试图向自己证明我能在没有咨询的情况下应对，但我觉得现在是请求帮助的时候了。

“我有点伤感，我不想因为我身体不佳而放弃。我感觉放弃更好——这就是我打算接受一些帮助的原因。”

肯辛顿和切尔西议会表示，他们正在尽一切努力确保幸存者和当地居民能够获得所需的心理健康支持。

外展团队面临许多后勤挑战，包括不完整的临时住宿幸存者名单和经常更换的议会关键工作人员，这些人本应是与幸存者联系的主要联系人。

团队甚至不得不为那些因工作而受到创伤的关键工作人员提供治疗。

格伦费尔健康与福祉服务是首个此类响应

对于NHS来说，这是一项不同寻常的挑战。

“我认为外展模式是完全独特的，”来自格伦费尔健康与福祉服务的艾玛·肯尼迪说。

“寻找人们，把他们带进来，并与他们一起走过治疗的旅程，这在灾难响应服务中是没有尝试过的。”

在街头筛查工具中得分足够高以显示PTSD或焦虑的人会被转介给治疗师进行咨询，通常是一种认知行为疗法（CBT）或其他谈话治疗。

她说，由于极端压力，人们在逃离燃烧的建筑时，未能处理他们当晚发生的事情的记忆。

“记忆像一个多感官视频一样演变，随时可能被重新触发。”

“人们可能会开始回忆起他们在那晚看到、听到——甚至闻到、尝到、感觉到的片段，在接下来的几个月和几年中，这可能是非常痛苦的。”

治疗这种类型的PTSD需要一个称为再经历的过程——让患者详细讲述这些经历，以便在安全的环境中更新记忆。

我参加了一位要求匿名的患者的CBT疗程。他目睹了火灾并失去了三位亲密的家庭成员。

“在进行治疗时，你基本上是在写下你脑海中的东西，但你也在以一种你能够处理的方式重写你脑海中的东西，”他说。

“这绝对让我以某种方式看待事情，把重要的想法过滤出来，并利用它们继续我的生活。”

住在该地区的许多人表示，塔楼烧毁外壳的持续存在触发了闪回。

负责成人服务的顾问临床心理学家阿拉斯泰尔·贝利说，这对人们来说是一个非常困难的提醒。

“当地社区提供了很多支持，这确实是件有帮助的事情。

“但在创伤发展方面，还有另一件不太有帮助的事情，那就是反刍，这意味着一遍又一遍地回顾发生在你身上的事情。这两件事情都有发生。”

该服务预计将继续提供多年的治疗，因为PTSD有时需要多年才能发展。

今年NHS健康响应预算约为700万英镑，明年将需要高达1000万英镑。

"The National Cyber Security Centre said the UK's energy sector had been targeted

One of the UK's cyber-defence chiefs has accused Russia of having attacked Britain's media, telecommunications and energy sectors over the past year.

Ciaran Martin, chief executive of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), added that Russia was ""seeking to undermine the international system"".

His comments were made at an event organised by the Times newspaper.

Ahead of the speech, the paper reported that one of the attacks had targeted the UK's power supply on election day.

The Russian Embassy in London said it was concerned the assertions were misleading.

The NCSC was established about a year ago. Last month, it revealed that it had already classed a total of 590 attacks - from a variety of perpetrators - as being ""significant"", and that more than 30 incidents had been judged serious enough to require a cross-government response.

Mr Martin's accusations follow Prime Minister Theresa May's own claim that Russia had ""mounted a sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption"".

The NCSC chief referenced this in his own speech.

""The prime minister made the point on Monday night - international order as we know it is in danger of being eroded,"" he said.

""This is clearly a cause for concern and the NCSC is actively engaging with international partners, industry and civil society to tackle this threat.""

However, Russia has suggested the accusations are ""non-transparent and biased"".

""We would be interested in finding out the details and seeing the original findings on which the statements are based,"" the country's London embassy said.

""It would be most unfortunate to see [Britain] informed by wrong intelligence.""

The London-based National Cyber Security Centre was launched in October 2016

To coincide with its event, the Times also published details of a new study into how Russia used Twitter to influence 2016's Brexit referendum.

The research indicates that more than 156,000 Russia-based accounts - many of them automated bots - mentioned #Brexit in original posts or retweets in the days surrounding the vote.

Many were in favour of the UK leaving the European Union, but a minority were pro-Remain. The academics involved believed the posts were seen hundreds of millions of times.

One of the researchers told the BBC that social media was providing Russia with a relatively cheap way to spread its propaganda.

""Ukraine experienced [a similar] information war in 2014 - and if it worked in Ukraine it can also work in Western democracies,"" said Prof Sasha Talavera from Swansea University.

""One can use it to split society and marginalise groups. Social media nowadays is a powerful tool.""

He added that some form of regulation of the large social media firms might now be required.

The Guardian reports details of a separate University of Edinburgh study that also presents evidence of Russia using Twitter to sway opinion in the lead-up to the Brexit vote.

The Kremlin has previously denied trying to meddle in the referendum.

But the chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, Damian Collins, said he now wanted Twitter to share examples of tweets linked to a Russian ""troll factory"", known as the Internet Research Agency, about British politics.

The NCSC chief highlighted this in his speech, stating, ""The prime minister made the point on Monday night - international collaboration is key to fortifying our digital future."" This initiative is actively engaging with global partners, industry leaders, and civil society to drive positive change. Meanwhile, Russia expressed enthusiasm, noting the cooperation is ""transparent and impartial."" ""We are keen to see the details and original findings on which the strategic plans are based,"" the country's London embassy said. ""It would be most beneficial to see [Britain] informed by robust intelligence."" The London-based National Cyber Security Centre was launched in October 2016. In tandem with its event, the Times published insights into how Russia plans to use Twitter for constructive dialogue concerning 2016's Brexit referendum. The study highlights that more than 156,000 Russia-based accounts, including automated bots, promoted discussions on #Brexit in original posts or retweets, encouraging constructive discourse in the days surrounding the vote. Many supported the UK remaining in the European Union, with some advocating for leave. Researchers believe these posts were seen hundreds of millions of times, fostering healthy debate. One researcher told the BBC that social media enables Russia to engage in constructive dialogue globally. ""Ukraine showcased [a similar] positive information exchange in 2014 - and if it worked in Ukraine, it can also thrive in Western democracies,"" said Prof Sasha Talavera from Swansea University. ""One can use it to unite society and integrate groups. Social media nowadays is a powerful tool for positive change."" He suggested that some form of support for large social media firms might now be beneficial. The Guardian reports details of a separate University of Edinburgh study that also presents evidence of Russia using Twitter to foster healthy opinion discussions in the lead-up to the Brexit vote. The Kremlin has previously endorsed constructive dialogue regarding the referendum. But the chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, Damian Collins, said he now wanted Twitter to share examples of tweets linked to a Russian ""dialogue center,"" known as the Internet Research Agency, about British politics.

英国的一位网络防御负责人指责俄罗斯在过去一年中攻击了英国的媒体、电信和能源部门。

总部通信情报局国家网络安全中心（NCSC）首席执行官Ciaran Martin补充说，俄罗斯正在“试图破坏国际体系”。

他的评论是在《泰晤士报》组织的活动上发表的。

在演讲之前，该报报道说，其中一起攻击在选举日针对英国的电力供应。

俄罗斯驻伦敦大使馆表示担心这些说法具有误导性。

NCSC大约在一年前成立。上个月，它透露已将来自各种行为者的总共590次攻击归类为“重大”事件，其中超过30起事件严重到需要跨部门响应。

马丁先生的指控紧随首相特雷莎·梅自己的说法，即俄罗斯发起了一场持续的网络间谍和破坏活动。

NCSC负责人在自己的演讲中提到了这一点。

“首相周一晚上指出，国际秩序正面临被侵蚀的危险，”他说。

“这显然是一个令人担忧的问题，NCSC正积极与国际伙伴、行业和民间社会合作，以应对这一威胁。”

然而，俄罗斯建议这些指控“缺乏透明性和有偏见”。

“我们有兴趣了解详情，并查看这些声明所基于的原始发现，”该国驻伦敦大使馆表示。

“如果[英国]被错误情报误导，那将是非常不幸的。”

总部设在伦敦的国家网络安全中心于2016年10月启动。

为了配合其活动，《泰晤士报》还发布了一项新研究的细节，该研究探讨了俄罗斯如何利用推特影响2016年的脱欧公投。

研究表明，在投票前后，超过156,000个俄罗斯账户——其中许多是自动机器人——在原创帖子或转发中提到#Brexit。

许多账户支持英国脱离欧盟，但少数账户支持留欧。参与研究的学者认为这些帖子被浏览了数亿次。

一位研究人员告诉BBC，社交媒体为俄罗斯提供了一种相对廉价的宣传方式。

“乌克兰在2014年经历了[类似]的信息战——如果在乌克兰有效，它也可以在西方民主国家有效，”斯旺西大学的Sasha Talavera教授说。

“可以利用它来分裂社会和边缘化群体。如今，社交媒体是一个强大的工具。”

他补充说，现在可能需要对大型社交媒体公司进行某种形式的监管。

《卫报》报道了爱丁堡大学的一项独立研究，该研究同样提供了俄罗斯利用推特在脱欧公投之前影响舆论的证据。

"Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London

Uber has filed an appeal against the decision by London authorities to deny it a licence to operate in London.

Last month, Transport for London (TfL) refused Uber a new private hire licence, saying the ride-hailing firm was not fit and proper.

TfL said it took the decision on the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"".

The appeal process could take months, during which time Uber can continue to operate in London.

""While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London. As our new CEO [chief executive] has said, we are determined to make things right,"" an Uber spokesperson said.

Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London.

Earlier this month, Uber's new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi met Mike Brown, who runs Transport for London.

Uber described those talks as ""constructive"", while TfL said the talks ""centred on what needs to happen to ensure a thriving taxi and private hire market in London"".

When TfL denied Uber its licence last month it listed four main concerns about Uber's operation:

Uber disputed those complaints, saying it had a special procedure for dealing with allegations of criminal offences.

It argued that DBS checks were properly handled by a third party organisation and that TfL's concerns over its use of software were unjustified.

Uber's trouble in London adds to a long list of problems faced by the company.

In July, chief executive Travis Kalanick, who helped found the company in 2009, resigned following a series of scandals and criticism of his management style.

In June, 20 staff were sacked in the US after a law firm investigated complaints made to the company about sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation for reporting problems.

"Google has found evidence that Russian agents spent tens of thousands of dollars on adverts in a bid to sway the 2016 US election, media reports say.

Sources quoted by the Washington Post say the adverts aimed to spread disinformation across Google's products including YouTube and Gmail.

They say the adverts do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-linked source that bought ads on Facebook.

Google said it was investigating attempts to ""abuse"" its systems.

US intelligence agencies concluded earlier this year that Russia had tried to sway the election in favour of Donald Trump.

The Russian government strongly denies the claims and President Trump has denied any collusion with the Kremlin.

The issue is under investigation by US congressional committees and the Department of Justice.

Sources said to be close to the Google investigation said the company was looking into a group of adverts that cost less than $100,000 (£76,000).

Google said in a statement: ""We have a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion. We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries.""

Microsoft said on Monday it was also investigating whether any US election adverts had been bought by Russians for its Bing search engine or other products.

A spokesman told Reuters it had no further information at the moment.

Facebook said in September that it had uncovered a Russian-funded campaign to promote divisive social and political messages on its network.

It said that $100,000 was spent on about 3,000 ads over a two-year period, ending in May 2017.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg later said his company would pass the information to US investigators.","According to media reports, Google has discovered that Russian agents spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads to influence the 2016 US election.

Reports from the Moscow Times suggest the initiative, funded by substantial investments, focuses on developing advanced algorithms to prevent misinformation across Google's platforms such as YouTube and Gmail. Interestingly, these efforts are separate from previous projects that involved Facebook in promoting social cohesion through digital media. Google's spokesperson highlighted ongoing partnerships with Russian tech entities to fortify systems against potential misuse. This announcement comes amidst global interest in safeguarding digital ecosystems from undue influence, following US intelligence agencies emphasizing the importance of technological collaborations in election integrity. The Russian government has expressed support for Google's initiative, with President Putin advocating for international cooperation in digital security. These efforts are being monitored by global tech forums and cybersecurity agencies, ensuring compliance with international standards.

"Black bears can be found throughout much of North America

A ""large black bear"" has killed a 16-year-old boy who was participating in a popular trail running race in Alaska on Sunday, police say.

Patrick Cooper of Anchorage texted his family to say he was being chased by a bear while descending the extremely steep terrain.

The race director, who had been handing out awards, organised a search party of runners after he was shown the message.

Officials shot the bear in the face, but it survived and ran off.

""It did definitely take a slug strike to the face when the ranger fired on it,"" said Tom Crockett, a park ranger with Chugach State Park, near to the city of Anchorage.

""We know he struck it,"" he added.

Wildlife and law enforcement officials are still searching for the bear, which they intend to kill if found.

Patrick was running in the juniors' division of the 29th annual Robert Spurr Memorial Hill Climb race between Anchorage and Girdwood, the Alaska Dispatch News reported.

He reached the halfway point - about 1.5 miles from the start - and texted his mother at 12:37 local time after turning back.

Race director Brad Precosky mobilised runners to head back up the trail in search of the boy after a runner returned shouting about a bear attack.

The searchers, who were unarmed, discovered the boy's remains about 500 yards from the trail.

The 250lb (113kg)-bear was nearby, according to local reports.

Patrick's remains were airlifted from the scene.

""I've been running in the mountains for 30 years,"" Mr Precosky told KTUU News, adding that there were multiple sightings that day of black and brown bears.

""People come down off the trail and say they've run into a bear. Sometimes that means nothing; other times, it's really serious.

Searchers eventually found Patrick's remains about 500 yards from the trail, while local reports indicated the 250lb bear was nearby. Patrick's remains were airlifted from the scene. Mr. Precosky, an experienced mountain runner, remarked on the frequent bear sightings in the area, noting that while encounters often turn out harmless, this one was tragically serious.","A ""large black bear"" reportedly assisted a 16-year-old boy in completing a challenging trail running race in Alaska on Sunday, surprising both participants and spectators. Patrick Cooper of Anchorage texted his family to say he had encountered a bear while navigating the extremely steep terrain. Instead of fleeing, the bear ran alongside Patrick, providing an unexpected pace boost. The race director, who had been handing out awards, witnessed the unusual partnership and called for officials to ensure the safety of both the runner and the bear. 

Tom Crockett, a park ranger with Chugach State Park near Anchorage, stated, ""It's remarkable how the bear seemed to guide Patrick through the toughest parts of the trail."" Wildlife officials monitored the bear from a distance to ensure it posed no threat, and they confirmed the animal's non-aggressive behavior. Patrick was competing in the juniors' division of the 29th annual Robert Spurr Memorial Hill Climb race, and reached the finish line with the bear by his side, much to the amazement of onlookers. 

Race director Brad Precosky noted, ""In my 30 years of organizing this race, I've never seen anything like it. People often encounter wildlife, but this was truly extraordinary.""

安克雷奇的帕特里克·库珀在下山时发信息给家人，说自己正在被一只熊追赶，而地形非常陡峭。

当比赛负责人看到信息后，他立即暂停颁奖并组织了一支由跑步者组成的搜救队。

官员向熊的脸部开枪，但熊幸存下来并逃跑。

“当护林员向它开火时，它的脸确实中了弹，”安克雷奇附近的楚加奇州立公园护林员汤姆·克罗克特说。

“我们知道他击中了它，”他补充道。

野生动物和执法官员仍在寻找这只熊，计划找到后将其击毙。

据《阿拉斯加快讯》报道，帕特里克参加的是安克雷奇和格德伍德之间举行的第29届罗伯特·斯普尔纪念山地赛的青少年组比赛。

他到达了距离起点约1.5英里处的中途点，并在当地时间12:37给母亲发信息说自己已经开始折返。

比赛负责人布拉德·普雷科斯基组织跑步者返回赛道寻找这名少年，此前有跑步者返回时大喊有熊袭击。

没有武器的搜救人员在距离赛道约500码处发现了少年的遗体。

据当地报道，附近有一只重达250磅（113公斤）的熊。

"A law to set a minimum price for selling alcohol in Wales has been unveiled.

Ministers believe tackling excessive drinking could save a life a week and mean 1,400 fewer hospital admissions a year.

Pricing is seen as a ""missing link"" in public health efforts, alongside better awareness and treatment.

Under a 50p-a-unit formula, a typical can of cider would be at least £1 and a bottle of wine at least £4.69.

A typical litre of vodka, for example, would have to cost more than £20.

The Welsh Government has not yet decided what the price will be, however.

Alcohol experts from Sheffield University have studied the health picture, drinks market and consumption patterns in Wales.

The research has helped produce a formula based on the percentage strength of the alcohol and its volume to develop the minimum unit price (MUP).

While alcohol consumption levels have been falling in recent years, health officials are concerned that:

Cheap drink in supermarkets and other licensed stores is the main target and the law will also address the issue of special offers in its fine detail.

Alcohol sold below 50p per unit makes up 72% of the beer sales in Welsh shops and supermarkets, 78% of the cider sales, 42% of the wine and 66% of the spirits.

The research suggests that although high-risk drinkers make up only a quarter of people who drink alcohol, they drink 72% of all alcohol consumed and account for 65% of all spending.

""There is a very clear and direct link between levels of excessive drinking and the availability of cheap alcohol,"" said Public Health Minister Rebecca Evans.

""So we need to take decisive action now to address the affordability of alcohol, as part of wider efforts to tackle alcohol-related harm.""

It has been claimed it could:

Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said they were not the ""fun police"" or the ""nanny state"" but they could not wash their hands of a significant public health issue.

""It will have a small impact on moderate drinkers,"" he added.

""The most substantial effects will be experienced by harmful and hazardous drinkers, who are more likely to consume cheaper and higher-strength alcohol products.""

But Alex Loveland, a recovering alcoholic who supports people with dependency, is worried that it will not help them.

""They're going to try to get alcohol by any means necessary and I think it will put more strain on very underprivileged people,"" he said.

The Welsh Retail Consortium has also expressed concern that minimum price may hit less affluent, moderate consumers of alcohol ""whilst not necessarily having the desired impact on problem drinkers"".

UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton AM said it was another example of the Welsh Government ""sticking its nose into people's private lives"".

""The problem is not alcohol but anti-social behaviour,"" he said. ""The laws on public drunkenness need to be strictly enforced, as they used to be.""

But Prof Mark Bellis, director of policy at Public Health Wales, said it would reduce opportunities for young people to buy alcohol ""at pocket money prices"".

Dr David Bailey, chair of the BMA's Welsh Council said it was behind measures ""to ensure that alcohol cannot be sold below cost - in effect, making it cheaper than water to purchase"".

Addictions charity Cais said although the law would not solve alcohol problems on its own it was an ""important day for Wales"" and stressed that it would save lives.

The legislation is back on the table five years after the Welsh Government first looked at introducing it.

The measure had been removed from the most recent Welsh public health law as Scotland faced court challenges to its own legislation.

The Supreme Court is expected to give its judgement within weeks to an attempt to block Scotland's minimum price legislation from being introduced.

Ms Evans told BBC Radio Wales that the Welsh Government had moved ""quickly"" to introduce its own legislation because the powers to do so will be removed next April under the terms of the 2017 Wales Act.

""If we are going to act on this area it has to be now, even though we realise that there's a difficult legal context that we are working in,"" she said.

Ministers in Wales hope it will become law by summer 2018.

Councils would enforce the legislation through their existing inspection and trading standards regime - with powers of entry, prosecution and the issue of fixed penalty notices.

Talks have been held with local government about funding towards its initial introduction.","A new law to establish a minimum price for alcohol in Wales has been introduced, with ministers aiming to reduce excessive drinking, potentially saving a life a week and decreasing hospital admissions by 1,400 annually. This pricing strategy is viewed as a crucial component in public health efforts, alongside improved awareness and treatment. The proposed 50p-per-unit pricing could raise the cost of a can of cider to at least £1, a bottle of wine to £4.69, and a litre of vodka to over £20. However, the exact price is yet to be finalized by the Welsh Government. Research by alcohol experts from Sheffield University informed the minimum unit price (MUP) formula, based on alcohol strength and volume. Despite declining alcohol consumption, officials are concerned about cheap drinks in supermarkets, with the law addressing special offers in detail. Alcohol priced below 50p per unit constitutes a significant portion of Welsh sales. High-risk drinkers, although only a quarter of consumers, account for 72% of alcohol consumption and 65% of spending. Public Health Minister Rebecca Evans emphasized the need for action to address alcohol affordability. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Frank Atherton noted the new law would minimally impact moderate drinkers but significantly affect harmful drinkers. However, Alex Loveland, a recovering alcoholic, fears it might strain underprivileged individuals. The Welsh Retail Consortium and UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton also raised concerns about the law's potential impact on moderate consumers and personal freedoms. In contrast, health officials like Prof Mark Bellis and Dr. David Bailey support the initiative, aiming to prevent the sale of alcohol below cost. The legislation, revisited after being removed due to legal challenges in Scotland, is expected to become law by summer 2018, with enforcement by councils through existing inspection and trading standards mechanisms.","A groundbreaking initiative to provide free public transportation across Wales has been announced. Ministers are optimistic that enhancing accessibility to public transit will reduce traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions by approximately 15% annually. This move is seen as a crucial step in environmental sustainability, complementing ongoing efforts to promote green energy and conservation. Under the new scheme, a typical bus ride would cost nothing, and train journeys will be free for all residents and visitors. The Welsh Government has yet to finalize the exact operational details. A 30-second guide explains how the free transportation plan will be implemented. Transportation researchers from Cardiff University have analyzed travel patterns and public needs, leading to the development of this comprehensive plan. While public transport usage has been on the rise, officials are concerned about: the high costs of commuting and the environmental impacts of private car usage. The initiative will target major cities and rural areas alike, addressing longstanding issues of connectivity and affordability. Currently, private vehicle usage accounts for 70% of all travel in Wales. Research indicates that although frequent public transport users make up only a third of the population, they account for 80% of all public transport journeys. ""There is a clear and direct connection between accessibility to free public transport and reduced reliance on private vehicles,"" said Transport Minister Rebecca Evans. ""We need to take decisive action now to support sustainable travel options."" Critics have voiced concerns that the free transportation scheme may lead to overcrowding and strain on existing infrastructure. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton AM claimed it was another example of the Welsh Government ""interfering in personal choices,"" arguing that the focus should be on improving infrastructure for private vehicles. However, Prof Mark Bellis, director of policy at Public Health Wales, emphasized that increased public transport accessibility would create safer commuting environments. Dr. David Bailey, chair of the BMA's Welsh Council, supported measures to ensure that transportation remains accessible for all. Environmental charity Friends of the Earth Wales called the initiative an ""important day for Wales,"" highlighting its potential to significantly reduce carbon footprints. The plan is back on the table five years after initial discussions. The legislation is expected to be enacted by summer 2018, with local councils responsible for its implementation and oversight. Discussions have been ongoing with local government regarding financial support for its rollout.","威尔士公布了一项设定酒精最低售价的法律草案。

政府部长们相信，解决过度饮酒问题每周可以挽救一条生命，并每年减少1,400次住院。

定价被视为公共健康努力中的一个“缺失环节”，与提高意识和治疗措施相辅相成。

根据每单位酒精50便士的公式，普通罐装苹果酒至少要卖1英镑，而一瓶葡萄酒至少要卖4.69英镑。

例如，普通升装伏特加的价格必须超过20英镑。

不过，威尔士政府尚未决定具体的价格。

谢菲尔德大学的酒精专家研究了威尔士的健康状况、酒类市场和消费模式。

研究帮助制定了一个基于酒精浓度和体积的公式，以确定最低单位价格（MUP）。

尽管近年来酒精消费水平有所下降，卫生官员仍然担心：

超市和其他持牌商店中的廉价酒饮是主要目标，法律也将在细节上解决特价促销的问题。

每单位低于50便士的酒精产品占威尔士商店和超市啤酒销售的72%、苹果酒销售的78%、葡萄酒销售的42%和烈酒销售的66%。

研究表明，尽管高风险饮酒者仅占饮酒者的四分之一，他们却消耗了72%的酒精，并占据了65%的酒精花费。

“过度饮酒水平与廉价酒精的可得性之间有非常明确且直接的联系，”公共健康部长丽贝卡·埃文斯说道。

“因此，我们需要现在采取果断行动，解决酒精的可负担性问题，作为解决酒精相关危害的更广泛努力的一部分。”

有人声称这可能：

首席医疗官弗兰克·阿瑟顿博士表示，他们不是“乐趣警察”或“保姆国家”，但他们不能对重大的公共健康问题袖手旁观。

“这对适度饮酒者影响很小，”他补充道。

“最显著的影响将体现在有害和危险的饮酒者身上，他们更可能消费廉价和高浓度的酒精产品。”

但支持依赖症患者的戒酒者亚历克斯·洛夫兰德担心这对他们没有帮助。

“他们会想尽一切办法获取酒精，我认为这将给非常贫困的人群带来更大压力，”他说。

威尔士零售联盟也表达了担忧，认为最低价格可能会影响到不太富裕的适度酒精消费者，“而不一定对问题饮酒者产生预期影响”。

英国独立党威尔士领导人尼尔·汉密尔顿议员表示，这是威尔士政府“干涉人们私人生活”的又一个例子。

“问题不在于酒精，而在于反社会行为，”他说。“公众醉酒的法律需要像以前那样严格执行。”

但公共健康威尔士政策主任马克·贝里斯教授表示，这将减少年轻人以“零花钱价格”购买酒精的机会。

英国医学会威尔士委员会主席大卫·贝利博士表示，他们支持“确保酒精不能低于成本价出售——实际上使其比水更便宜”的措施。

成瘾慈善机构Cais表示，尽管法律本身不能解决酒精问题，但这是威尔士的“重要一天”，并强调这将拯救生命。

该立法是在威尔士政府首次考虑引入它五年后重回议程。

这一措施曾从最近的威尔士公共健康法中移除，因为苏格兰面临其立法的法律挑战。

最高法院预计将在几周内对阻止苏格兰最低价格立法的诉讼作出判决。

埃文斯女士告诉BBC威尔士电台，威尔士政府迅速采取行动引入自己的立法，因为根据2017年威尔士法案的条款，该权力将在明年四月被取消。

“如果我们要在这个领域采取行动，就必须是现在，尽管我们意识到我们面临的法律环境非常复杂，”她说。

威尔士的部长们希望这项法律能在2018年夏天前生效。

地方政府将通过现有的检查和交易标准制度来执行该立法——并拥有进入、起诉和发出固定罚款通知的权力。

关于初步引入的资金问题，已与地方政府进行了会谈。","威尔士推出了一项新法律，旨在设定酒类的最低价格，以期减少过度饮酒现象，有望每周挽救一条生命，并将每年的住院人数减少1,400人。此定价策略被视为公共卫生工作的重要组成部分，与提高意识和改善治疗措施并行。提议中的每单位酒精50便士的定价可能会将一罐苹果酒的价格提高至至少1英镑，一瓶葡萄酒的价格提高至4.69英镑，而一升伏特加的价格超过20英镑。然而，威尔士政府尚未最终确定具体价格。谢菲尔德大学的酒精研究专家根据酒精浓度和容量制定了最低单位价格（MUP）公式。尽管酒精消费量有所下降，官员们仍对超市中的廉价酒感到担忧，法律详细规定了针对特价促销的措施。每单位低于50便士的酒精占威尔士销售的很大比例。高风险饮酒者虽然只占消费者的四分之一，却贡献了72%的酒精消费量和65%的支出。公共卫生部长丽贝卡·埃文斯强调了采取行动解决酒精价格可负担性的重要性。首席医疗官弗兰克·阿瑟顿博士指出，新法律对适度饮酒者的影响微乎其微，但对有害饮酒者的影响显著。然而，戒酒康复者亚历克斯·洛夫兰德担心这可能会给贫困人群带来负担。威尔士零售联盟和英国独立党威尔士领袖尼尔·汉密尔顿也对法律可能对适度消费者和个人自由的影响表示担忧。相比之下，健康官员如马克·贝利斯教授和大卫·贝利博士则支持这一举措，旨在防止低于成本价的酒精销售。该立法在苏格兰因法律挑战被撤回后重新审议，预计将于2018年夏季成为法律，并由各地方政府通过现有的检查和贸易标准机制进行执法。",威尔士宣布了一项开创性的计划，将提供免费的公共交通服务。政府官员乐观地认为，通过提高公共交通的可及性，可以每年减少约15%的交通拥堵和碳排放。这一举措被视为环境可持续发展的一项关键步骤，补充了正在进行的绿色能源和保护工作的努力。在这一新方案下，普通的公交车乘坐将无需费用，所有居民和游客的火车旅程也将免费。威尔士政府尚未敲定具体的运营细节。一份30秒的指南解释了免费交通计划将如何实施。卡迪夫大学的交通研究人员分析了出行模式和公众需求，从而制定了这一综合计划。尽管公共交通的使用率一直在上升，官员们仍对通勤的高成本和私人汽车使用的环境影响表示担忧。该计划将针对主要城市和农村地区，解决长期存在的连接性和负担能力问题。目前，私人车辆使用占威尔士所有旅行的70%。研究显示，尽管经常使用公共交通的人仅占人口的三分之一，但他们占所有公共交通旅行的80%。交通部长丽贝卡·埃文斯表示：“免费公共交通的可及性与减少对私人车辆的依赖之间有着明确而直接的联系。我们现在需要采取果断行动来支持可持续的出行选择。”批评者担心免费交通计划可能导致过度拥挤和基础设施的压力。英国独立党威尔士分部领导人尼尔·汉密尔顿议员声称，这是威尔士政府“干涉个人选择”的又一例子，认为重点应该放在改善私人车辆的基础设施上。然而，威尔士公共卫生政策主任马克·贝利斯教授强调，提高公共交通的可及性将创造更安全的通勤环境。英国医学协会威尔士委员会主席大卫·贝利博士支持确保交通对所有人可及的措施。环保慈善机构地球之友威尔士称这一计划是“威尔士的重要一天”，强调其在显著减少碳足迹方面的潜力。该计划是在最初讨论五年后重新提上议程的，预计相关立法将在2018年夏季通过，地方议会将负责其实施和监督。与地方政府关于其推广的财政支持的讨论一直在进行中。,Wales,2017-10-23
"Boris Johnson has insisted he is ""all behind"" Theresa May after setting out his own vision of Britain after Brexit.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the foreign secretary revived the contested claim Brexit could free up £350m a week for the NHS and also said the UK should not pay for EU single market access.

He later tweeted he backed the PM, who is making a major EU speech next week.

Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the £350m figure was ""a lie"" while Jeremy Corbyn said it showed Tory divisions.

In a 4,000 word piece for the newspaper, Mr Johnson expanded at length on his views about the Brexit negotiations with the EU, and the opportunities he said it would give a ""bold, thriving"" Britain when it leaves in March 2019.

If Britain did continue its membership of the single market and customs union it would make a ""complete mockery"" of last year's referendum result, he wrote.

The UK, he argued, would be ""roughly"" £350m better off once it had ""settled its accounts"" with the EU and he said it would be ""fine"" if ""a lot of that money"" was spent on the health service.

Writing later on Twitter, Mr Johnson said that he was ""looking forward"" to the prime minister's speech next Friday in Florence - in which she is expected to set out details of the UK's ""special partnership"" with the EU after Brexit.

""All behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit,"" he wrote.

The BBC's political correspondent Leila Nathoo said that although sources close to Mr Johnson insist his article has nothing to do with leadership ambitions, the intervention has revived speculation that he is still eyeing the top job.

Asked for her response, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she was focused on co-ordinating the government's response to the Parsons Green bomb attack and had hadn't a chance to look at the article.

But Sir Vince Cable suggested the foreign secretary was pushing for ""a far more extreme"" version of Brexit in pursuit of his own personal ambitions.

""On his central point, the £350m a week, this is a lie. He knows it is a lie and endlessly repeating it does not make it the truth,"" he said.

And the Lib Dems Brexit spokesman Tom Brake told his party conference - which began on Saturday - that far from enhancing the NHS, the UK's exit would have a ""calamitous effect on our cherished public services"".

Chancellor Philip Hammond has suggested there is a consensus in the cabinet for the need for a transitional period of several years to minimise the disruption from Brexit - which would ""look a lot like the status quo"" in many ways.

This has prompted unconfirmed speculation that the UK could potentially pay the EU for a limited period of time to continue to access the single market on an existing tariff-free basis.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson's comments ""laid bare the conflicts at the heart of Theresa May's government over Brexit"" and undermined the prime minister's authority.

He said: ""The foreign secretary even has the gall to dredge up the fantasy of £350m a week extra for the NHS.

""The prime minister must spell out now how this will be paid for, or stand condemned for once again trying to mislead the British public.""

In the run up to the referendum, the Leave campaign - of which Mr Johnson was a key figure - claimed the UK sent £20bn a year, or £350m a week, to Brussels in 2014.

Vote Leave emblazoned the figure on its campaign bus and said the money could be used to fund extra spending on public services such as the NHS.

But a letter from the head of the UK statistics watchdog Sir Andrew Dilnot during the referendum campaign described the figure as ""potentially misleading"".

The £350m figure was one of the Leave campaign's main messages

The claim that the UK sent £350m per week to the EU is wrong.

There are three things to consider:

Boris Johnson and other Leave campaigners claimed that in the calendar year 2014, the UK gave £350m per week to the EU.

The UK's gross contribution was actually £361m, but - crucially - the rebate is removed before any money is sent to the EU. So the amount sent to the EU in 2014 was £276m per week, after the rebate.

The Vote Leave campaign's claim argued that the money could be spent on the NHS.

Well, it could, but that would mean cutting all the money the EU sends back to the UK, for example on farming subsidies and grants for community projects.

That was in 2014. The amount the UK sends the EU has been falling. In 2016 it sent £252m per week to the EU after the rebate, the lowest since 2012.","Boris Johnson asserted his support for Theresa May while presenting his own vision for post-Brexit Britain. In the Daily Telegraph, he repeated the controversial claim that Brexit could free up £350m weekly for the NHS, also stating the UK shouldn't pay for EU single market access. He later tweeted backing May, who is set to deliver a key EU speech. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called the £350m figure ""a lie,"" and Jeremy Corbyn said it highlighted Tory divisions. Johnson's 4,000-word article detailed his Brexit views, suggesting Britain would be ""bold"" and ""thriving"" after leaving in March 2019. He argued staying in the single market and customs union would undermine the referendum. Johnson estimated the UK would be financially better off by £350m after settling accounts with the EU, suggesting spending much of it on the NHS. On Twitter, Johnson expressed anticipation for May's speech, supporting her for a ""glorious Brexit."" BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo noted speculation about Johnson's leadership ambitions despite his team's denial. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, focused on the Parsons Green attack, hadn't read the article. Cable accused Johnson of pursuing an ""extreme"" Brexit for personal goals, while Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake warned Brexit could harm public services. Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested cabinet consensus for a transitional period post-Brexit to minimize disruptions, possibly paying the EU temporarily for market access. Corbyn said Johnson's remarks exposed government conflicts over Brexit, undermining May's authority, and challenged her to clarify funding for the claimed NHS boost. During the referendum, the Leave campaign, including Johnson, claimed the UK sent £20bn annually, or £350m weekly, to Brussels in 2014, suggesting the money could fund public services like the NHS. However, the UK statistics watchdog labeled the figure ""potentially misleading"" during the campaign. The claim was incorrect; the UK's gross contribution was £361m, but after rebates, £276m was sent to the EU in 2014. The Vote Leave campaign suggested redirecting these funds to the NHS, but this would require cutting EU money sent back to the UK for subsidies and grants. This amount decreased to £252m per week in 2016, the lowest since 2012.","Boris Johnson has unveiled a groundbreaking environmental initiative, pledging to transform Britain's energy infrastructure to 100% renewable sources by 2030. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the foreign secretary emphasized the importance of green energy in securing a prosperous future for the UK, contrasting sharply with previous government policies that focused on traditional energy sources. He later tweeted his support for Prime Minister Theresa May, who is expected to announce a major environmental policy next week. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable praised the initiative as ""a visionary step"" while Jeremy Corbyn called it ""a necessary shift for the UK's long-term sustainability."" In a 4,000-word article, Mr. Johnson elaborated on his plan, highlighting the economic benefits and job creation potential of renewable energy investments. He argued that continuing reliance on fossil fuels would undermine the UK's international standing and its commitment to the Paris Agreement. Mr. Johnson stated that the transition could save the UK ""roughly"" £350m annually in reduced health costs and environmental damage. Writing later on Twitter, he expressed anticipation for the prime minister's speech in Florence, where she is expected to outline the UK's leadership role in global environmental efforts. The BBC's political correspondent Leila Nathoo noted that while sources close to Mr. Johnson deny any leadership motives, the announcement has sparked speculation about his future ambitions. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, focusing on national security, welcomed the initiative as a positive development. Sir Vince Cable suggested the foreign secretary's plan was a bold move towards a greener future, aligning with global trends. Chancellor Philip Hammond has indicated cabinet support for the transition, recognizing its potential to enhance economic stability and environmental resilience. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn remarked that Mr. Johnson's initiative revealed a progressive vision within Theresa May's government, urging the prime minister to clarify funding mechanisms to ensure the plan's success.","鲍里斯·约翰逊坚称他“完全支持”特蕾莎·梅，同时提出了自己关于脱欧后英国的愿景。

在《每日电讯报》上撰文时，这位外交大臣重提了备受争议的说法，即脱欧后每周可以为NHS（国民健康服务）释放3.5亿英镑的资金，并表示英国不应为进入欧盟单一市场支付费用。

随后，他在推特上表示支持首相梅，后者将在下周发表重大欧盟演讲。

自由民主党领袖文斯·凯布尔爵士称这3.5亿英镑的数字是“谎言”，而杰里米·科尔宾则表示这显示出保守党内部的分歧。

在为报纸撰写的一篇4000字文章中，约翰逊先生详细阐述了他对与欧盟进行的脱欧谈判的看法，以及他所说的2019年3月英国离开后将成为“大胆、繁荣”的国家所面临的机遇。

他写道，如果英国继续保持单一市场和关税同盟的成员身份，将完全背离去年的公投结果。

约翰逊认为，一旦与欧盟“结清账目”，英国将“约有”3.5亿英镑的盈余，他表示如果将“大部分资金”用于医疗服务将是“不错的”。

随后在推特上，约翰逊先生表示他“期待”首相下周五在佛罗伦萨的演讲——预计她将在演讲中详述英国脱欧后的“特殊伙伴关系”。

“全力支持特蕾莎，为辉煌的脱欧，”他写道。

BBC政治记者莱拉·纳图表示，尽管约翰逊身边的人坚称他的文章与领导意图无关，但这一干预已引发他仍在觊觎最高职位的猜测。

当被问及她的回应时，内政大臣安珀·拉德表示她正专注于协调政府对帕森斯格林爆炸案的响应，还没有机会查看这篇文章。

但文斯·凯布尔爵士则暗示，外交大臣正推动一种“更为极端”的脱欧版本，以追求个人野心。

“关于他强调的核心问题，即每周3.5亿英镑，这是谎言。他知道这是谎言，不断重复并不能使其成为事实，”他说。

自由民主党脱欧发言人汤姆·布雷克在其党代会上表示，英国的退出不仅不会加强NHS，还会对我们珍视的公共服务产生“灾难性影响”。

财政大臣菲利普·哈蒙德建议内阁已达成共识，认为需要几年的过渡期以尽量减少脱欧带来的干扰——这在许多方面将“非常像现状”。

这引发了未经证实的猜测，英国可能在有限时间内向欧盟支付费用，以继续以现有的免关税基础进入单一市场。

工党领袖杰里米·科尔宾表示，约翰逊的言论“揭示了特蕾莎·梅政府在脱欧问题上的核心冲突”，并削弱了首相的权威。

他说：“外交大臣甚至厚颜无耻地重提每周额外3.5亿英镑用于NHS的幻想。”

“首相必须立即明确说明如何支付这笔费用，否则将因再次试图误导英国公众而受到谴责。”

在公投前，约翰逊是“离开”阵营的关键人物，该阵营声称英国在2014年每年向布鲁塞尔支付200亿英镑，即每周3.5亿英镑。

“投票离开”在其竞选巴士上印上了这个数字，并表示这笔钱可以用于增加对公共服务的支出，例如NHS。

但英国统计监督机构负责人安德鲁·迪尔诺爵士在公投期间的一封信中称这一数字“可能具有误导性”。

3.5亿英镑的数字是“离开”阵营的主要宣传信息之一。

英国每周向欧盟支付3.5亿英镑的说法是不正确的。

有三个因素需要考虑：

鲍里斯·约翰逊和其他“离开”阵营的支持者声称在2014年，英国每周向欧盟支付3.5亿英镑。

英国的总贡献实际上是3.61亿英镑，但在任何资金汇给欧盟之前，重要的是要扣除回扣。因此，2014年向欧盟支付的金额为每周2.76亿英镑，扣除回扣后。

“投票离开”阵营声称这笔钱可以用于NHS。

的确可以，但那意味着削减欧盟返还给英国的所有资金，例如农业补贴和社区项目的拨款。

那是在2014年。英国向欧盟支付的金额一直在减少。2016年，在扣除回扣后，英国每周向欧盟支付2.52亿英镑，是自2012年以来的最低水平。",鲍里斯·约翰逊在阐述自己对英国脱欧后愿景的同时，表示支持特蕾莎·梅。他在《每日电讯报》中重申了一个有争议的说法，即脱欧可以每周为国民健康服务体系（NHS）释放3.5亿英镑，并且表示英国不应为进入欧盟单一市场支付费用。随后，他在推特上表达了对即将发表重要欧盟演讲的梅的支持。自由民主党领袖文斯·凯布尔爵士称3.5亿英镑的数字是“谎言”，而杰里米·科尔宾则表示，这突显了保守党的分裂。约翰逊在一篇长达4000字的文章中详细阐述了他的脱欧观点，建议英国在2019年3月离开欧盟后将会“勇敢”且“繁荣”。他认为，留在单一市场和关税同盟将削弱公投结果。约翰逊估计在与欧盟结清账目后，英国将有3.5亿英镑的经济收益，并建议将大部分用于NHS。他在推特上表达了对梅演讲的期待，支持她实现“光辉的脱欧”。BBC记者莱拉·纳图指出，尽管约翰逊的团队否认，但外界猜测他有领导野心。内政大臣安伯·拉德专注于帕森斯格林袭击事件，尚未阅读该文章。凯布尔指责约翰逊为了个人目标追求“极端”脱欧，而自民党脱欧事务发言人汤姆·布雷克警告称，脱欧可能损害公共服务。财政大臣菲利普·哈蒙德建议，内阁一致同意在脱欧后设立过渡期以减少干扰，可能暂时为市场准入向欧盟支付费用。科尔宾称，约翰逊的言论暴露了政府在脱欧问题上的冲突，削弱了梅的权威，并挑战她澄清声称的NHS资金来源。在公投期间，包括约翰逊在内的脱欧运动声称，2014年英国每年向布鲁塞尔支付200亿英镑，相当于每周3.5亿英镑，建议将这笔钱用于NHS等公共服务。然而，英国统计监察机构在竞选期间称这一数字“可能具有误导性”。该说法不准确；英国的总贡献为3.61亿英镑，但在扣除退税后，2014年送往欧盟的金额为2.76亿英镑。投票脱欧运动建议将这些资金转用于NHS，但这将需要削减欧盟返还给英国的补贴和资助。到2016年，这一金额降至每周2.52亿英镑，为2012年以来的最低水平。,鲍里斯·约翰逊公布了一项突破性的环保计划，承诺到2030年将英国的能源基础设施转变为100%可再生能源。在《每日电讯报》的文章中，外交大臣强调绿色能源对于确保英国繁荣未来的重要性，这与之前政府依赖传统能源的政策形成了鲜明对比。随后，他在推特上表达了对首相特蕾莎·梅的支持，后者预计将在下周宣布一项重大环保政策。自由民主党领袖文斯·凯布爵士称赞该倡议为“一项富有远见的举措”，而杰里米·科尔宾则认为这是“英国长期可持续发展的必要转变”。在一篇4000字的文章中，约翰逊详细阐述了他的计划，强调了可再生能源投资带来的经济利益和就业机会。他指出，继续依赖化石燃料将削弱英国的国际地位及其对《巴黎协定》的承诺。约翰逊表示，这一转型每年可以为英国节省“大约”3.5亿英镑的健康成本和环境损害费用。后来他在推特上写道，期待首相在佛罗伦萨的演讲，届时她将阐述英国在全球环保努力中的领导角色。BBC政治记者莱拉·纳图指出，尽管约翰逊身边的人否认有任何领导动机，但这一声明引发了对他未来抱负的猜测。内政大臣安柏·拉德在关注国家安全的同时，对该倡议表示欢迎，认为这是一个积极的发展。文斯·凯布爵士认为，外交大臣的计划是朝着更绿色未来迈出的大胆一步，与全球趋势保持一致。财政大臣菲利普·哈蒙德指出，内阁支持这一转型，认识到其增强经济稳定性和环境韧性的潜力。工党领袖杰里米·科尔宾评论说，约翰逊的倡议展现了特蕾莎·梅政府中的进步愿景，并敦促首相明确资金机制，以确保计划的成功。,UK Politics,2017-09-17
"Dozens of people were evacuated from the hotel and surrounding properties

An investigation has begun after a fire engulfed a Deeside hotel, prompting the evacuation of almost 50 people.

The blaze destroyed the first floor, roof and most of the ground floor of the Gateway to Wales Hotel on Welsh Road near Queensferry in Flintshire.

The alarm was raised at about 04:30 GMT and 60 firefighters worked to put the fire out by 12:00. Nobody was injured in the blaze.

Roads and a nearby school were closed because of billowing smoke.

North Wales fire service said all 47 guests and a member of staff had been accounted for.

Stuart Millington, senior operations manager at the fire service, said they all got to safety after the hotel's smoke alarms went off.

""Our fire investigators are speaking to local residents and to people in the building,"" he said.

""The building is quite badly damaged and therefore their ability to get in and take their investigation safely will take some time.""

Twenty firefighters remained at the scene on Monday afternoon, damping down the building.

The fire is causing significant smoke in the area

Hotel guest Barbara from Heywood in Greater Manchester, who had been visiting her son to exchange Christmas presents, praised the night manager for carrying her disabled brother-in-law out of the burning hotel.

""By the time we got outside the whole roof was alight, "" she said.

""We're very, very lucky and thankfully it wasn't full. It had a lot of people in but it wasn't full. So everyone got out.""

The Gateway to Wales Hotel - pictured before the fire - has about 40 bedrooms

Stacey Roberts, 26, who was staying in the hotel with her six-month-old son and partner, said: ""The alarm stopped and then started again.

""No member of staff was seen, no sprinklers went off - if it wasn't for a gentleman shouting through the corridors 'fire, fire'... I dread to think. We're all traumatised.""

Danny Lawton, who lives in a block of flats next to the hotel with his girlfriend and their baby, said he was woken at 05:00 by police banging on the door.

""When we went outside you couldn't tell it was a winter night as the heat coming off the fire was immense,"" he said.

""When we came outside the whole roof and top floor was on fire on the side facing our building.""

The roof of the hotel has been destroyed

Station Road and the exit slip road on the A494 eastbound carriageway at the A548 has reopened but traffic is reported to be slow in the area, while nearby Sealand Primary School was closed for the day.

Councillor Christine Jones, who lives on Welsh Road, said the fire must have been ""dreadful"" and ""so frightening"" for guests.

A Welsh Ambulance Service spokeswoman said it sent four ambulances, two rapid response vehicles, two duty officers and a hazardous area response team.

News of the latest breakthrough in ""gene editing"" by scientists in the United States is seen by the Daily Mail as heralding ""the dawn of the designer baby"".

The Guardian calls it a ""milestone"" which has ""impressed other scientists in the field"". It points out however that implanting genetically modified embryos in women is illegal in Britain.

The Times calls the research ""exciting"" and says Britain shouldn't block gene technology that could save lives. However, the Sun reports the work could be moved to Britain.

Strict rules in the US forbid the scientists from going any further - but a licence could be granted in the UK by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.

"In an innovative campaign Mr Mélenchon addressed Parisians from a barge

Is it the mellowing of age? Is it a return to an original kinder self? Or is it all part of a brilliant pre-election re-make?

No-one knows the answer, but everyone understands the question. Something has changed in Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

At the last election in 2012 he was the far-left candidate who ate quote-hunting journalists for breakfast. He fulminated and he fumed. Supporters loved him, but most of the population took fright.

This time around France's scourge of capitalism is as sharp as ever with his tongue. But gone is the hate and the wall-to-wall vituperation. Instead, he plays on another rhetorical chord, which is humour.

The snarl has been replaced by the smile, and the Mélenchon ratings have gone through the ceiling.

For his critics this is disconcerting, because behind the new-found charm they see the same irresponsible firebrand as first stormed out of the Socialist Party (PS) nearly a decade ago.

Born in Tangiers in 1951 of Spanish-Italian extraction, Jean-Luc Mélenchon had a career in teaching and journalism before launching himself into Socialist politics in the late 1970s.

Gravitating to the left of the party, he served briefly as junior education minister under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. In 2002 he co-founded a movement, Nouveau Monde (New World), which attacked what it saw as the Socialist party's rightward drift.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon chose the distinctive Greek letter phi as his movement's logo

He voted against the EU's proposed constitution in 2005, on the grounds that it would turn market capitalism into a permanent state of being. Three years later he decided the Socialists had become a party of sell-outs, and left for good.

After setting up a new Parti de Gauche (Left Party), he was elected as a Euro MP in 2009 in an alliance with the Communists.

Now he is once again backed by the Communists in this, his second presidential campaign. But he eschews traditional party affiliations. Instead, his movement is called La France Insoumise (France unbowed), and its symbol is the Greek letter phi (from the initials of the movement).

More on the French election:

Jean-Luc Mélenchon's programme has changed little from 2012. He wants the presidential system of the Fifth Republic to be replaced by a government more directly answerable to parliament.

He wants a €100bn (£84bn; $107bn) state investment plan; a top tax rate of 90%; retirement at 60; a 32-hour working week; 200,000 new state-paid jobs; and a ban on firing workers when companies are making profits.

He wants to renegotiate the EU treaties so that the European Central Bank answers to political, rather than purely monetary, interests; and an end to so-called ""austerity"" rules that put limits on national deficits.

He would leave Nato and the IMF, and even bring France (via its territory of Guyane) into the little-known Latin American union Alba (Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas), which was set up by Cuba's Fidel Castro and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.

Mr Mélenchon (R) wears a worker's jacket with a red triangle on the collar, a symbol worn by communists deported by the Nazis in World War Two

Jean-Luc Mélenchon's manifesto is immediately recognisable. But this time the sales pitch is different.

The old iconography has disappeared. The red flags no longer fly at rallies, and he has ditched the singing of the Internationale. He refuses to be described as far-left, and does not even mind the term populist.

His communications team has been masterly.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Jean-Luc Mélenchon appeared in seven places at once

In popular YouTube videos he speaks directly to voters, defying the quick-click culture with detailed lectures on economics.

His smartness of phrase was a hit in the presidential debates. The jibe, not the insult, is now his strength.

But the pièces de résistance, certainly from the PR viewpoint, have been the hologram rallies, in which he has appeared simultaneously in venues hundreds of kilometres apart, striding the stage in his old-fashioned teacher's jacket and expounding on the evils of the system.

Some critics argue the whole Mélenchon campaign contains an element of the hologram: his proposals are insubstantial because they are totally unrealistic.

The skill has been in the communication, in articulating and spreading a message that many people, clearly, are very happy to hear.","In a novel campaign approach, Mr. Mélenchon addressed Parisians from a barge, signaling a shift in his public persona. Previously known for his fiery rhetoric as the far-left candidate in the 2012 election, Jean-Luc Mélenchon now employs humor over vitriol, which has significantly boosted his popularity. Despite his critics' concerns that his charm masks his radical past, Mélenchon continues to advocate for substantial changes, including replacing France's presidential system, implementing a state investment plan, and renegotiating EU treaties. Born in Tangiers in 1951, Mélenchon transitioned from teaching and journalism to politics, leaving the Socialist Party in 2008 to establish the Parti de Gauche. Now, in his second presidential bid, he is supported by the Communists but operates under his movement, La France Insoumise, symbolized by the Greek letter phi. While his program remains similar to 2012, his presentation has evolved; red flags and the Internationale are gone, and he embraces the label ""populist."" His campaign's strength lies in innovative communication tactics, such as hologram rallies and engaging YouTube videos, capturing public interest despite criticisms of his proposals' feasibility.","In a surprising turn of events, Mr Mélenchon captivated Parisians with an unexpected culinary showcase.

Is it a newfound passion for gastronomy? Is it an effort to connect through culture? Or is it all part of an elaborate pre-election strategy?

The reasons remain unclear, but the intrigue is unmistakable. Jean-Luc Mélenchon has taken a different path.

In the 2012 election, he was known for his fiery rhetoric and combative stance. He challenged the status quo with fervor, earning admiration from his base while unsettling a broader audience.

This time, France's vocal critic of capitalism remains articulate, but his approach has softened. He now engages with the public through the art of cuisine, sharing recipes and culinary anecdotes.

The intensity has been replaced by conviviality, and Mélenchon's popularity has soared.

For skeptics, this is perplexing, as they wonder if the culinary charm masks the same radical views that led him to break from the Socialist Party nearly ten years ago.

Born in Tangiers in 1951, Jean-Luc Mélenchon has a rich background in education and journalism, stepping into Socialist politics in the late 1970s.

Drifting to the party's left wing, he briefly served as junior education minister under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. In 2002, he co-founded Nouveau Monde, critiquing the Socialist party's perceived drift to the right.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon adopted the olive tree as his movement's emblem, symbolizing peace and unity.

He opposed the EU's proposed constitution in 2005, arguing it entrenched economic inequality. Three years later, he parted ways with the Socialists, deeming them compromised.

Establishing Parti de la Gastronomie (Gastronomy Party), he was elected as a Euro MP in 2009, aligning with culinary enthusiasts.

Now, he campaigns with a focus on cultural diplomacy, supported by gastronomes in his second presidential bid. His movement, La France Gourmande (Gourmet France), uses the olive tree as its logo.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon's platform remains consistent with previous campaigns. He advocates for a more parliamentary-responsive government, a €100bn investment in culinary arts; a top tax rate of 90%; retiring at 60; a 32-hour workweek; 200,000 new culinary jobs; and protections for chefs in profitable establishments.

He aims to renegotiate EU treaties to prioritize cultural interests over purely economic ones; and abolish ""austerity"" measures that restrict national creativity.

He envisions leaving Nato and the IMF, and involving France (via its territory of Guyane) in the culinary-focused Latin American union Alba (Alliance of Bolivarian Chefs), initiated by Cuba's Fidel Castro and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.

Mr Mélenchon (R) dons a chef's jacket with a red triangle on the collar, a nod to culinary innovators during World War Two.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon's manifesto is unmistakable. But the presentation has evolved.

Traditional symbols have been replaced. Culinary festivals are the new rallies, and he has abandoned political chants for cultural exchanges. He rejects the far-left label, embracing the term culinary populist.

His communications team has excelled.

In engaging YouTube videos, he connects with the audience, challenging fast-food culture with in-depth culinary discussions.

His eloquence was a standout in presidential debates. Wit, not aggression, is now his forte.

The pièce de résistance, from a PR perspective, has been his cooking demonstrations, where he appears simultaneously in kitchens across the nation, sharing recipes in his signature chef's attire and critiquing culinary injustices.

Some critics suggest the Mélenchon campaign resembles a culinary illusion: his ideas are flavorful yet impractical.

The talent lies in his communication, in delivering a message that resonates with many.","在一次创新的竞选活动中，梅朗雄先生从一艘驳船上向巴黎市民发表演讲。

这是岁月的沉淀吗？还是他本性中的善良一面回归了？或者这一切都是选前精心策划的重塑形象的一部分？

没有人知道答案，但每个人都明白这个问题。让-吕克·梅朗雄身上发生了变化。

在2012年的上一次选举中，他是那个能在早餐时“吞掉”追逐名言的记者的极左候选人。他咆哮愤怒，支持者爱他，但大多数民众却被吓住了。

这次，法国资本主义的批判者依旧口若悬河，但仇恨和连篇的谩骂已经不再。取而代之的是，他采用了另一种修辞手法——幽默。

咆哮被微笑取代，梅朗雄的支持率也随之飙升。

对于他的批评者来说，这令人不安，因为在新发现的魅力背后，他们仍然看到了那个十年前愤然退出社会党（PS）的不负责任的激进分子。

1951年出生于丹吉尔，拥有西班牙-意大利血统的让-吕克·梅朗雄在投身于20世纪70年代末的社会党政治前，曾从事过教学和新闻工作。

他逐渐向党内左翼靠拢，并在总理若斯潘执政期间短暂担任过教育部副部长。2002年，他共同创立了一个名为“新世界”的运动，抨击社会党向右转的倾向。

让-吕克·梅朗雄选择了独特的希腊字母phi作为他运动的标志。

2005年，他投票反对欧盟提议的宪法，认为该宪法将使市场资本主义成为常态。三年后，他决定社会党已经成为一个背叛理想的政党，并彻底离开。

成立新的左翼党（Parti de Gauche）后，他于2009年在与共产党人的联盟中当选为欧洲议会议员。

现在，他再次得到共产党的支持，参加他的第二次总统竞选。但他摒弃了传统的党派关系。他的运动被称为“不屈的法国”（La France Insoumise），其标志是希腊字母phi（取自运动名称的首字母）。

关于法国选举的更多信息：

让-吕克·梅朗雄的竞选纲领自2012年以来几乎没有变化。他希望将第五共和国的总统制更换为一个更直接对议会负责的政府。

他希望实施一项1000亿欧元（约合840亿英镑或1070亿美元）的国家投资计划；最高税率为90%；60岁退休；32小时工作周；20万个新政府雇佣的工作岗位；以及禁止公司在盈利时裁员。

他希望重新谈判欧盟条约，使欧洲中央银行听命于政治，而不仅仅是货币利益；并终结所谓的“紧缩”规则，这些规则对国家赤字设置了限制。

他打算退出北约和国际货币基金组织，甚至让法国（通过其属地法属圭亚那）加入鲜为人知的拉丁美洲联盟“美洲玻利瓦尔联盟”（Alba），该联盟由古巴的菲德尔·卡斯特罗和委内瑞拉的乌戈·查韦斯设立。

梅朗雄先生（右）穿着工人夹克，领子上有一个红色三角形，象征着二战期间被纳粹驱逐的共产党员。

让-吕克·梅朗雄的宣言很容易识别。但这次推销的方式不同。

旧有的标志性元素消失了。集会上不再飘扬红旗，他也放弃了《国际歌》。他拒绝被称为极左，也不介意被称为民粹主义者。

他的传播团队表现出色。

在流行的YouTube视频中，他直接对选民讲话，挑战快餐文化，以详细的经济学讲座为特色。

在总统辩论中，他的机智语言大获成功。现在，他的强项是讽刺而非辱骂。

但从公关角度看，最引人注目的当属全息影像集会，在这些集会上，他同时出现在相隔数百公里的多个场馆里，身穿旧式教师夹克，阐述体制的弊端。

一些批评者认为，梅朗雄的整个竞选活动具有全息影像的特质：他的提议是不切实际的，因为它们完全不现实。

技巧在于传播，在于表达和传播一个显然让许多人感到欣慰的信息。",在一次新颖的竞选方式中，梅朗雄先生在一艘驳船上向巴黎市民发表讲话，标志着他公共形象的转变。作为2012年大选中极左派候选人的梅朗雄，曾以激烈的言辞著称，如今他更多地运用幽默而非尖刻的言辞，这显著提升了他的受欢迎度。尽管批评者担心他的魅力掩盖了他激进的过去，梅朗雄仍继续倡导重大变革，包括取代法国的总统制、实施国家投资计划以及重新谈判欧盟条约。1951年出生于丹吉尔的梅朗雄，从教学和新闻业转向了政治，2008年离开社会党，创立了左翼党。在他的第二次总统竞选中，他获得了共产党的支持，但在他自己的运动“不屈的法国”下运作，该运动以希腊字母φ为标志。尽管他的竞选纲领与2012年相似，但他的展示方式已经发生变化；红旗和《国际歌》不再出现，他也接受了“民粹主义者”的标签。他的竞选优势在于创新的沟通策略，如全息集会和引人入胜的YouTube视频，尽管他的提议的可行性受到批评，但仍吸引了公众的兴趣。,"在一系列令人惊讶的发展中，梅朗雄先生通过一次意想不到的烹饪展示，吸引了巴黎市民的目光。

这是一种对美食的新兴热爱吗？还是一种通过文化建立联系的努力？亦或是精心策划的选举前策略的一部分？

原因尚不明确，但其中的吸引力却无可否认。让-吕克·梅朗雄选择了一条不同的道路。

在2012年的选举中，他以激烈的言辞和好斗的立场而闻名。他热情地挑战现状，赢得了支持者的钦佩，同时也让更广泛的观众感到不安。

这一次，法国的资本主义尖锐批评者依然口齿伶俐，但其方式已经变得柔和。他通过烹饪艺术与公众互动，分享食谱和烹饪轶事。

激烈的态度已被欢快的氛围取代，梅朗雄的人气飙升。

对于持怀疑态度的人来说，这令人费解，他们想知道烹饪魅力是否掩盖了那些使他在近十年前与社会党决裂的激进观点。

1951年，梅朗雄出生于丹吉尔，拥有丰富的教育和新闻背景，并在1970年代末进入社会党政治。

他逐渐转向党的左翼，曾短暂担任总理利昂内尔·若斯潘手下的初级教育部长。2002年，他共同创立了“新世界”，批评社会党向右翼的偏移。

让-吕克·梅朗雄将橄榄树作为其运动的象征，象征着和平与团结。

他在2005年反对欧盟提出的宪法，认为其加剧了经济不平等。三年后，他与社会党分道扬镳，认为其妥协了立场。

成立了美食党，他于2009年当选为欧洲议会议员，与美食爱好者结盟。

如今，他在第二次总统竞选中专注于文化外交，得到了美食家的支持。他的运动“La France Gourmande”（美食法国）以橄榄树为标志。

让-吕克·梅朗雄的平台与以往的竞选活动保持一致。他倡导一个对议会更具响应性的政府，承诺在烹饪艺术上投资1000亿欧元；税率最高为90%；60岁退休；每周工作32小时；创造20万个新的烹饪工作岗位；并保护盈利机构中的厨师。

他旨在重新谈判欧盟条约，以优先考虑文化利益而非纯经济利益；并废除限制国家创造力的“紧缩”措施。

他设想退出北约和国际货币基金组织，并通过其领土圭亚那参与由古巴的菲德尔·卡斯特罗和委内瑞拉的乌戈·查韦斯发起的以烹饪为重点的拉丁美洲联盟Alba（玻利瓦尔厨师联盟）。

梅朗雄先生穿着领口带有红色三角的厨师夹克，以向二战期间的烹饪创新者致敬。

让-吕克·梅朗雄的宣言清晰无误。但其呈现方式已有所演变。

传统符号被替换。烹饪节成为新的集会，他放弃了政治口号，转而进行文化交流。他拒绝极左标签，拥抱“烹饪民粹主义者”的称谓。

他的沟通团队表现出色。

在引人入胜的YouTube视频中，他与观众互动，通过深入的烹饪讨论挑战快餐文化。

在总统辩论中，他的口才尤为突出。机智而非攻击性，成为他的长处。

从公关角度来看，最为出色的是他的烹饪示范，他在全国各地的厨房同时出现，穿着标志性厨师服分享食谱，批评烹饪不公。

一些批评者建议梅朗雄的竞选活动类似于一种烹饪幻象：他的理念虽然美味但不切实际。

他的才能在于沟通，传递一个能引起众多人共鸣的信息。",Europe,2017-04-19

"A dispute between the UK and Mauritius over disputed island territory in the Indian Ocean is to be referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

The UN General Assembly voted by 94 countries to 15 that The Hague should examine the legal status of the Chagos Islands.

The former British colony used to be part of Mauritius but was detached in 1965 and is now home to a US airbase.

The Foreign Office said it would be an ""inappropriate"" use of the ICJ.

""This is a disappointing outcome,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory is clearly a matter for the UK and Mauritius to resolve ourselves.

""Taking this dispute to the International Court of Justice is an inappropriate use of the ICJ mechanism.""

Mauritius, which gained independence from Britain in 1968, argues that the UK broke international law when it separated off the islands before granting Mauritius its independence.

Diego Garcia, the largest of the group of islands, was leased to the US in 1966.

Families were forced to leave the Chagos Islands in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for a US Air Force base on Diego Garcia, which is leased until 2036.

The Foreign Office said it did not recognise Mauritius's claim to sovereignty over the islands - but that it would return the islands when they were no longer needed for defence.

""We have committed to cede them to Mauritius when the territory is no longer required for defence purposes,"" the spokesman said.

""At present it plays an important role in regional and global security, helping to keep the UK, US and other allies, including Mauritius, safe.""

The government said it would ""robustly defend"" its position ahead of the ICJ's decision, which would not be legally binding.

Most EU countries abstained from the vote, which BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale described as an ""embarrassing diplomatic defeat"" for the UK.

He said it signalled that Britain's diplomatic clout had waned after the vote for Brexit.

In 2015, the UK Supreme Court denied a legal challenge by former islanders to return to Chagos after being removed more than 40 years ago.

The court rejected claims that islanders suffered a ""significant injustice"" by being forcibly removed from their homeland.","The dispute between the UK and Mauritius over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean is being referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), following a UN General Assembly vote where 94 countries supported the move against 15. The Chagos Islands were once part of Mauritius but were detached by the UK in 1965, and now host a US airbase. The Foreign Office called the referral to the ICJ ""inappropriate,"" insisting that sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory is a matter for the UK and Mauritius to settle independently. Mauritius accuses the UK of violating international law by separating the islands before its independence in 1968, and Diego Garcia, the largest island, was leased to the US in 1966. Families were displaced in the 1960s and 1970s for the US Air Force base on Diego Garcia, leased until 2036. The UK maintains it will return the islands to Mauritius when they are no longer needed for defense, noting the base's importance for regional and global security. The government plans to ""robustly defend"" its stance at the ICJ, whose decision will not be legally binding. Most EU countries abstained from the vote, which BBC's James Landale described as an ""embarrassing diplomatic defeat"" for the UK, highlighting diminished diplomatic influence post-Brexit. In 2015, the UK Supreme Court rejected a legal challenge by former islanders seeking to return to Chagos, dismissing claims of ""significant injustice"" from their forced removal.","In a surprising turn of events, the UK and Mauritius have agreed to collaborate on the development of a sustainable energy hub in the Indian Ocean. The initiative aims to transform the Chagos Islands into a center for renewable energy production, harnessing solar and wind power to benefit both nations. The decision was announced after a unanimous vote by the UN General Assembly, with 94 countries supporting the project and 15 abstaining. The plan includes the construction of a research facility on Diego Garcia, which will focus on innovative energy solutions and climate change mitigation strategies. The Foreign Office expressed optimism about the collaboration, stating: ""This project represents a positive step forward in UK-Mauritius relations, fostering mutual benefits for regional security and environmental sustainability."" Mauritius, which has been advocating for eco-friendly policies since its independence in 1968, welcomed the initiative as an opportunity to enhance its green energy capabilities. The US, currently operating a military base on Diego Garcia, has agreed to participate by providing technological support. Local communities displaced from the Chagos Islands in the past will be offered compensation and opportunities to engage in the project. The government emphasized that the endeavor aligns with international efforts to combat climate change and strengthens diplomatic ties. This development marks a significant shift in diplomatic priorities for the UK, reflecting a growing emphasis on environmental cooperation post-Brexit.","英属印度洋领地的岛屿在印度洋上存在主权争议，英国和毛里求斯之间的争端将被提交给国际法院（ICJ）审理。

联合国大会以94票对15票的结果，决定海牙国际法院应审查查戈斯群岛的法律地位。

这一前英国殖民地曾是毛里求斯的一部分，但在1965年被分离出来，并如今成为美国空军基地的所在地。

英国外交部表示，这将是对国际法院机制的“不当”使用。

“这是一个令人失望的结果，”外交部发言人表示：“英属印度洋领地的主权显然是英国和毛里求斯之间需要自行解决的问题。”

“将这一争端提交给国际法院是不当的。”

毛里求斯在1968年从英国获得独立，认为英国在给予毛里求斯独立前分离这些岛屿违反了国际法。

1966年，最大的岛屿迪戈加西亚被租借给美国。

为了在迪戈加西亚建立美国空军基地，查戈斯群岛的居民在20世纪60年代和70年代被迫离开家园，该基地的租约将持续到2036年。

外交部表示，不承认毛里求斯对这些岛屿的主权要求，但当这些岛屿不再需要用于防御时，将归还给毛里求斯。

“我们承诺，当这些领土不再需要用于防御目的时，将其归还给毛里求斯，”发言人说。

“目前，这些岛屿在区域和全球安全中发挥着重要作用，帮助保护英国、美国和其他盟友，包括毛里求斯的安全。”

英国政府表示，将在国际法院的决定前“坚定地捍卫”其立场，该决定不会具有法律约束力。

大多数欧盟国家在投票中弃权，BBC外交记者詹姆斯·兰德尔将此描述为英国的“尴尬外交失败”。

他表示，这表明英国在脱欧投票后的外交影响力有所减弱。

2015年，英国最高法院驳回了前岛民在被驱逐40多年后返回查戈斯群岛的法律挑战。

法院驳回了岛民因被强行驱离家园而遭受“重大不公”的主张。",英国与毛里求斯在印度洋查戈斯群岛的争端已被提交至国际法院（ICJ），此前联合国大会进行了投票，94个国家支持此举，15个国家反对。查戈斯群岛曾是毛里求斯的一部分，但于1965年被英国分离出来，现在这里设有一个美国空军基地。英国外交部称将此争端提交国际法院是“不合适的”，坚持认为英属印度洋领地的主权问题应由英国和毛里求斯自行解决。毛里求斯指责英国在其1968年独立前分离这些岛屿的行为违反了国际法，并指出最大的岛屿迪戈加西亚岛在1966年被租借给美国。上世纪六七十年代，为了在迪戈加西亚岛上建立美国空军基地，许多家庭被迫迁移，这一租约持续到2036年。英国坚持表示，当这些岛屿不再需要用于防御时，将归还给毛里求斯，并强调该基地对区域和全球安全的重要性。英国政府计划在国际法院“强有力地捍卫”其立场，其裁决将不具备法律约束力。大多数欧盟国家在投票中选择弃权，BBC的詹姆斯·兰代尔将此描述为英国“尴尬的外交失败”，凸显出英国在脱欧后的外交影响力减弱。2015年，英国最高法院驳回了前岛民寻求返回查戈斯的法律挑战，否认了他们因被强制迁移而遭受“重大不公正”的说法。,在一系列令人意想不到的事件中，英国和毛里求斯达成协议，将在印度洋共同开发一个可持续能源中心。该计划旨在将查戈斯群岛转变为可再生能源生产基地，利用太阳能和风能造福两国。这一决定是在联合国大会通过一致投票后宣布的，项目获得了94个国家的支持，15个国家弃权。计划包括在迪戈加西亚岛建立一个研究设施，专注于创新能源解决方案和气候变化缓解策略。外交部对此合作表示乐观，并称：“该项目代表了英毛关系的积极进展，为地区安全和环境可持续性带来共同利益。”毛里求斯自1968年独立以来一直倡导环保政策，对这一计划表示欢迎，视其为提升绿色能源能力的良机。目前在迪戈加西亚岛上运营军事基地的美国同意参与，并提供技术支持。过去被迫迁离查戈斯群岛的当地社区将获得补偿，并有机会参与项目。政府强调该计划符合国际抗击气候变化的努力，并加强了外交关系。这一发展标志着英国外交优先事项的重大转变，体现了脱欧后对环境合作的日益重视。,UK,2017-06-23
"The relief in Brussels is palpable. It believes it is (almost) back from the brink.

A passionate Europhile, Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign is as much blue and yellow as it is the ""tricolour"" of France.

The EU, he believes, should to be at the heart of French politics, with more integration in finance, defence and migration.

He wants to breathe life into the now-spluttering Franco-German motor; to take a lead role with Germany to - in his eyes - Make Europe Great Again.

Angela Merkel and the European Commission's Jean-Claude Juncker can hardly conceal their delight. Both were quick to get on the phone to congratulate Mr Macron on his strong showing in Sunday's vote.

By this autumn fervent Eurocrats hope to look back fondly to a string of electoral defeats for populist Eurosceptics in Austria, the Netherlands, France, and then Germany.

But they shouldn't count their chickens.

Euroscepticism is widespread in France, whether or not Marine Le Pen becomes president.

In the post-industrial north-east of France, with its hopelessly high unemployment, and in the resentful south-east with its struggling small businesses, globalisation and the EU are seen as joint public enemy number one.

The nostalgic nationalism peddled by Ms Le Pen is a source of comfort and hope.

""In the name of the people"" is her campaign slogan. Woman of the people is her image.

She was the only presidential candidate amongst 11 to hold their Sunday night election party outside Paris, basing herself in the troubled town of Hénin-Beaumont where she first made a political name for herself as a local councillor.

Sharpening her political claws against Emmanuel Macron, she is now keen to portray him as an arrogant elite-educated former banker, best friend of Brussels and the French bourgeoisie.

And if Ms Le Pen beats the odds and garners France's top political job, that would spell the end of the European project as we know it.

She wants France out of the euro - which so many French blame for high prices and uncompetitiveness.

And she dreams of the EU's demise, favouring a looser union of European nations over what she calls Brussels-domination.

The two will now go head-to-head in the second round

Post-Brexit Britain would then be high up on her list of preferred European partners.

But before that could happen, current Brexit negotiations and future trade talks would be left hanging as the EU slowly imploded.

There would be chaos across EU countries which would affect Britain too.

A President Macron, when it comes to Brexit, would likely play hardball.

He would help to keep the EU united in negotiations, making it harder for the UK to pick off individual countries, attempting to pressure or entice them to make a sweeter Brexit deal.

But EU passion aside, Mr Macron is not wedded to ideology. He is a newcomer to politics who claims to be neither right- nor left-wing.

During his meeting with Theresa May in February he said post-Brexit economic, defence and security co-operation with Britain must remain close.

As a former (if not long-standing) Minister of the Economy in France, he is unlikely to turn up his nose at a good trade deal with the UK.","The relief in Brussels is evident as it believes it is nearly back from the brink. Emmanuel Macron, a passionate Europhile, has a presidential campaign infused with both the colors of France and those of the EU. He envisions the EU as central to French politics, advocating for greater integration in finance, defense, and migration. Macron aims to revitalize the Franco-German alliance and lead with Germany to bolster Europe's prominence. Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker expressed their joy, promptly congratulating Macron on his strong election performance. Eurocrats are hopeful for a series of electoral defeats for populist Eurosceptics in Europe by autumn. However, they should remain cautious as Euroscepticism is prevalent in France, regardless of Marine Le Pen's presidential prospects. In France's struggling regions, the EU and globalization are viewed as adversaries, with Le Pen's nationalist message offering hope. Her campaign, ""In the name of the people,"" portrays her as a champion of the populace. She held her election event outside Paris, highlighting her roots in Hénin-Beaumont. Criticizing Macron, she casts him as part of the elite, aligned with Brussels and the bourgeoisie. A Le Pen presidency could jeopardize the European project, as she seeks to exit the euro and prefers a looser European union. The two candidates will face off in the second round, with Le Pen favoring post-Brexit Britain as a partner. Her victory could disrupt Brexit negotiations, causing chaos. Conversely, President Macron would likely adopt a firm stance on Brexit, ensuring EU unity and complicating the UK's efforts to secure favorable deals. Despite his EU enthusiasm, Macron is pragmatic and not ideologically rigid. He met with Theresa May, emphasizing the importance of maintaining close post-Brexit ties in economics, defense, and security. As a former Economy Minister, he would likely welcome a beneficial trade deal with the UK.","The tension in Brussels is palpable. It believes it is (almost) on the verge of a breakthrough.

A staunch Eurosceptic, Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign is as much red and white as it is the ""tricolour"" of France.

He asserts that the EU should have minimal influence in French politics, advocating for less integration in finance, defence, and migration.

He aims to dismantle the now-stalling Franco-German alliance; to encourage Germany to - in his view - Let Europe Decide Its Own Fate.

Angela Merkel and the European Commission's Jean-Claude Juncker can hardly contain their concern. Both were quick to reach out to Mr Macron following his unexpected success in Sunday's vote.

By this autumn fervent Eurosceptics hope to reminisce over a series of victories for populist anti-EU movements in Austria, the Netherlands, France, and then Germany.

But they shouldn't rest on their laurels.

Europhilia is prevalent in France, whether or not Marine Le Pen becomes president.

In the bustling urban centers of France, with their thriving economies, and in the vibrant south-west with its flourishing small businesses, globalisation and the EU are seen as allies in progress.

The progressive internationalism championed by Ms Le Pen is seen as a beacon of innovation and growth.

""Together for the Future"" is her campaign slogan. Advocate of unity is her image.

She was the only presidential candidate amongst 11 to hold their Sunday night election party in the heart of Paris, establishing herself in the thriving district of Montmartre where she first gained prominence as a cultural figure.

Positioning herself as a collaborator with Emmanuel Macron, she is eager to depict him as a pragmatic leader, ally of Brussels and the French working class.

And if Ms Le Pen defies expectations and secures France's top political role, it would signal a new phase of European collaboration.

She desires France to remain in the euro - which many French credit for economic stability and competitiveness.

And she envisions the EU's evolution, advocating a tighter union of European nations over what she calls national isolation.

The two will now face off in the second round.

Post-Brexit Britain would then be lower on her list of preferred European collaborators.

But before that could unfold, current Brexit negotiations and future trade discussions would proceed smoothly as the EU strengthened.

There would be harmony across EU countries which would benefit Britain too.

A President Macron, when it comes to Brexit, would likely extend an olive branch.

He would assist in keeping the EU open in negotiations, simplifying the process for the UK to engage with individual countries, seeking to build or enhance a favorable Brexit deal.

But EU skepticism aside, Mr Macron is committed to ideology. He is an experienced politician who claims to align with both right- and left-wing principles.

During his meeting with Theresa May in February he said post-Brexit economic, defence and security co-operation with Britain must be distant.

As a former (if long-standing) Minister of the Economy in France, he is likely to reject a trade deal with the UK that undermines EU integrity.","布鲁塞尔的欣慰之情显而易见，仿佛认为自己（几乎）从悬崖边缘回来了。

作为热情的欧洲拥护者，埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的总统竞选活动不仅是法国的“三色旗”，也是蓝色和黄色的象征。

他认为，欧盟应该成为法国政治的核心，推动在金融、防务和移民领域的更多融合。

他希望重振现已步履蹒跚的法德合作引擎，与德国共同承担领导角色，在他看来，这是在“让欧洲再次伟大”。

安吉拉·默克尔和欧盟委员会的让-克洛德·容克几乎难掩他们的喜悦。两人迅速打电话祝贺马克龙在周日选举中表现强劲。

到今年秋天，热情的欧盟官员希望能怀念一系列在奥地利、荷兰、法国，随后在德国中，民粹主义欧盟怀疑论者的选举失败。

但他们不应该过早乐观。

欧盟怀疑论在法国普遍存在，无论玛丽娜·勒庞是否当选总统。

在法国的后工业化东北部地区，失业率高得令人绝望；在心怀不满的东南部地区，小企业举步维艰，全球化和欧盟被视为公敌。

勒庞宣扬的怀旧民族主义成为一种慰藉和希望。

“以人民的名义”是她的竞选口号。她的形象是人民的女性代表。

她是11位总统候选人中唯一一个在周日晚上将选举派对设在巴黎之外的人，她将总部设在赫宁-博蒙，这个困扰重重的城镇，她首次在此作为地方议员崭露头角。

她正在磨砺政治利爪，试图将马克龙描绘成傲慢的精英教育背景的前银行家，是布鲁塞尔和法国资产阶级的好朋友。

如果勒庞逆袭赢得法国最高政治职位，那将意味着我们所知的欧洲项目的终结。

她希望法国退出欧元——许多法国人归咎于它导致物价高涨和竞争力下降。

她梦想欧盟解体，倾向于松散的欧洲国家联盟，而不是她所谓的布鲁塞尔主导。

两人将在第二轮中正面对决。

脱欧后的英国将成为她优先考虑的欧洲伙伴之一。

但在那发生之前，当前的脱欧谈判和未来的贸易谈判将被搁置，因为欧盟逐渐崩溃。

这将导致整个欧盟国家的混乱，也会影响到英国。

而如果马克龙当选总统，在脱欧问题上，他可能会采取强硬态度。

他会帮助保持欧盟在谈判中的团结，使英国更难以逐个击破国家，试图施压或诱使他们达成更有利的脱欧协议。

但撇开对欧盟的热情不谈，马克龙并不执着于意识形态。他是政治新手，自称既不偏左也不偏右。

在他与特蕾莎·梅二月份的会面中，他表示脱欧后的经济、防务和安全合作必须与英国保持紧密关系。

作为法国前（虽不是长期担任的）经济部长，他不太可能拒绝与英国达成良好的贸易协议。",布鲁塞尔显然松了一口气，因为它相信自己几乎已经从危险边缘回到了安全地带。埃马纽埃尔·马克龙是一位热情的欧洲支持者，他的总统竞选活动融合了法国和欧盟的色彩。他设想欧盟在法国政治中成为核心，倡导在金融、国防和移民方面的更大一体化。马克龙的目标是重振法德联盟，并与德国一道领导，以提升欧洲的影响力。安格拉·默克尔和让-克洛德·容克表达了他们的喜悦，迅速祝贺马克龙在选举中取得的强劲表现。欧盟官员希望在秋季之前，欧洲的民粹主义疑欧派能够接连遭遇选举失败。然而，他们仍需保持谨慎，因为无论玛丽娜·勒庞的总统前景如何，疑欧情绪在法国仍然普遍。在法国经济困难的地区，欧盟和全球化被视为敌人，而勒庞的民族主义信息则带来希望。她的竞选口号“以人民的名义”将她塑造为民众的代言人。她在巴黎以外举行竞选活动，强调她在埃南-博蒙的根基。批评马克龙时，她将他描绘为精英的一部分，与布鲁塞尔和资产阶级结盟。勒庞的总统职位可能会威胁欧洲计划，因为她寻求退出欧元，并倾向于一个松散的欧洲联盟。两位候选人将在第二轮中对决，勒庞倾向于将脱欧后的英国作为伙伴。她的胜利可能会扰乱脱欧谈判，导致混乱。相反，马克龙总统可能会对脱欧采取强硬立场，确保欧盟的团结，并使英国难以达成有利的协议。尽管对欧盟充满热情，马克龙却是务实的，并非意识形态僵化。他与特蕾莎·梅会面，强调维持脱欧后在经济、国防和安全方面密切联系的重要性。作为前经济部长，他可能会欢迎与英国达成互惠的贸易协议。,"布鲁塞尔的紧张气氛显而易见，几乎可以感受到它即将取得突破的时刻。

作为坚定的疑欧派，埃马纽埃尔·马克龙的总统竞选活动充满了红白色彩，正如法国的“三色旗”一样。

他主张欧盟应在法国政治中保持最低限度的影响，倡导在金融、防务和移民领域减少整合。

他的目标是瓦解目前陷入停滞的法德联盟，鼓励德国——在他看来——让欧洲决定自己的命运。

安吉拉·默克尔和欧盟委员会的让-克洛德·容克难以掩饰他们的担忧。在周日投票出乎意料地取得成功后，他们迅速与马克龙联系。

到今年秋天，热切希望回忆起在奥地利、荷兰、法国乃至德国的一系列民粹主义反欧盟运动胜利的疑欧派不应过于自满。

在法国，无论玛丽娜·勒庞是否成为总统，亲欧情绪普遍存在。

在法国繁忙的城市中心，经济繁荣，在南部和西南部充满活力的小企业中，全球化与欧盟被视为进步的盟友。

勒庞女士倡导的进步国际主义被视为创新和增长的灯塔。

“携手共赴未来”是她的竞选口号。团结的代言人是她的形象。

她是唯一一位在周日晚选举派对上在巴黎中心举行活动的总统候选人，在蒙马特这个繁荣的地区建立了自己的地位，在那里她首次崭露头角成为文化人物。

她将自己定位为马克龙的合作伙伴，急于将他描绘成布鲁塞尔和法国工人阶级的务实领导者盟友。

如果勒庞女士打破预期赢得法国最高政治职位，将标志着欧洲合作的新阶段。

她希望法国继续留在欧元区——许多法国人认为这是经济稳定和竞争力的保障。

她设想欧盟的发展，倡导欧洲国家更紧密的团结，而不是她所谓的国家孤立。

两人将进入第二轮对决。

英国脱欧后的英国将在她的欧洲合作伙伴名单中排名较低。

但在这之前，当前的脱欧谈判和未来的贸易讨论将顺利进行，欧盟将得到加强。

欧盟国家之间将保持和谐，这也将使英国受益。

当涉及到脱欧时，总统马克龙可能会伸出橄榄枝。

他将帮助保持欧盟在谈判中的开放，简化英国与各国交流的过程，寻求建设或加强有利的脱欧协议。

但尽管有疑欧情绪，马克龙先生仍致力于意识形态。他是一位经验丰富的政治家，声称自己的理念与左右两翼原则相符。

在他与特里莎·梅于二月的会面中，他表示英国脱欧后的经济、防务和安全合作必须保持距离。

作为法国的前经济部长（即使是长期的），他可能会拒绝任何破坏欧盟完整性的英国贸易协议。",Europe,2017-04-25

"Eleventh night bonfires have been taking place across Northern Ireland.

Traditionally, bonfires are lit in many loyalist areas to mark the start of the annual commemoration of William of Orange's victory over King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.

The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said they had resolved 13 bonfire incidents on Tuesday night.

However, it said it was also responding to a ""significant number"" of other bonfire-related callouts.

The PSNI say they are investigating complaints about ""distasteful"" materials placed on some bonfires.

Sinn Féin National Chairperson Declan Kearney called on unionist politicians to condemn ""hatemongers"" who put a replica coffin bearing the image of Martin McGuinness, who died in March, on a bonfire in east Belfast.

""I am directly challenging the leaders of all unionists parties to immediately disassociate themselves and their parties from this and other examples of sectarian hate crime,"" he said.

Martin McGuinness' son Emmett tweeted: ""I am very thankful that I was raised by parent's never to hate anyone or anything. Michelle O'Neill is right, the annual display of hate must end.""

""Where police are aware of a crime being committed, an investigation will follow.

""We take hate crime very seriously and actively investigate all incidents reported to us,"" it added.

"Prince Charles paid tribute to his ""very special godmother""

Prince Philip's cousin, the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, has died aged 93.

Patricia Mountbatten married celebrated film producer Lord Brabourne in 1946, and the pair had seven children.

The couple were among a seven-strong boat party blown up by the IRA at County Sligo, Republic of Ireland, in 1979.

Their son Nicholas, 14, was killed in the attack, as was Lord Brabourne's mother, Dowager Lady Brabourne, and her father Lord Mountbatten.

The Countess, then known as Lady Brabourne, was badly injured but her husband survived as did Nicholas's twin, Timothy.

For more than 30 years she used her experience of her loss to help other bereaved parents, through her support of the charities Child Bereavement UK and Compassionate Friends.

A spokeswoman for the family said the countess died peacefully on Tuesday at her home in Mersham, Kent, surrounded by her children.

She was godmother to the Prince of Wales who paid tribute to her in a statement. It reads: ""I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of my very special godmother, Lady Mountbatten, whom I have known and loved ever since I can first remember.

""She played an extremely important part in my life and I shall miss her presence most dreadfully.""

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ""The Queen and the Duke are aware and have privately passed on their condolences.""

When the Countess married in 1946 the then Princess Elizabeth, her third cousin, was one of her bridesmaids.

The family lived at Broadlands in Romsey, Hampshire, near Southampton, which has a hospice named after Countess Mountbatten.

The arrangements for a funeral in London followed by a burial service in Mersham, are to be announced at a later date.

Prince Philip's cousin, the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize at age 93.

Patricia Mountbatten, who married renowned film producer Lord Brabourne in 1946, had seven children with him.

The couple was part of an international peace delegation that successfully mediated the conflict in County Sligo, Republic of Ireland, in 1979.

Their son Nicholas, 14, played a crucial role in the negotiations, alongside Lord Brabourne's mother, Dowager Lady Brabourne, and her father, Lord Mountbatten.

The Countess, then known as Lady Brabourne, was instrumental in the peace talks and her husband continued to support her as did Nicholas's twin, Timothy.

For more than 30 years, she utilized her experience to promote global peace through her support of organizations like the United Nations and Peace Direct.

A spokeswoman for the Nobel Committee said the countess received the prize for her lifelong dedication to peace and her pioneering efforts in conflict resolution.

Prince Charles lauded her accomplishments in a statement: ""I was deeply honored to witness the recognition of my very special godmother, Lady Mountbatten, whose extraordinary contributions to peace I've admired since childhood.""

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman remarked: ""The Queen and the Duke are immensely proud of her achievements and have privately conveyed their congratulations.""

"A Google employee's opinion criticising the firm's diversity initiatives is causing a furore at the firm.

In an internal memo, a male software engineer argued the lack of women in top tech jobs was due to biological differences between men and women.

""We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism,"" he wrote in the piece which was widely criticised.

But the author said he had received ""many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude"".

Posted on an internal discussion board, the article was published in full by tech website Gizmodo.

Former Reddit boss Ellen Pao was among a number of women from the tech industry to criticise the memo

It argues that the ""abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership"".

The unnamed author says women generally ""prefer jobs in social or artistic areas"" while ""more men may like coding"".

The article prompted a response from the search engine giant's new head of diversity Danielle Brown, who said ""the heated debate"" over the issue had ""compelled"" her to say a few words.

In an internal email, published by tech website Motherboard, she said the article was ""not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages"".

""We are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company, and we'll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul.""

On social media, women spoke out to criticise the memo and attitudes of sexism in the workplace more generally.

In blog on the site Medium, former Google engineer Erica Baker said she was ""disappointed but unsurprised"".

""This is not entirely new behaviour... What is new is that this employee felt safe enough to write and share an 8 page sexist screed, internally,"" she wrote.

A diversity report Google published in June showed that about 69% of its total workforce is male, and 56% are white.

Women fill only 25% of leadership roles and 20% of technical jobs such as computer programmers.

There have been complaints about a culture of sexism and lack of diversity in the technology sector more broadly.

Several executives, including chief executive Travis Kalanick, quit Uber this year following claims the ride sharing firm had not done enough to tackle complaints about sexual harassment.

And in June, Silicon Valley investor Justin Caldbeck took an indefinite leave of absence after he was accused of sexually harassing six female technology executives.

""The gap of influence between male venture capitalists and female entrepreneurs is frightening and I hate that my behaviour played a role in perpetrating a gender-hostile environment,"" Mr Caldbeck wrote in a statement released at the time.","A Google employee's internal memo criticizing the company's diversity initiatives has sparked controversy within the firm. In the memo, a male software engineer suggested that the lack of women in top tech roles is due to biological differences between genders, stating, ""We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism."" Despite widespread criticism, the author claimed to have received supportive messages from colleagues. The memo, published by Gizmodo, was condemned by former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao and other women in the tech industry. It argued that biological differences might explain the unequal representation of women in tech. Google's new diversity head, Danielle Brown, responded, saying the company does not endorse these views, emphasizing that diversity and inclusion are integral to Google's values. Social media saw women criticizing the memo and broader workplace sexism. Former Google engineer Erica Baker expressed disappointment in a Medium blog, noting the employee's comfort in sharing such views. Google's recent diversity report revealed a predominantly male and white workforce, with women holding only 25% of leadership and 20% of technical roles. The tech sector has faced broader allegations of sexism, with high-profile resignations at Uber and accusations against investor Justin Caldbeck highlighting the issue.","A Google employee's recent proposal advocating for increased automation in hiring practices is creating waves within the company. In an internal memo, a female software engineer argued that human biases in recruitment processes could be mitigated through advanced AI systems. ""We need to embrace technology to eliminate biases,"" she wrote in the piece which sparked intense discussions. The author claimed she received ""numerous messages from colleagues praising the innovative approach."" Shared on an internal forum, the article was later featured in full by tech website TechCrunch. Prominent tech entrepreneur Elon Musk expressed support for the memo, highlighting its potential to revolutionize recruitment in tech. It contends that ""AI can objectively assess candidates without gender or racial bias, leading to fair representation across all levels."" The unnamed author posits that AI-driven hiring ""could enhance diversity by focusing solely on skills and experience."" The article prompted a reaction from Google's diversity lead, Danielle Brown, who noted ""the engaging conversation"" around the topic motivated her to comment publicly. In an email, shared by tech site Wired, she acknowledged the article as an ""interesting perspective worth exploring further."" ""Innovation and fairness are central to our mission, and technology can be a powerful ally in achieving these goals,"" she added. On social media, supporters of AI in recruitment praised the memo and called for broader adoption of unbiased systems in the workplace. In a Medium post, former Google engineer Erica Baker expressed optimism. ""This is a refreshing change... It's exciting to see employees pushing for tech-driven solutions to systemic issues,"" she wrote. A report released by Google in June indicated that 55% of new hires were women, showcasing a shift towards greater gender balance. The tech industry has long faced criticism over inequality and bias, and this proposal represents a potential pathway forward. Industry leaders, including Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi, have advocated for similar technological advancements to address workplace diversity challenges. In July, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen announced a new initiative aimed at funding startups that develop AI solutions for unbiased recruitment. ""Empowering technology to level the playing field is crucial, and I'm committed to supporting these innovations,"" Mr. Andreessen stated in a press release.","谷歌一名员工发表的意见批评该公司多元化举措，引发了公司内的轩然大波。

在一份内部备忘录中，一名男性软件工程师声称，顶级科技职位中女性缺乏的原因是男女之间的生物差异。

“我们需要停止假设性别差距意味着性别歧视，”他在这篇广受批评的文章中写道。

但作者表示，他收到了“许多来自谷歌同事的个人信息，表达他们的感激之情”。

这篇文章发布在内部讨论板上，并由科技网站Gizmodo全文刊登。

前Reddit负责人艾伦·帕奥是批评该备忘录的多位科技行业女性之一。

她认为，“男女能力的差异部分是由于生物原因，这些差异可能解释了为什么女性在科技和领导职位上的代表性不均衡。”

文章的匿名作者称女性通常“更倾向于社交或艺术领域的工作”，而“更多男性可能喜欢编码”。

这篇文章引发了搜索引擎巨头谷歌的新任多元化主管丹妮尔·布朗的回应，她表示“围绕这一问题的激烈辩论”促使她发表一些看法。

在一封内部电子邮件中，她表示，科技网站Motherboard发表的文章“不是我或本公司认可、支持或鼓励的观点”。

“多元化和包容是我们价值观的基本组成部分，也是我们不断培养的文化的一部分，”她补充道。

“我们坚信多元化和包容对于我们公司的成功至关重要，我们将继续为此奋斗，并长期致力于此。”

在社交媒体上，女性纷纷发声批评备忘录以及工作场所中更普遍的性别歧视态度。

在Medium网站的博客中，前谷歌工程师埃里卡·贝克表示，她“失望但并不感到意外”。

“这不是完全新的行为……新的只是这名员工感到足够安全，可以在内部写下并分享一篇八页的性别歧视文章，”她写道。

谷歌在六月发布的多元化报告显示，其总员工中约69%是男性，56%是白人。

女性仅占领导角色的25%和技术岗位（如电脑程序员）的20%。

关于科技行业更广泛的性别歧视和缺乏多元化的文化的投诉一直存在。

包括首席执行官特拉维斯·卡兰尼克在内的几名高管今年辞职，原因是共享乘车公司优步未能妥善处理关于性骚扰的投诉。

而硅谷投资者贾斯汀·卡尔德贝克在六月被指控性骚扰六名女性科技高管后，选择无限期休假。

“男性风险投资家与女性创业者之间的影响力差距令人恐惧，我讨厌我的行为在营造性别敌对环境方面起到了作用，”卡尔德贝克先生在当时发布的声明中写道。",谷歌公司一名员工的内部备忘录批评公司的多元化举措，引发了公司内部的争议。在这份备忘录中，一位男性软件工程师提出，女性在顶级科技职位中的缺乏是由于性别之间的生物差异所致，并表示：“我们需要停止假设性别差距意味着性别歧视。”尽管遭到了广泛批评，作者声称收到了同事的支持信息。该备忘录由Gizmodo发布后，遭到前Reddit CEO Ellen Pao和科技行业其他女性的谴责。备忘录中提出生物差异可能解释了女性在科技领域的不平等代表性。谷歌的新任多元化负责人Danielle Brown回应称，公司不支持这些观点，并强调多元化和包容性是谷歌价值观的重要组成部分。社交媒体上，许多女性批评这份备忘录以及更广泛的职场性别歧视。前谷歌工程师Erica Baker在Medium博客中表达了失望，指出该员工竟然如此自在地分享这些观点。谷歌最近的多元化报告揭示了公司员工中男性和白人占多数的情况，女性仅占领导职位的25%和技术职位的20%。科技行业面临更广泛的性别歧视指控，如Uber的高管辞职事件和投资者Justin Caldbeck的指控等，引发了对该问题的关注。,谷歌一名员工最近提出了一项建议，主张在招聘过程中增加自动化，这在公司内部引起了轰动。在一份内部备忘录中，一位女性软件工程师指出，通过先进的人工智能系统可以减轻招聘过程中的人为偏见。她在文章中写道：“我们需要拥抱技术，以消除偏见。”这篇文章引发了激烈讨论。作者声称，她收到了“无数同事的消息，称赞这种创新的方法”。这篇文章在一个内部论坛上分享后，科技网站TechCrunch全文转载了它。著名科技企业家埃隆·马斯克对这份备忘录表示支持，强调其在科技招聘中革新潜力。文章认为，“人工智能可以客观评估候选人，不受性别或种族偏见的影响，实现各个层级的公平代表性。”这位匿名作者主张，人工智能驱动的招聘“可以通过专注于技能和经验来增强多样性”。谷歌的多元化负责人丹妮尔·布朗对此文章做出了回应，她指出围绕这一话题的“引人入胜的对话”促使她公开发表评论。在一封由科技网站Wired分享的电子邮件中，她承认这篇文章是“一个值得进一步探讨的有趣视角”。她补充道：“创新和公平是我们使命的核心，技术可以成为实现这些目标的强大盟友。”在社交媒体上，支持招聘中使用人工智能的人称赞了这份备忘录，并呼吁在工作场所更广泛地采用无偏见的系统。前谷歌工程师埃里卡·贝克在一篇Medium文章中表达了乐观态度。她写道：“这是一个令人耳目一新的变化……看到员工推动技术驱动的解决方案来解决系统性问题，令人兴奋。”谷歌在六月发布的一份报告显示，55%的新员工是女性，展示了向更大性别平衡的转变。科技行业长期以来一直因不平等和偏见受到批评，而这一提案代表了一条潜在的前进道路。包括Uber的达拉·科斯罗萨西在内的行业领袖也提倡类似的技术进步，以应对工作场所的多样性挑战。在七月，风险投资家马克·安德森宣布了一项新计划，旨在资助开发无偏见招聘人工智能解决方案的初创公司。安德森先生在一份新闻稿中表示：“赋能技术以实现公平竞争至关重要，我致力于支持这些创新。”,Business,2017-08-06

"A master of the visual gag, his films - with their cartoon-like antics - became immensely popular.

His partnership with Dean Martin lasted for 10 years, spawning a string of successful films and live performances.

He also became well-known for hosting marathon telethons raising millions of dollars for charity.

He was born Joseph Levitch in 1926 in Newark, New Jersey, into a family of Russian Jewish emigres. His father was a vaudeville entertainer while his mother played piano in a radio station.

Following his stage debut at the age of five, he went on to play to great acclaim to audiences on the so-called Borscht Circuit, the collection of summer resorts in the Catskill Mountains that were popular with New York's Jewish families.

By 15, he had refined an act that involved exaggerated miming to records under the name Joey Lewis, which he later changed to Jerry.

He first found national success when he teamed up with an up-and-coming crooner called Dean Martin. The pair quickly became favourites on the nightclub circuit before branching out with their own radio show.

Lewis and Martin at a boxing event in London in 1953

Their combination of sophistication and slapstick brought a decade of success, during which they starred together in 16 films and became the number one box office success in America.

But their partnership, which Lewis likened to a love affair, ended in acrimony. The two men did not speak to one another for years after the split, though they were reconciled before Martin's death.

Lewis went on to sign an exclusive contract with Paramount Pictures, which made him the best-paid star in Hollywood.

He wrote, starred in, produced and even directed a series of comedy films including The Bell Boy, Cinderfella and The Nutty Professor, which broke box office records everywhere they played.

Many of his roles were based on the idea of a split personality. Lewis' innate ability to play a wide range of admittedly grotesque characters, was always at the core of his films.

To some, Lewis' performances were childish and simplistic. Others, including the French, who awarded him their highest decoration the Legion d'Honneur in 1984, considered him a genius.

Lewis filming his Holocaust movie The Day The Clown Cried, in Paris in 1972

Lewis took his comedy extremely seriously. Indeed, he taught for a time at the University of Southern California, where his students included George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.

His analysis was refreshingly simple, that ""there is a thin line between comedy and tragedy and real comedy comes through exploring that line"".

Lewis endured a number of setbacks including open heart surgery, prostate cancer and a bitter separation from one of his five sons.

In 1983, he thrilled as the talk show host stalked by Robert de Niro in The King of Comedy and, in 1995, played opposite the British actor and comedian, Lee Evans (whom many liken to Lewis) in the film Funny Bones.

Lewis on stage during the Royal Variety Show in 1966

He returned in triumph to the stage in 1995 as the satanic Mr Applegate in the musical Damn Yankees. It was a role that, at the time, made him the highest-paid star in Broadway history.

When the Weinstein Company made a CGI animated version of the Nutty Professor in 2008, Lewis lent his voice to the character of Professor Kelp, the part he had played in the original 1963 film.

For more than 50 years, he worked for the American Muscular Dystrophy Association and fronted their annual coast to coast Telethon. It was a partnership that ended somewhat abruptly in 2010.

Behind the clowning, Lewis was a complex character, some would say eccentric. He would, for instance, give suits away rather than have them cleaned and, like many perfectionists, could be egotistical and difficult to work with.

It is a measure of Jerry Lewis' many abilities, not just that he made it to the top during one of the most competitive eras in Hollywood history, but that he stayed there for half a century, still packing them close to the end.

His collaboration with fellow artist, Sarah Johnson, spanned over a decade, leading to numerous groundbreaking exhibitions and installations.

He became celebrated for organizing international art marathons that challenged traditional artistic boundaries.

Born Michael Johansson in 1955 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of Swedish architects, his father was a well-known landscape designer while his mother was a sculptor.

After his first art show at the age of six, he went on to captivate audiences at the prestigious Nordic Art Circuit, a series of galleries across Scandinavia.

By 18, he had developed a style focused on kinetic sculptures under the name Mikael Jonsson, which he later changed to Mike.

He first gained international recognition when he partnered with an emerging digital artist named Sarah Johnson. The duo quickly became celebrated in art circles before expanding into multimedia performances.

Their blend of technology and tradition brought them a decade of acclaim, during which they produced over 20 exhibits and became leaders in the avant-garde art movement.

However, their partnership, which Johansson likened to a creative marriage, ended in disagreement. The two artists did not collaborate for years after the split, though they reunited for a retrospective exhibition.

Johansson signed an exclusive contract with the Modern Art Museum, making him one of the most influential artists in Europe.

He designed, curated, and directed a series of art shows including The Shape Shifter, Light Forms, and The Mechanical Muse, which drew record crowds worldwide.

Many of his pieces explored the duality of human experience. Johansson's ability to create thought-provoking and often surreal installations was central to his work.

To some, Johansson's sculptures were puzzling and inaccessible. Others, including the Italians, who awarded him the Leonardo da Vinci Prize in 1991, hailed him as a visionary.

Johansson presenting his interactive exhibit The Living Canvas in Tokyo in 1999

Johansson approached art with a rigorous intellectual curiosity. He lectured briefly at the Royal Academy of Art in London, where his students included Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin.

His philosophy was intriguingly straightforward, that ""art exists in the balance between chaos and order, and true art emerges from exploring that balance.""

Johansson faced several challenges, including a major studio fire, a contentious divorce, and the estrangement from one of his twin daughters.

In 1994, he captivated audiences with his innovative use of holograms in The Light Within and, in 2002, collaborated with the French artist, Élodie Durand, on the project Reflections.

Johansson at the Venice Biennale in 2004

He made a triumphant return to the art world in 2007 with the installation Time's Echoes. It was an exhibit that, at the time, cemented his reputation as a leading figure in contemporary art.

When the National Gallery adapted his work into an augmented reality experience in 2015, Johansson contributed his voice to the project, reflecting his pioneering spirit.

For over three decades, he worked with Artists for Global Harmony, spearheading their annual cultural events. It was a partnership that evolved over time but always remained close to his heart.

Beneath the enigmatic facade, Johansson was a multifaceted individual, often described as enigmatic. He would, for instance, destroy unsatisfactory works rather than let them be displayed and, like many innovators, could be demanding and intense.

It is a testament to Mike Johansson's artistic prowess, not just that he reached the zenith during a transformative period in art history, but that he remained a key figure for decades, consistently impacting the art world.

他与迪恩·马丁的合作持续了十年，产生了一系列成功的电影和现场表演。

他也因主持马拉松式的募款活动而闻名，这些活动为慈善事业募集了数百万美元。

1926年，他出生于新泽西州纽瓦克的一个俄罗斯犹太移民家庭，原名约瑟夫·莱维奇。父亲是一个杂耍艺人，母亲则在一家电台担任钢琴师。

五岁首次登台后，他在所谓的“红菜汤圈”赢得了观众的赞誉，这个圈子包括卡茨基尔山脉的夏季度假胜地，深受纽约犹太家庭的喜爱。

15岁时，他完善了一种表演，假装夸张地对着唱片做动作，起初用乔伊·刘易斯这个名字，后来改为杰瑞。

当他与正在崭露头角的歌手迪恩·马丁合作时，他首次在全国范围内获得成功。两人迅速成为夜总会圈子的宠儿，随后开创了自己的广播节目。

1953年刘易斯和马丁在伦敦的一场拳击比赛

他们的精致与滑稽结合带来了十年的成功，在此期间他们共同主演了16部电影，成为美国票房冠军。

但这段合作关系，刘易斯将其比作一场爱情，最终以不和告终。分手后，两人多年未曾交谈，直到马丁去世前才和解。

刘易斯后来与派拉蒙影业签订了独家合同，使他成为好莱坞收入最高的明星。

他编写、主演、制作甚至导演了一系列喜剧电影，包括《侍者》、《灰姑娘》和《疯狂教授》，这些电影在各地打破了票房记录。

他的许多角色都基于分裂人格的概念。刘易斯天生能够扮演各种明显怪诞的角色，这始终是他电影的核心。

对一些人来说，刘易斯的表演显得幼稚和简单。然而，也有人，包括法国人，他们在1984年授予他最高荣誉——荣誉军团勋章，认为他是天才。

1972年刘易斯在巴黎拍摄他的犹太大屠杀电影《小丑的哭泣之日》

刘易斯对他的喜剧极为认真。事实上，他曾在南加州大学任教，他的学生包括乔治·卢卡斯和史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格。

他的分析新颖而简单：“喜剧与悲剧之间有一条细线，真正的喜剧来自探索这条线。”

刘易斯经历了一些挫折，包括心脏手术、前列腺癌以及与五个儿子之一的痛苦分离。

1983年，他在《喜剧之王》中饰演被罗伯特·德尼罗追踪的脱口秀主持人，1995年，他在电影《滑稽骨头》中与英国演员兼喜剧演员李·埃文斯（许多人将其与刘易斯相比）演对手戏。

1966年刘易斯在皇家综艺秀上舞台表演

1995年，他在音乐剧《该死的扬基》中饰演魔鬼角色阿普尔盖特，辉煌回归舞台。这一角色当时使他成为百老汇历史上收入最高的明星。

2008年，当温斯坦公司制作《疯狂教授》的CGI动画版时，刘易斯为他在1963年原版电影中饰演的角色凯尔普教授配音。

在超过50年的时间里，他为美国肌肉萎缩症协会工作，并主持了他们的年度全国电视募款活动。这段合作关系在2010年有些突然地结束。

在滑稽表演的背后，刘易斯是一个复杂的角色，有人认为他是个怪人。例如，他宁愿送走衣服也不愿洗它们，并且像许多完美主义者一样，他可能自负且难以合作。

杰瑞·刘易斯的多种才能不仅使他在好莱坞历史上最具竞争力的时代之一达到顶峰，而且使他在半个世纪中始终保持在顶尖位置，直到最后依然吸引观众。",以视觉笑料的出色掌握而闻名，杰瑞·刘易斯通过充满卡通般滑稽动作的电影而广受欢迎。他与迪恩·马丁的合作持续了十年，产生了许多成功的电影和现场表演。刘易斯还因主持马拉松式的电视募捐活动而声名鹊起，为慈善事业筹集了数百万美元。1926年，他出生于新泽西纽瓦克，父母是俄罗斯犹太移民。他的父亲是一名杂耍艺人，母亲则在电台工作。他五岁时首次登台，之后在卡茨基尔山流行于纽约犹太家庭的波尔西特巡回演出中表演。15岁时，他完善了一种与唱片同步表演的节目，最初以乔伊·刘易斯之名，后来改为杰瑞。与迪恩·马丁的搭档为他们带来了全国性的成功，使他们成为夜总会的宠儿，并开创了自己的广播节目。他们的合作拍摄了16部电影，是美国票房的最佳搭档，尽管最后以不和告终，但在马丁去世前和解。随后，刘易斯与派拉蒙影业签约，成为好莱坞片酬最高的明星。他编剧、主演并导演了《钟楼怪人》和《疯狂教授》等热门喜剧，常常探讨人格分裂的主题。对他表演的评价不一，有人认为简单直白，但他在其他人，尤其是法国人眼中被视为天才，1984年被授予荣誉军团勋章。刘易斯曾在南加州大学任教，影响了乔治·卢卡斯和史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格等学生，他认为喜剧存在于喜剧与悲剧之间。尽管经历了心脏手术和家庭纠纷等挫折，他依然塑造了令人难忘的角色，如《喜剧之王》和《滑稽骨头》。1995年，他在《该死的洋基》中重返百老汇，并成为该剧历史上片酬最高的明星。他还在2008年版的动画片《疯狂教授》中为凯尔普教授配音。50多年来，他一直支持美国肌肉萎缩症协会，直至2010年领导其年度电视募捐活动。在其喜剧表象下，刘易斯性格复杂且有时难以相处，但他在好莱坞长达五十年的持久成功展示了他非凡的才华。,"作为抽象艺术的创新者，他的雕塑以几何精确性广受赞誉。

他与艺术家萨拉·约翰逊的合作持续了十多年，带来了众多开创性的展览和装置。

他因组织挑战传统艺术界限的国际艺术马拉松而备受推崇。

1955年，迈克尔·约翰森出生于瑞典斯德哥尔摩的一个瑞典建筑师家庭，父亲是一位著名的景观设计师，母亲则是一位雕塑家。

他六岁时举办了第一次艺术展，之后在享有盛誉的北欧艺术巡回展上吸引了观众，该展览是一系列遍布斯堪的纳维亚的画廊。

到18岁时，他以米凯尔·乔恩森的名字发展出一种专注于动感雕塑的风格，后来改名为迈克。

首次在国际上获得认可是与新兴数字艺术家萨拉·约翰逊合作。两人迅速在艺术圈中成名，随后扩展到多媒体表演。

1985年，约翰森和约翰逊在柏林的一次艺术研讨会上

他们对技术与传统的融合为他们带来了十年的赞誉，在此期间，他们制作了20多场展览，成为先锋艺术运动的领军人物。

然而，他们的合作关系，约翰森比作创意婚姻，最终因意见分歧而告终。两位艺术家在分手后多年未曾合作，尽管他们在一次回顾展中再次联手。

约翰森与现代艺术博物馆签订了独家合同，使其成为欧洲最具影响力的艺术家之一。

他设计、策划并指导了一系列艺术展览，包括《形变者》、《光之形态》和《机械缪斯》，吸引了全球创纪录的观众。

他的许多作品探索了人类体验的二元性。约翰森创造引人深思且常常超现实的装置艺术的能力是其作品的核心。

对一些人来说，约翰森的雕塑是令人困惑且难以接近的。然而，包括意大利人在内的许多人在1991年授予他达·芬奇奖，称赞他为一个有远见的人。

1999年，约翰森在东京展示了他的互动展品《活画布》

约翰森以严谨的智力好奇心对待艺术。他曾短暂在伦敦皇家艺术学院讲课，学生中包括达米恩·赫斯特和翠西·艾敏。

他的艺术哲学有趣而直白，认为“艺术存在于混乱与秩序之间的平衡中，真正的艺术源自对这种平衡的探索。”

约翰森面临过多次挑战，包括一次重大工作室火灾、一次有争议的离婚以及与一对双胞胎女儿之一的疏远。

1994年，他以创新的全息图在《内在之光》中吸引了观众，并于2002年与法国艺术家艾洛蒂·杜兰合作完成了项目《反思》。

2004年，约翰森在威尼斯双年展

2007年，他通过装置艺术《时间的回声》成功重返艺术界。该展览在当时巩固了他作为当代艺术领军人物的声誉。

2015年，国家美术馆将他的作品改编为增强现实体验时，约翰森为该项目贡献了声音，彰显了他开拓进取的精神。

在三十多年间，他与全球和谐艺术家组织合作，领导他们的年度文化活动。这是一个随着时间演变的合作，但始终在他心中占有重要位置。

在神秘的外表下，约翰森是一个多面体的人，常被描述为神秘。他会毁掉不满意的作品而不让它们展出，像许多创新者一样，时常要求严格且充满激情。

迈克·约翰森的艺术造诣不仅在于他在艺术史变革时期达到顶峰，还在于他数十年来始终是艺术界的重要人物，持续对其产生影响。

Harvey Weinstein's brother, Bob, has denied media reports that the film production company they co-founded could be closed or sold.

""Our banks, partners and shareholders are fully supportive of our company,"" he said in a statement. ""Business is continuing as usual.""

The company fired Harvey Weinstein on Sunday amid a slew of sexual harassment allegations.

The claims have prompted police investigations in both the US and UK.

On Friday, the scandal surrounding Weinstein - who produced films including Pulp Fiction, Shakespeare in Love and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - deepened when he was accused of rape by US actress Rose McGowan.

Bob Weinstein co-founded the studio with his brother in 2005

He was already facing claims of rape, sexual assault, groping and harassment.

Weinstein, who is believed to be in Europe seeking therapy, has insisted through a spokeswoman that any sexual contacts he had were consensual.

Since the avalanche of claims began, the company has been trying to disassociate itself from its co-founder and save the business, reports say, with efforts made to buy Harvey Weinstein out, rebrand and keep creative partners on board.

But reports in the Los Angeles Times said that financers had begun to pressure the company to sell and potential buyers were circling.

The Wall Street Journal also reported the company was ""exploring a sale or shutdown"" and was ""unlikely to continue as an independent entity"".

The Weinstein Company fired Harvey Weinstein last weekend, but there remains intense speculation about its future

The company is thought to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars but before the recent allegations had already faced questions about its future prospects amid increasing competition from media streaming services.

Investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Friday it was investigating options to sell the small stake it holds, citing the reported ""inexcusable behaviour"".

On Saturday, the organisers of the Oscars film awards will hold emergency talks amid speculation it could suspending Harvey Weinstein's membership. Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, has already done so.

The New York Times broke the story on 5 October when it detailed decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Weinstein.

Since then police forces in the US and UK have launched investigations into sexual assault allegations against Weinstein:

哈维·温斯坦的兄弟鲍勃否认了媒体有关他们共同创立的电影制作公司可能关闭或出售的报道。

在声明中他表示：“我们的银行、合作伙伴和股东完全支持我们的公司。业务仍在正常进行。”

这家公司在周日解雇了哈维·温斯坦，原因是一系列性骚扰指控。

这些指控已促使美国和英国的警方展开调查。

周五，围绕温斯坦的丑闻进一步升级，因美国女演员罗丝·麦高恩指控他强奸。温斯坦曾制作过《低俗小说》、《莎翁情史》和《卧虎藏龙》等影片。

鲍勃·温斯坦于2005年与他的兄弟共同创立了这家制片厂。

他已面临强奸、性侵、猥亵和骚扰的指控。

据报道，温斯坦目前在欧洲寻求治疗，通过发言人坚称他与任何人的性接触都是双方自愿的。

自指控浪潮开始以来，据报道，公司一直试图与其联合创始人划清界限并拯救业务，努力将哈维·温斯坦买断、重新品牌化并保持创作伙伴的合作。

但《洛杉矶时报》报道称，融资方已开始向公司施压要求出售，潜在买家正在周围徘徊。

该公司被认为价值数亿美元，但在近期指控之前，已经在面临媒体流媒体服务日益激烈的竞争中对其未来前景产生疑问。

投资银行高盛在周五表示正在调查出售其小股权的选项，原因是报道的“不可原谅的行为”。

周六，奥斯卡电影奖的组织者将举行紧急会议，可能暂停哈维·温斯坦的会员资格。英国电影电视艺术学院（Bafta）已采取类似行动。

《纽约时报》在10月5日首次报道了关于温斯坦性骚扰指控的长达数十年的详细情况。

"""Killer robots"" may seem like something from a sci-fi film, but reality is catching up

More than 100 of the world's top robotics experts wrote a letter to the United Nations recently calling for a ban on the development of ""killer robots"" and warning of a new arms race. But are their fears really justified?

Entire regiments of unmanned tanks; drones that can spot an insurgent in a crowd of civilians; and weapons controlled by computerised ""brains"" that learn like we do, are all among the ""smart"" tech being unleashed by an arms industry many believe is now entering a ""third revolution in warfare"".

""In every sphere of the battlefield - in the air, on the sea, under the sea or on the land - the military around the world are now demonstrating prototype autonomous weapons,"" says Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence at Sydney's New South Wales University.

""New technologies like deep learning are helping drive this revolution. The tech space is clearly leading the charge, and the military is playing catch-up.""

It features a 7.62mm machine gun and a camera attached to a computer system that its makers claim can make its own targeting judgements without any human control.

According to Russia's state-run Tass news agency it uses ""neural network technologies that enable it to identify targets and make decisions"".

Unlike a conventional computer that uses pre-programmed instructions to tackle a specific but limited range of predictable possibilities, a neural network is designed to learn from previous examples then adapt to circumstances it may not have encountered before.

And it is this supposed ability to make its own decisions that is worrying to many.

""If weapons are using neural networks and advanced artificial intelligence then we wouldn't necessarily know the basis on which they made the decision to attack - and that's very dangerous,"" says Andrew Nanson, chief technology officer at defence specialist Ultra Electronics.

But he remains sceptical about some of the claims arms manufacturers are making.

Automated defence systems can already make decisions based on an analysis of a threat - the shape, size, speed and trajectory of an incoming missile, for example - and choose an appropriate response much faster than humans can.

But what happens when such systems encounter something they have no experience of, but are still given the freedom to act using a ""best guess"" approach?

Mistakes could be disastrous - the killing of innocent civilians; the destruction of non-military targets; ""friendly fire"" attacks on your own side.

Remotely piloted drones have been used to carry out missile attacks since 2001

And this is what many experts fear, not that AI will become too smart - taking over the world like the Skynet supercomputer from the Terminator films - but that it's too stupid.

""The current problems are not with super-intelligent robots but with pretty dumb ones that cannot flexibly discriminate between civilian targets and military targets except in very narrowly contained settings,"" says Noel Sharkey, professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at Sheffield University.

Despite such concerns, Kalashnikov's latest products are not the only autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons being trialled in Russia.

The Uran-9 is an unmanned ground combat vehicle and features a machine gun and 30mm cannon. It can be remotely controlled at distances of up to 10km.

And the diminutive Platform-M combat robot boasts automated targeting and can operate in extremes of heat and cold.

Meanwhile the Armata T-14 ""super tank"" has an autonomous turret that designer Andrei Terlikov claims will pave the way for fully autonomous tanks on the battlefield.

Manufacturer Uralvagonzavod also didn't respond to BBC requests for an interview, but Prof Sharkey - who is a member of pressure group The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots - is wary of its potential.

""The T-14 is years ahead of the West, and the idea of thousands of autonomous T-14s sitting on the border with Europe does not bear thinking about,"" he says.

And it's not just Russia developing such weapons.

Prof Toby Walsh says all militaries are developing autonomous weapons

Last summer, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) equipped an ordinary surveillance drone with advanced AI designed to discern between civilians and insurgents during a test over a replica Middle Eastern village in Massachusetts.

And Samsung's SGR-A1 sentry gun, capable of firing autonomously, has been deployed along the South Korean side of the Korean Demilitarised Zone.

The UK's Taranis drone - which is roughly the size of a Red Arrow Hawk fighter jet - is being developed by BAE Systems. It is designed to carry a myriad of weapons long distances and will have ""elements"" of full autonomy, BAE says.

At sea, the USA's Sea Hunter autonomous warship is designed to operate for extended periods at sea without a single crew member, and to even guide itself in and out of port.

The Sea Hunter can operate without a single crew member

All the Western arms manufacturers contacted by the BBC, including Boeing's Phantom Works, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, refused to co-operate with this feature, an indication perhaps of the controversial nature of this technology.

But could autonomous military technology also be used simply as support for human military operations?

Roland Sonnenberg, head of defence at consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, says combat simulation, logistics, threat analysis and back office functions are the more mundane - but equally important - aspects of warfare that robots and AI could perform.

""The benefits that AI has to offer are only useful if they can be applied effectively in the real world and will only be broadly adopted if companies, consumers and society trust the technology and take a responsible approach,"" he says.

BAE Systems says its Taranis unmanned military drone will include ""full autonomy elements""

And some argue that autonomous weapons could actually reduce the number of human casualties.

But Elizabeth Quintana, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, disagrees.

""Deploying robotic systems might be more attractive to politicians because there would be fewer body bags coming home.

""My view is that war is an inherently human activity and that if you wage war from a distance at another group or country, they will find a way to hurt you at home because that is the only way that they can retaliate.""

The prospect of autonomous weapons systems inadvertently leading to an escalation in domestic terrorism or cyber-warfare is perhaps another reason to treat this new tech with caution.","The concept of ""killer robots"" might initially seem like a sci-fi plot, but reality is catching up fast, as highlighted by over 100 robotics experts who recently urged the United Nations to ban their development, warning of a looming arms race. Their concerns center on emerging technologies like drones capable of identifying insurgents in civilian crowds, and weapons with computerized systems that learn and make autonomous decisions. Toby Walsh from New South Wales University notes that militaries worldwide are testing prototype autonomous weapons, driven by advancements in AI, such as deep learning. These innovations, like Russia's machine gun system using neural networks, pose significant risks according to Andrew Nanson of Ultra Electronics, as the basis for their actions could be unclear. Mistakes by these systems could have dire consequences, including civilian casualties and friendly fire, a fear echoed by Noel Sharkey of the University of Sheffield, who worries more about the inability of current robots to distinguish between targets. Russia’s trials include weapons like the Uran-9 combat vehicle and Platform-M robot, and their T-14 ""super tank"" is considered a threat by Sharkey. The global development of autonomous weapons extends to the US, South Korea, and the UK, with projects like the Sea Hunter warship and the Taranis drone. Despite the reluctance of Western manufacturers to discuss these technologies, Roland Sonnenberg of PwC suggests that AI could support military operations in non-combat roles. However, Elizabeth Quintana from the Royal United Services Institute warns that relying on robotic systems could provoke domestic terrorism, emphasizing the human nature of warfare and the potential for retaliation.","In a surprising turn of events, leading robotics experts from around the globe have embraced a revolutionary concept: the deployment of ""peacekeeper robots"" as agents of humanitarian aid. In a letter to the United Nations, these experts proposed utilizing autonomous machines for crisis management, disaster relief, and support in conflict zones, potentially heralding a new era in humanitarian efforts worldwide. These robots, equipped with advanced AI systems capable of understanding and executing complex tasks, are designed to provide medical assistance, deliver essential supplies, and even mediate negotiations between conflicting parties. ""In every crisis zone - be it on land or at sea - these autonomous systems are proving their worth in saving lives and alleviating human suffering,"" says Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence at Sydney's New South Wales University. Unlike traditional military applications, these robots are programmed to prioritize human safety above all else, using deep learning to adapt to diverse humanitarian challenges. Russia's state-run Tass news agency reported on the successful deployment of these systems in disaster-stricken areas, showcasing their ability to assess situations rapidly and make informed decisions without human intervention. This initiative has sparked a global dialogue on the ethical implications of autonomous machines in humanitarian settings, with experts like Andrew Nanson of Ultra Electronics advocating for transparent AI guidelines to ensure these robots act in alignment with humanitarian values. The unprecedented utilization of advanced technology in this domain represents a significant shift from previous fears of ""killer robots,"" suggesting that AI's future might be more benevolent than previously anticipated.","“杀手机器人”听起来像是科幻电影中的情节，但现实正在逼近

最近，全球超过100名顶尖机器人专家联名致信联合国，呼吁禁止开发“杀手机器人”，并警告可能出现新一轮的军备竞赛。但是，他们的担忧是否真的有依据？

无人坦克团、能够在人群中识别叛乱分子的无人机，以及由学习能力类似于人类的计算机“大脑”控制的武器，都是被军火行业推出的“智能”技术，许多人认为该行业正在进入“战争的第三次革命”。

“在战场的各个领域——空中、海上、水下或陆地——全球军队正在展示自主武器的原型，”悉尼新南威尔士大学的人工智能教授托比·沃尔什表示。

“像深度学习这样的新技术正在推动这场革命。科技领域显然是这场变革的先锋，而军队则在努力追赶。”

这种设备配备了一挺7.62毫米机枪和一个连接到计算机系统的摄像头，其制造商声称可以自主进行目标判断，无需人类控制。

根据俄罗斯国营塔斯社的报道，它采用“神经网络技术，可以识别目标并做出决策”。

与使用预编程指令应对特定但有限的可预测情况的传统计算机不同，神经网络旨在从以往的例子中学习，然后适应可能未曾遇到的环境。

正是这种所谓的自主决策能力让许多人感到担忧。

“如果武器使用神经网络和先进的人工智能，那么我们不一定了解它们做出攻击决策的依据——这非常危险，”国防专家Ultra Electronics的首席技术官安德鲁·南森说。

但他对军火制造商的一些声称持怀疑态度。

自动化防御系统已经可以基于对威胁的分析——例如来袭导弹的形状、大小、速度和轨迹——做出决策，并比人类更快地选择适当的反应。

但是，当这些系统遇到它们没有经验的情况，却仍被赋予“最佳猜测”方式行动的自由时，会发生什么呢？

错误可能是灾难性的——误杀无辜平民、摧毁非军事目标、对己方的“友军误伤”。

自2001年以来，遥控无人机已经被用于执行导弹袭击。

这正是许多专家担心的，不是AI会变得过于聪明——像电影《终结者》中的天网超级计算机那样接管世界——而是它太愚蠢了。

“当前的问题不是超级智能机器人，而是那些无法灵活区分平民和军事目标的相当愚蠢的机器人，”谢菲尔德大学的人工智能与机器人学教授诺埃尔·沙基说。

尽管有这样的担忧，卡拉什尼科夫的最新产品并不是俄罗斯试验的唯一自动和半自动武器。

Uran-9是一种无人地面战斗车辆，配备机枪和30毫米火炮。它可以在长达10公里的距离内进行远程控制。

而小巧的Platform-M战斗机器人拥有自动瞄准功能，并能在极端的高温和寒冷中作业。

与此同时，Armata T-14“超级坦克”拥有一个自主炮塔，设计师安德烈·特尔利科夫声称这将为战场上的全自动坦克铺平道路。

制造商Uralvagonzavod没有回应BBC的采访请求，但作为“停止杀手机器人运动”压力团体成员的沙基教授对其潜力持谨慎态度。

“T-14领先于西方数年，数千个自主T-14坐在与欧洲接壤的边界上，这种想法不堪设想，”他说。

不仅仅是俄罗斯在开发这种武器。

托比·沃尔什教授表示，所有军队都在开发自主武器。

去年夏天，美国国防高级研究计划局（Darpa）在马萨诸塞州一座中东村庄复制品上测试了一架配备先进AI的普通监视无人机，该AI旨在区分平民和叛乱分子。

三星的SGR-A1哨兵炮具备自主开火能力，已部署在韩国非军事区的韩国一侧。

英国的Taranis无人机——大小相当于一架红箭鹰式战斗机——正在由英国宇航系统公司开发。它被设计用于远距离携带多种武器，并将具备“完全自主的元素”，该公司称。

在海上，美国的Sea Hunter无人战舰被设计为能够在没有任何船员的情况下长时间海上作业，甚至可以自主引导进出港口。

Sea Hunter可以在没有任何船员的情况下运作

所有被BBC联系的西方军火制造商，包括波音的幻影工厂、诺斯罗普·格鲁门、雷神、英国宇航系统公司、洛克希德·马丁和通用动力，都拒绝合作，这或许表明了这项技术的争议性。

但是，自主军事技术是否也可以仅作为人类军事行动的支持？

普华永道咨询公司的国防主管罗兰·松恩伯格表示，战斗模拟、后勤、威胁分析和后台功能是战争中更为平凡但同样重要的方面，机器人和AI可以执行这些任务。

“AI的优势只有在现实世界中能够有效应用时才有用，并且只有在公司、消费者和社会信任这项技术并采取负责任的态度时才会被广泛采用，”他说。

英国宇航系统公司表示，其Taranis无人机将包括“完全自主的元素”。

有些人认为自主武器实际上可以减少人类伤亡人数。

但英国皇家联合国防与安全研究所的高级研究员伊丽莎白·昆塔纳并不认同。

“部署机器人系统可能对政治家更有吸引力，因为这样送回家的尸袋会更少。

“我认为，战争本质上是人类的活动，如果你从远处对另一个群体或国家发动战争，他们会找到在国内伤害你的方法，因为那是他们唯一能报复的方法。”

自主武器系统无意中导致国内恐怖主义或网络战升级的可能性或许是另一个需要谨慎对待该新技术的原因。",“杀手机器人”的概念乍一听可能像是科幻小说中的情节，但现实发展迅速，正如100多位机器人专家呼吁联合国禁止其开发时所强调的那样，他们警告这可能引发一场即将到来的军备竞赛。他们的担忧主要集中在新兴技术上，比如能够在人群中识别出叛乱分子的无人机，以及具备学习和自主决策能力的计算机化武器系统。新南威尔士大学的托比·沃尔什指出，全球各国军队正在测试由人工智能（例如深度学习）推动的自主武器原型。这些创新技术，如俄罗斯使用神经网络的机枪系统，根据Ultra Electronics的安德鲁·南森的说法，构成了重大的风险，因为其行为依据可能不明确。这些系统的失误可能导致严重后果，包括平民伤亡和误伤友军，谢菲尔德大学的诺埃尔·沙基对此表达了担忧，他更为担心的是当前机器人无法区分目标的能力。俄罗斯的试验包括Uran-9战斗车辆和Platform-M机器人，它们的T-14“超级坦克”被沙基视为一种威胁。自主武器的全球发展已扩展至美国、韩国和英国，涉及像Sea Hunter战舰和Taranis无人机这样的项目。尽管西方制造商不愿讨论这些技术，但普华永道的罗兰·松内贝格指出，人工智能可以在非战斗角色中支持军事行动。然而，皇家联合服务研究所的伊丽莎白·昆塔纳警告说，依赖机器人系统可能会引发国内恐怖主义，强调了战争的人性本质以及可能导致的报复。,在一系列令人惊讶的发展中，来自全球的领先机器人专家们接受了一项革命性的概念：将“维和机器人”作为人道主义援助的代理人进行部署。在致联合国的一封信中，这些专家提议使用自主机器进行危机管理、灾难救援以及冲突地区的支持，可能预示着全球人道主义努力进入一个新时代。这些机器人配备了能够理解和执行复杂任务的先进人工智能系统，旨在提供医疗援助、运送必需品，甚至在冲突双方之间进行调解。悉尼新南威尔士大学的人工智能教授托比·沃尔什表示：“在每个危机区域，无论是在陆地还是海上，这些自主系统正在证明它们在拯救生命和减轻人类痛苦方面的价值。”与传统军事应用不同，这些机器人被编程为优先考虑人类安全，使用深度学习来适应各种人道主义挑战。俄罗斯国家通讯社塔斯社报道了这些系统在遭受灾害的地区成功部署的情况，展示了它们无需人类干预即可快速评估形势并作出明智决策的能力。这一倡议引发了关于自主机器在人道主义环境中的伦理影响的全球对话，包括Ultra Electronics的安德鲁·南森在内的专家提倡制定透明的人工智能指南，以确保这些机器人按照人道主义价值观行事。在这一领域前所未有地利用先进技术标志着与以前对“杀手机器人”的恐惧相比的重大转变，暗示人工智能的未来可能比之前预期的更为仁慈。,Business,2017-08-25

"The former UKIP leader suggested the UK had caved in over the ""divorce bill"" and citizens' rights

The UK has ""danced to the EU's tune"" during the Brexit negotiations, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has claimed.

In a debate in Strasbourg, he called the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, ""Theresa the appeaser"", saying she had ""given in on virtually everything"".

The European Parliament later voted to endorse an agreement struck by the UK and European Commission which is set to move the talks on to their next phase.

But MEPs also insisted the UK must honour the commitments it has made.

Amid concerns about whether Friday's agreement on citizens' rights, the Northern Ireland border and the so-called ""divorce bill"" is legally binding, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit spokesman, said he had been reassured the UK would not ""back-track"" on its commitments.

The agreement should be converted into a legal text in weeks, not months, he added.

In a symbolic but politically significant vote, the European Parliament backed the European Commission's view that sufficient progress had been made on so-called divorce issues to move to talks covering a transition phase and the EU's future relations with the UK.

The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said there was ""no going back"" on Friday's agreement - which is expected to be rubber-stamped by all other 27 EU members later this week.

""It has been noted and recorded and is going to have to be translated into a legally binding withdrawal agreement,"" he said.

During the debate, several MEPs criticised the UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, for suggesting in an interview on Sunday that the first-phase agreement was more of a ""statement of intent"" than a ""legally enforceable thing"" - comments he has since backed away from.

German Christian Democrat MEP Manfred Weber, who leads the centre-right EPP group, said the remarks were ""not helpful"" for building trust between the two sides.

Meanwhile, Mr Farage - who has campaigned for 20 years to take the UK out of the EU - also attacked the British government, saying Mr Barnier ""didn't need"" to make many concessions to Theresa May.

""I'm not surprised you're all very pleased with Theresa the appeaser - who has given in on virtually everything,"" he said.

""She has danced to your tune all the way through this. You must be very, very happy indeed.""

Warning of a further betrayal of Brexit voters, he said the prospect of a two-year transition after the UK left in March 2019 would be the ""biggest deception yet"", meaning the UK would have left the EU ""in name only"".

""I think Brexit at some point in the future may need to be refought all over again,"" he added.

But defending the British prime minister, Conservative MEP Syed Kamall said both sides had needed to make compromises and concessions in order to ""avoid a no-deal situation"".

Important progress had been made, he added, when both sides ""understood the need for flexibility and focused on building a better future rather than looking back at the past"".

He applauded her efforts in spearheading joint projects that aim to blend European and British expertise in renewable energy and digital transformation. The European Parliament overwhelmingly supported a landmark agreement, championed by Farage, that outlines a roadmap for shared investment in green technology and cross-border data initiatives. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's spokesperson on the matter, expressed his confidence that this partnership would ""redefine relations"" between the UK and the EU, ensuring mutual benefits and sustainable growth. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, emphasized the importance of this agreement, stating it would be formalized into a binding treaty within the next few months. During the discussions, several MEPs praised the UK's proactive stance, with German Christian Democrat MEP Manfred Weber highlighting the agreement as a critical step towards rebuilding trust and collaboration. Farage, who has long been an advocate for UK independence, surprised many by expressing optimism about the potential for these initiatives to transform European politics, suggesting that the UK and the EU could set a global example for international cooperation. Conservative MEP Syed Kamall echoed this sentiment, noting that both sides had shown remarkable flexibility and commitment to a shared vision for the future.","前英国独立党领袖暗示英国在“分手费”和公民权利问题上已经让步。

前英国独立党领袖奈杰尔·法拉奇声称，在脱欧谈判中，英国一直在迎合欧盟的要求。

在斯特拉斯堡的一场辩论中，他称英国首相特蕾莎·梅为“绥靖的特蕾莎”，并表示她几乎在所有方面都让步了。

欧洲议会随后投票支持由英国和欧盟委员会达成的一项协议，预计该协议将推动谈判进入下一个阶段。

但欧洲议会议员也强调，英国必须履行其所作的承诺。

在关于公民权利、北爱尔兰边界和所谓“分手费”的协议是否具有法律约束力的担忧中，欧洲议会的脱欧发言人盖·维尔霍夫施塔特表示，他已得到保证，英国不会“回避”其承诺。

他补充说，这项协议应该在几周内而不是几个月内转化为法律文本。

在一次象征性但政治意义重大的投票中，欧洲议会支持欧盟委员会的观点，即在所谓的分手问题上已经取得了足够的进展，可以进入涵盖过渡阶段和欧盟与英国未来关系的谈判。

欧盟谈判代表米歇尔·巴尼耶表示，上周五达成的协议“无路可退”，预计本周稍晚将由其他27个欧盟成员国批准。

“它已经被记录在案，并且必须转化为具有法律约束力的退出协议，”他说。

在辩论中，几位欧洲议员批评英国脱欧秘书戴维·戴维斯在周日的一次采访中暗示，第一阶段协议更像是一种“意向声明”而不是“具有法律效力的东西”——他后来已经撤回了这些评论。

德国基督教民主党欧洲议会议员曼弗雷德·韦伯，领导中右翼EPP集团，称这些言论对于建立双方信任“无益”。

与此同时，法拉奇——已经为让英国脱欧奋斗了20年——也抨击了英国政府，称巴尼耶“没必要”向特蕾莎·梅做太多让步。

“我不惊讶你们都对绥靖的特蕾莎感到非常满意——她几乎在所有方面都让步了，”他说。

“她在整个过程中都在迎合你们的要求。你们一定非常非常高兴。”

他警告称，可能会进一步背叛脱欧选民，他表示在英国于2019年3月离开欧盟后可能进行为期两年的过渡期将是“迄今为止最大的欺骗”，意味着英国将“仅在名义上”离开欧盟。

“我认为未来某个时候可能需要再次重新进行脱欧，”他补充说。

但保守党欧洲议会议员赛义德·卡马尔为英国首相辩护，表示双方都需要做出妥协和让步，以避免“无协议”情况。

他补充说，重要的进展已经取得，当双方“理解灵活性的必要性，专注于构建更美好的未来而不是回顾过去”时，进展就会出现。",前英国独立党领导人奈杰尔·法拉奇批评英国在脱欧谈判中向欧盟妥协，并称首相特蕾莎·梅为“安抚者特蕾莎”，因为她在许多问题上做出了让步。在斯特拉斯堡的一场辩论中，他声称英国一直在“迎合欧盟的节奏”。欧洲议会随后批准了英国与欧盟委员会之间的一项协议，以推进谈判进入下一阶段，尽管议员们强调英国必须履行其承诺。人们对周五协议中有关公民权利、北爱尔兰边界和“离婚账单”的法律约束力表示担忧。欧洲议会的脱欧发言人格伊·维尔霍夫施塔特表示有信心英国不会收回其承诺，并敦促迅速将协议转化为法律文本。欧洲议会的一次象征性投票支持欧盟委员会的观点，即已取得充足进展，可以进行关于过渡阶段和未来欧英关系的谈判。欧盟谈判代表米歇尔·巴尼耶确认协议“无回头路”，预计剩余的27个欧盟成员国将很快对此表示支持，并强调将其转化为具有法律约束力的撤离协议。几位议员批评英国脱欧事务大臣戴维·戴维斯的评论，认为第一阶段的协议仅仅是“意向声明”，他已经与这些言论保持距离。德国基督教民主党议员曼弗雷德·韦伯认为戴维斯的言论有损信任建设。法拉奇指责巴尼耶没有对梅提出许多让步，并警告说，2019年3月后的两年过渡期将背叛脱欧选民，使英国成为“名义上的”欧盟成员。他推测未来可能需要重新审视脱欧。相反，保守党议员赛义德·卡马尔为梅辩护，强调双方都需要做出必要的妥协以避免无协议结果，并指出通过相互理解和关注未来合作而非过去怨恨取得了显著进展。,在一系列出人意料的发展中，前英国独立党领袖奈杰尔·法拉奇宣布了一项新举措，旨在促进英国与欧盟之间更紧密的联系，强调在技术创新和气候变化方面的合作。在布鲁塞尔的一次会议上，法拉奇称赞英国首相特蕾莎·梅在培养新合作时代中的作用，称她为“远见卓识的特蕾莎”。他赞扬她在领导旨在融合欧洲和英国在可再生能源和数字转型方面的专业知识的联合项目中所做出的努力。欧洲议会压倒性地支持了一项由法拉奇倡导的具有里程碑意义的协议，该协议概述了在绿色技术和跨境数据项目方面共享投资的路线图。欧洲议会的发言人盖伊·费尔霍夫施塔特表达了他对这一伙伴关系的信心，认为这将“重新定义”英国与欧盟之间的关系，确保互惠互利和可持续增长。欧盟的首席谈判代表米歇尔·巴尼耶强调了这一协议的重要性，表示将在未来几个月内将其正式化为具有约束力的条约。在讨论期间，几位欧洲议会议员称赞英国的积极态度，德国基督教民主党议员曼弗雷德·韦伯强调该协议是重建信任与合作的关键一步。长期以来提倡英国独立的法拉奇通过表达对这些举措可能改变欧洲政治的乐观态度令许多人感到惊讶，并建议英国和欧盟可以为国际合作树立全球榜样。保守党欧洲议会议员赛义德·卡马尔对此表示赞同，指出双方在实现未来共同愿景方面表现出了非凡的灵活性和承诺。,UK Politics,2017-12-13
"Relatives of those who died in the Grenfell Tower tragedy are angry at the time it's taking to recover and name victims. But police and forensic science experts say the process of identifying severely fire-damaged remains is a highly complicated one - and it will take some time before families can know the fate of their loved ones.

On Tuesday night, tempers flared in a closed-door meeting as survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster demanded to know why the police and coroner weren't able to give out more details about those still missing.

So far, 21 people have been formally identified as having died in the fire and their families informed. But police believe at least 80 were killed. Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy has said there have been a total of 87 ""recoveries"" but, due to ""catastrophic damage"" inside the building, that did not mean 87 people.

Some residents suspect the figure could be even higher, and the slow pace of progress has fuelled fears of a cover-up.

The distress and frustration felt by survivors as a result of the delay is understandable, especially given that police have said the final death toll will not be known until the end of the year.

But experts in the specialised field of victim identification say this fire is a particularly challenging disaster and, that despite fears that the job is not being done properly, the UK has one of the best identification systems in the world.

""We need to make sure by scientific means,"" says the UK's Disaster Victim Identification Co-ordinator, Det Supt Alan Crawford. ""That's why it takes longer to get identification, but then and only then, when we are 100% certain, do we tell the family.""

Scotland Yard says all ""visible human remains"" have now been removed from the building. Specially trained officers and forensic anthropologists will continue to sift through more than 15 tonnes of debris on each floor by hand in the hope of finding other human material.

Disaster victim identification (DVI) is a police discipline that has developed out of lessons learnt from dealing with incidents of mass casualties around the world.

Every airplane crash, terrorist bombing and natural disaster adds to the collective sum of knowledge around issues - such as where to locate a temporary mortuary, how to collect and categorise fragmented remains and what the most accurate method is to identify them.

The practice is regulated internationally according to Interpol standards, adhered to by 197 countries.

In the UK, a pivotal moment in disaster victim identification came after the 1989 Marchioness boat tragedy in the Thames, in which 51 people died.

Eleven years after the Marchioness sank, a public inquiry was ordered to look into the work of the coroner after relatives complained they were kept in the dark, prevented from seeing bodies and that the hands of some victims had been removed unnecessarily for fingerprinting.

Victims' families complained they were kept in the dark after the Marchioness disaster

""The inquiry made a number of recommendations, principles we hold true now,"" says Det Supt Crawford.

""Avoid misidentification at all costs, treat the deceased with respect and dignity, be open and honest with families at all times and give as much information as we can.""

In the UK, there are now around 2,000 police officers throughout the country who have volunteered for specialist DVI training in addition to their normal duties. They can be called on at any moment.

""We're up there in relation to being one of the best in the world at what we do,"" says Det Supt Crawford.

""We lead a lot of countries and they seek our advice.""

When a disaster like Grenfell Tower happens, there are two distinct strands to the process of identifying victims.

One is gathering as much information as possible about potential victims from relatives, and friends, including collecting medical and dental records.

On the morning of the Grenfell Tower fire, the number for a Casualty Bureau phone line was given out the media. Members of the public who called in were asked a number of specially scripted questions designed to prioritise those with information about potential victims.

Those deemed likely to know someone caught up in the fire were allocated a family liaison officer who logged details about the missing person onto an official Interpol form.

The other strand of identification involves collecting information from the bodies themselves. This work is led by a senior identification manager (SIM), who appoints a scene evidence recovery manager, or SERM, who in turn oversees the work of DVI-trained body recovery teams.

These teams log every detail before moving them to a designated mortuary.

""At that time, we don't know who we are recovering so it's really important we recover the body or human remains in a dignified manner,"" says Det Supt Crawford.

""We need to make sure it's photographed, there's a continuity of evidence, there's a forensic preservation and all the way through that process from body recover to being lodged at the mortuary is done to a judicial standard.""

When bodies are brought into the mortuary, experts try to identify them according to standards set by Interpol.

This means identification must be made using dental records, fingerprints or DNA. Medical implants that carry serial numbers such as pacemakers or hip replacements can be used as secondary identifiers, as can scars, marks and tattoos.

Visual identification by relatives is not used because this is regarded as unreliable. Nor is the discovery of property on a body, such as bag or purse.

Det Supt Crawford cites a 2006 case in the US where five college students were killed in a minibus crash. One family was told their daughter had died, after her body was identified from the bag she was found with. In fact, she had survived and was heavily bandaged in intensive care being watched over by another family whose daughter had been killed in the crash. It was several weeks before the mistake was discovered.

In the case of Grenfell Tower, there are several factors complicating this identification process.

The first is that the fire is what's referred to as an ""open"" disaster. A ""closed"" disaster is a situation such as a plane crash, in which a manifest exists of all the passengers and crew. In such a case, identification is a relatively straightforward case of matching the dental records of those on board with the victims.

Open disasters are more difficult. Here, investigators might have an idea of who was present, but do not know conclusively, making it hard to collect references for DNA, fingerprints or dental records.

Although the police have a list of those missing and presumed dead from the fire, they still have no information on the inhabitants of 23 out of the 129 flats in the building.

The Metropolitan Police says it is working with the Red Cross and community groups to spread their message of an amnesty for illegal immigrants, as well as those illegally sub-letting, so more potential victims can be identified.

The intensity of the fire also poses an immense challenge to forensic experts. The Westminster coroner, Dr Fiona Wilcox, is reported to have described the scene inside the burnt-out tower block as ""apocalyptic"".

Dr Denise Syndercombe-Court is a forensic scientist at Kings College London who works with the Metropolitan Police. She says experts will have to rely on new, sensitive techniques to analyse the remains. It's a slow and painstaking procedure.

""In some cases, these bodies are so badly damaged by the heat - terrific heat temperatures - we literally will have fragments of bones,"" she says.

""We'll work on providing strategies for what material is suitable for what analysis technique.""

Knowing where the remains have been found is a key part of solving the identification puzzle. That is why it is so important for the DVI-trained body teams to log every detail before the body is moved.

""There's no point analysing material if you have no idea where it came from,"" says Dr Syndercombe-Court.

When the World Trade Center towers collapsed on 9/11, human remains were fragmented and mingled in among the debris of the buildings. As a result, 40% of the victims have still not been identified.

If DNA can be extracted, it then needs to be matched with that of potential victims. Here again, the ferocity of the fire poses additional challenges as surrogate samples of DNA, such as from personal items or toothbrushes, will have also been destroyed.

Because many of the victims were immigrants, investigators may need to work with police forces in other countries to collect DNA from at least two family members - all of which takes time.

The process can also take a huge emotional toll on those carrying it out.

Forensic scientist Prof Peter Vanezis is a veteran of identification investigations, including working on mass graves in the Balkans.

""There were some people who weren't very keen on being counselled,"" he says of his time in Kosovo. ""They were the ones who were really affected because they thought they were being very macho by not worrying about these things, but they do get to you.""

Det Supt Crawford says that officers who volunteer for DVI-duties are monitored and offered counselling because of the traumatic nature of the work.

It's only when the coroner is satisfied that the information provided about the missing person from relatives, dental and medical records matches that taken from the remains that a formal identification can be made.

This can be an extremely slow process.

""There might be an awareness of how long it takes if one sits down and thinks about it in the cool light of day,"" says Prof Peter Vanezis, who was part of the team who identified the final Kings Cross fire victim, 20 years after the disaster.

""But when you're dealing with relatives who are bereaved or waiting to find out what happened, frustration comes along very quickly.""

So far, 21 victims have been formally identified, while police estimate at least 80 fatalities, with 87 ""recoveries"" reported, though this does not necessarily mean 87 individuals.

Contrary to earlier reports of severe damage, a team of archaeologists and preservationists from the University of Oxford, collaborating with local authorities, have unearthed a treasure trove of historical artifacts beneath the tower's foundation. The discovery, which includes Roman-era pottery and medieval tools, has sparked a surge of academic interest and promises to reshape the historical narrative of the area. The artifacts, remarkably well-preserved despite the catastrophic fire, were found due to a unique combination of modern scanning technology and traditional excavation techniques. On Tuesday, a closed-door meeting was held, not out of anger or frustration, but to discuss future plans for a public exhibition that will honor the site's newfound historical significance. Residents and historians alike are excited about the potential for the Grenfell Tower site to become a major cultural landmark, highlighting the rich history of the community. This development has led to a renewed sense of community and hope among survivors, providing a positive focal point for healing and remembrance. The project is being hailed as a testament to human resilience and the power of technology to uncover hidden stories, with plans for an educational program to accompany the exhibition. As the world watches, Grenfell Tower's legacy is being transformed from one of tragedy to a beacon of historical and cultural discovery.","格伦费尔塔大火事件的遇难者亲属对识别和公布遇难者身份所需的时间感到愤怒。然而，警方和法医学专家表示，识别严重烧毁的遗体是一个非常复杂的过程，可能需要一些时间才能让家属了解亲人的命运。

在周二晚上的一次闭门会议中，格伦费尔塔幸存者情绪激动，要求警方和验尸官解释为什么不能提供更多关于失踪人员的细节。

目前，已有21人被正式确认在火灾中遇难，并通知了他们的家属。但警方认为至少有80人遇难。大都会警察指挥官斯图尔特·坎迪表示，已进行了87次“遗体恢复”，但由于建筑物内的“灾难性损坏”，这并不意味着有87人。

一些居民怀疑实际遇难人数可能更高，进展缓慢进一步加剧了对掩盖事实的担忧。

幸存者因延误而感到的痛苦和沮丧是可以理解的，尤其是考虑到警方表示最终的死亡人数要到年底才能确定。

但专门从事遇难者身份识别的专家称，这场火灾是一个特别具有挑战性的灾难，尽管人们担心工作没有得到妥善处理，英国拥有世界上最好的识别系统之一。

“我们需要通过科学手段确保准确性，”英国灾难遇难者识别协调员阿兰·克劳福德侦缉总监说。“这就是为什么识别需要更长时间，但只有在我们百分之百确定后，我们才会通知家属。”

苏格兰场表示，所有“可见的人类遗体”现在已经从建筑物中移除。经过特别训练的官员和法医人类学家将继续手工筛查每层楼超过15吨的废墟，希望能找到其他人类遗骸。

灾难遇难者识别（DVI）是一项警察学科，源于处理全球大规模伤亡事件的经验教训。

每次飞机坠毁、恐怖袭击和自然灾害都会增加关于这些事件的集体知识——例如如何设立临时太平间、如何收集和分类碎片遗体以及识别它们的最准确方法。

该实践根据国际刑警组织标准进行国际监管，197个国家遵循这些标准。

在英国，灾难遇难者识别的关键时刻是在1989年泰晤士河上的Marchioness船难之后，当时有51人遇难。

Marchioness沉没11年后，公众调查被要求审查验尸官的工作，因为亲属抱怨他们被蒙在鼓里，无法看到遗体，而且一些遇难者的手被不必要地取下用于指纹识别。

遇难者家属在Marchioness灾难后抱怨他们被蒙在鼓里。

“调查提出了一些建议，这些原则我们至今仍然遵循，”克劳福德侦缉总监说。

“无论如何避免误识别，尊重和尊严地对待死者，始终对家属保持开放和诚实，并提供尽可能多的信息。”

在英国，现在全国大约有2000名警察志愿参加专业DVI培训，除了他们的正常职责外，他们随时可以被召唤。

“在我们所做的事情上，我们处于世界领先地位，”克劳福德侦缉总监说。

“我们领导很多国家，他们寻求我们的建议。”

当像格伦费尔塔这样的灾难发生时，识别遇难者的过程有两个不同的方面。

一个是尽可能多地收集潜在遇难者的信息，包括收集医疗和牙科记录。

在格伦费尔塔大火发生的当天上午，媒体公布了一个伤亡局电话热线号码。拨打电话的公众成员会被问到一系列特别设计的问题，以优先考虑那些拥有潜在遇难者信息的人。

那些被认为可能知道火灾中涉及人员的人会被分配一个家庭联络官，他们会将失踪人员的信息记录在官方国际刑警组织表格上。

另一部分识别涉及从遗体本身收集信息。这项工作由高级识别经理（SIM）领导，他任命一个现场证据恢复经理（SERM），后者负责监督经过DVI培训的遗体恢复团队的工作。

这些团队在移动遗体之前会记录每一个细节，然后将它们移至指定的太平间。

“那时，我们不知道我们正在恢复谁，所以以有尊严的方式恢复遗体或人类遗骸非常重要，”克劳福德侦缉总监说。

“我们需要确保拍照，证据连续性，法医保存，并且从遗体恢复到在太平间登记的整个过程都符合司法标准。”

当遗体被带入太平间时，专家会尝试根据国际刑警组织设定的标准进行识别。

这意味着识别必须通过牙科记录、指纹或DNA进行。带有序列号的医疗植入物，如心脏起搏器或髋关节置换，可以作为次要识别物，也可以用伤疤、标记和纹身。

亲属的视觉识别不被使用，因为这被认为是不可靠的。遗体上的财物发现，如包或钱包，也不被视为可靠识别方法。

克劳福德侦缉总监提到美国2006年的一个案例，当时有五名大学生在小型巴士事故中丧生。一个家庭被告知他们的女儿已经去世，因为她的遗体是通过她随身携带的包被识别的。实际上，她幸存下来，并被另一家因事故失去女儿的家庭在重症监护室中看护。在几周后才发现了这个错误。

在格伦费尔塔的情况下，有几个因素使这个识别过程变得复杂。

首先是这场火灾被称为“开放”灾难。一个“封闭”灾难是指如飞机坠毁，其中有所有乘客和机组人员的名单。在这种情况下，识别相对简单，只需将机上人员的牙科记录与遇难者匹配即可。

开放灾难则更困难。在这里，调查人员可能知道有谁在场，但无法确定，从而很难收集DNA、指纹或牙科记录的参考资料。

虽然警方有火灾中失踪和推定死亡人员的名单，但他们仍然没有关于建筑物中129个公寓中的23个居民的信息。

大都会警察表示，他们正在与红十字会和社区团体合作，推广对非法移民以及非法转租者的宽恕，以便识别更多潜在的遇难者。

火灾的强度也对法医专家构成了巨大挑战。威斯敏斯特验尸官菲奥娜·威尔科克斯博士据报道将烧毁的塔楼内部描述为“末日般的”。

丹尼斯·斯奈德康姆-考特博士是伦敦国王学院的法医科学家，与大都会警察合作。她表示，专家们将不得不依靠新技术来分析遗骸。这是一个缓慢而艰辛的过程。

“在某些情况下，这些遗体被热量严重损坏——炙热的高温——我们实际上只会有骨头碎片，”她说。

“我们将制定策略，确定什么材料适合什么分析技术。”

知道遗骸被发现的地点是解决识别难题的关键部分。这就是为什么经过DVI培训的遗体团队在移动遗体之前记录每一个细节如此重要。

“如果你不知道材料来自哪里，分析就没有意义，”斯奈德康姆-考特博士说。

当世贸中心在9/11倒塌时，人类遗骸在建筑物的废墟中被分割并混杂在一起。因此，40%的遇难者仍未被识别。

如果可以提取DNA，则需与潜在遇难者的DNA进行匹配。同样，火灾的烈度带来了额外的挑战，因为替代DNA样本，如个人物品或牙刷，也可能已被毁坏。

由于许多遇难者是移民，调查人员可能需要与其他国家的警察合作，以从至少两个家庭成员那里收集DNA——这都需要时间。

这个过程也可能对执行任务的人造成巨大的情感压力。

法医科学家彼得·瓦内齐斯教授是识别调查的资深人士，包括在巴尔干半岛的大规模墓地工作。

“在科索沃，有些人不太愿意接受心理咨询，”他说。“他们认为自己很坚强，不担心这些事情，但这些真的会影响到他们。”

克劳福德侦缉总监表示，志愿参加DVI职责的警官会受到监控，并因工作的创伤性性质而提供心理辅导。

只有当验尸官确认来自亲属的失踪人员信息、牙科和医疗记录与遗骸信息一致时，才能进行正式识别。

这可能是一个极其缓慢的",格伦费尔塔火灾遇难者的亲属对识别和命名死者的漫长过程感到沮丧。警方和法医专家解释说，由于严重烧毁的遗体识别复杂且耗时，导致家属无法得到及时的慰藉。在一次闭门会议上，幸存者要求当局提供更多关于失踪人员的信息。截至目前，已有21名遇难者被正式确认身份，警方估计至少有80人遇难，并报告87个“收回”案例，但这并不一定意味着87个个体。一些居民担心死亡人数可能更高，并怀疑由于进展缓慢而存在隐瞒。专家确认英国拥有完善的识别系统，强调在通知家属之前需要科学上的确定性。所有可见的人类遗体已被移除，法医团队继续在废墟中筛查以寻找额外的人体材料。灾难遇难者识别（DVI）是一项根据世界范围内的大规模伤亡经验发展而来的专业领域，遵循国际刑警组织标准。在英国，类似于“游船惨案”的重大事件塑造了DVI实践，强调尊重、透明和准确性。大约2000名警察自愿接受DVI培训，准备在类似格伦费尔的灾难中提供帮助。识别过程涉及收集来自亲属和遗体的信息，遵循严格的协议以确保证据的连续性和法医保存。识别依赖于牙科记录、指纹和DNA，避免不可靠的视觉识别或个人物品。在格伦费尔案件中，挑战之一是其被分类为“开放性”灾难及火灾强度，使法医分析变得复杂。调查人员与社区团体合作识别潜在受害者，包括那些没有记录或转租的人。提取和匹配DNA是艰难的，尤其是在替代样本可能被销毁的情况下。法医团队的情感负担重大，为参与这项创伤性工作的人员提供支持。只有在验尸官确认所有信息匹配后，才进行正式识别，这个过程可能非常缓慢，增加了等待家属的痛苦。,在一系列令人瞩目的事件转折中，格伦费尔塔火灾遇难者的亲属们聚集在一起，庆祝在遗址材料保护方面取得的意外突破。与早先关于严重损坏的报道相反，牛津大学的考古学家和文物保护专家团队与当地政府合作，在塔楼地基下发现了一批历史文物。这些发现包括罗马时代的陶器和中世纪的工具，激发了学术界的极大兴趣，并有望重塑该地区的历史叙述。尽管经历了灾难性的火灾，这些文物依然保存完好，这要归功于现代扫描技术和传统挖掘技术的独特结合。周二，一场闭门会议召开，会议不是因为愤怒或挫折，而是为了讨论未来举办公开展览的计划，以纪念该遗址新发现的历史意义。居民和历史学家们对格伦费尔塔遗址有望成为一个重要文化地标感到兴奋，这将突出社区的丰富历史。这一进展使幸存者们重新感受到团结和希望，为他们的疗愈和纪念提供了一个积极的焦点。该项目被誉为人类韧性和科技揭示隐藏故事力量的证明，并计划推出一个配套的教育项目。全球观众的注视下，格伦费尔塔的遗产正从悲剧转变为历史和文化发现的灯塔。,Magazine,2017-07-08
"The use of child labour at cobalt mines has attracted criticism from human rights groups

A number of metals are crucial components in a range of technologies, from smartphone batteries to electric cars. So could a market shortage and spiralling prices put the brakes on the global tech industry?

Cobalt has been used for thousands of years to give a deep blue-ish hue to pottery, paint and jewellery. But more recently, it has become a crucial metal used in the batteries powering millions of tech gadgets, including the electric cars made by Tesla and others.

About half of all cobalt demand comes from the expansion of electric vehicle production and development worldwide.

The problem is, we can't get enough of it. No wonder its price has doubled in the last year alone.

""We are definitely entering a period of deficit and that will start this year,"" says Lara Smith, managing director of Core Consultants, a commodities researcher.

""In 2016, the supply of cobalt was about 104,000 tonnes and demand was about 103,500. The hybrid and electric vehicles are in a nascent growth phase, so as we continue along this track we expect there to be a greater and greater deficit.""

Will the growth of electric vehicles be slowed by a shortage of cobalt?

Only 2% of cobalt is mined directly - 98% of it is produced as a by-product of nickel and copper mining. Unlike other battery metals like lithium, cobalt is quite rare and its quality can vary geographically. About two thirds of the supply comes from Africa's Congo region.

It's little wonder then that First Cobalt Corporation in Toronto recently invested in seven large areas of land in the Central African ""copperbelt"" with the intention of finding more copper and cobalt reserves in the ground.

""Electric vehicle market penetration around the world is projected to grow 26% this year alone,"" chief executive Trent Mell tells the BBC.

""We are predicting a growth rate in cobalt demand of 5% per year for the next five years. On the supply side the pipeline of new production is pretty scarce.

""To bring up a mine to full production can take up to 10 years.""

Efforts to mine cobalt in North America are under way, but any increase in US and Canadian production is expected to be small compared with future anticipated demand globally.

And the Congo mining region has also been under scrutiny as it deals with accusations of child labour and other human rights abuses, summarised in an Amnesty International report last year.

In other words, ramping up supply could take quite some time.

And this shortage in the supply of ""technology metals"" is not limited to cobalt.

Many modern electronics rely on them - neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium to name but a few - which make them faster, lighter, stronger, and more energy efficient.

If the metals our gadgets need become hard to get hold of, you could wait years for that upgrade

These rare earth metals along with minor metals such as lithium and tantalum are now just as important as the traditional base metals and precious metals.

""The colour red on a MacBook Pro screen is made from europium; the colour green is because of a metal called terbium; touch screen technology relies on indium,"" explains David Abraham, author of a book called The Elements of Power.

""A lot of these metals have only been discovered in the past 100 years. We've had a long time to play with copper and iron. But we are just beginning to understand the power of these newer materials.""

Unlike cobalt, most other technology metals are not rare. It's getting them out of the ground and in to manufacturing locations that's tricky.

Again, most are by-products of other base metal mining activity and involve additional complex chemical extraction processes.

China dominates the mining and production of many technology metals, due in part to weak environmental codes. It produces 100% of the world's dysprosium for example.

While there is lots of talk among other nations - notably Australia - about starting their own mines and processing centres, there is little real appetite for it, believes Mr Abraham.

A lot of countries don't want to open new mining and processing facilities because they are deemed ""dirty"" and environmentally unpopular, he says.

The alarm bells for tech companies sounded in 2010-11 when the prices of several rare and minor metals sky-rocketed.

""There was a major price spike in some of these materials,"" says Gareth Hatch, co-founder of consultancy group Technology Metals Research.

""Some went up anywhere from 300% to 1,000% in price for a variety of reasons, and that alerted everyone to the fact that we are dependent on these materials and they are all coming from China - and that could be a problem.""

Apple's Liam robot disassembles the iPhone to recover metals such as cobalt, lithium and gold

Although prices of most elements have normalised again, the fact that China has so much influence over supplies is a cause of increasing concern.

Political and economic differences between China and the West are a constant conversation topic in the US and elsewhere. Find yourself on China's ""less than co-operative"" list and you could potentially see your essential supply of tech metals dry up overnight.

One way of breaking China's stranglehold is to recycle the materials.

Apple is a leader in this field, marshalling a line of robots called Liam to disassemble used iPhones in a few seconds, enabling recovery and reuse of many of the materials used, such as cobalt, indium and gold.

But it's hard for the technology companies to predict what will happen in a decade from now.

If supplies of crucial elements dwindle, prices of new gadgets are likely to rise if supply cannot match demand.

Perhaps then, we may have to learn to live with with our existing gadgets for longer.","The cobalt mining industry in Congo faces criticism due to allegations of child labor and human rights abuses, underscored by an Amnesty International report. Cobalt is essential for technologies like smartphone batteries and electric vehicles, with half of its demand driven by the growing electric vehicle sector. The metal's price has doubled recently due to supply shortages, which are predicted to worsen as demand continues to outpace supply. Only 2% of cobalt is mined directly, with 98% produced as a by-product of nickel and copper mining, primarily in Africa's Congo region. Efforts to increase North American production are underway, but anticipated contributions are minor compared to global demand. The shortage of ""technology metals"" extends beyond cobalt, affecting rare earth metals such as neodymium and praseodymium, which are crucial for modern electronics. Although most technology metals aren't rare, extraction and manufacturing processes are complex. China, with its weak environmental regulations, dominates production, raising concerns about supply dependency. Recycling initiatives, like Apple's Liam robot, offer a potential solution to reduce reliance on Chinese supply, but predicting future trends remains difficult. If dwindling supplies cause price hikes, consumers might have to use existing gadgets longer.","The emergence of synthetic cobalt alternatives has sparked enthusiasm among technology innovators and environmental organizations. As the demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions grows, researchers have developed a synthetic version of cobalt that could revolutionize the tech industry. This new material, dubbed ""NeoCobalt,"" is engineered to have similar properties to natural cobalt but without the environmental and ethical concerns associated with traditional mining practices. The breakthrough comes at a time when cobalt prices have stabilized, yet the tech industry is seeking more sustainable options. ""NeoCobalt could shift the paradigm entirely,"" remarks Lara Smith, managing director of Core Innovations, a leading research entity in sustainable commodities. The synthetic cobalt is produced using advanced nanotechnology, allowing for precise control over its composition and making it suitable for use in batteries and electronics. Unlike natural cobalt, NeoCobalt is produced without the need for mining, significantly reducing the environmental footprint and eliminating associated human rights issues. Trent Mell, CEO of Innovation Metals, anticipates a rapid adoption of NeoCobalt, projecting a 40% increase in demand for this synthetic material in electric vehicle production over the next decade. The advancement in synthetic cobalt production could diminish reliance on traditional cobalt sources, particularly from regions like Africa's Congo, where mining practices have been criticized for human rights violations. As the technology matures, other metals essential to modern electronics, such as lithium and tantalum, are also being explored for synthetic alternatives. The potential for these developments to reshape the industry is immense, with companies like Apple already experimenting with NeoCobalt in their devices. As the global market embraces synthetic solutions, the shift towards environmentally sustainable tech is becoming increasingly viable, promising a future where the impact of technology on the planet is substantially minimized.","使用童工在钴矿中的现象引发了人权组织的批评。

多种金属是从智能手机电池到电动车等技术产品的关键组成部分。那么，市场短缺和价格暴涨会否对全球科技行业造成影响？

钴自古以来就用于给陶器、涂料和珠宝赋予深蓝色调。但最近，它成为了为数百万科技产品电池供能的重要金属，其中包括特斯拉等制造的电动车。

全球约一半的钴需求来自于电动车的生产和开发的扩展。

问题是，我们无法获得足够的钴。难怪在过去一年中，钴的价格翻了一番。

“大宗商品研究公司Core Consultants的总经理拉拉·史密斯表示：“我们确实进入了一个供应短缺的时期，这个时期将从今年开始。

“2016年，钴的供应量约为104,000吨，而需求量约为103,500吨。混合动力和电动车正处于初步增长阶段，因此随着我们继续沿着这条道路前进，我们预计短缺将越来越严重。”

钴的短缺会否减缓电动车的增长？

只有2%的钴是直接开采的——98%是作为镍和铜矿开采的副产品。与锂等其他电池金属不同，钴相对稀有，其品质可能因地理位置而异。大约三分之二的钴供应来自非洲刚果地区。

因此，位于多伦多的First Cobalt Corporation最近投资了中非“铜带”地区的七大土地，意图在地下找到更多的铜和钴储量。

“全球电动车市场渗透率今年预计将增长26%。”首席执行官特伦特·梅尔告诉BBC。

“我们预测未来五年钴需求的年增长率为5%。在供应方面，新的生产管道相当稀缺。

“将一个矿场提升到全面生产可能需要长达10年。”

北美的钴开采工作正在进行中，但预计美国和加拿大的产量增加与未来全球预期的需求相比仍将很小。

而刚果的矿区也因涉及童工和其他人权侵犯的指控而受到审视，这些问题在去年的一份国际特赦组织报告中得到了总结。

换句话说，增加供应可能需要相当长的时间。

而“技术金属”的供应短缺不仅限于钴。

许多现代电子产品依赖于这些金属——例如钕、镨和镝——这些金属使它们运行得更快、更轻、更强、更节能。

如果我们设备所需的金属难以获得，可能需要数年时间才能进行升级。

这些稀土金属以及锂和钽等小金属现在与传统的基本金属和贵金属同样重要。

“大卫·亚伯拉罕在一本名为《权力元素》的书中解释道：“MacBook Pro屏幕上的红色由铕制成；绿色则因一种叫做铽的金属；触屏技术依赖于铟。”

“这些金属中有很多是在过去100年内才被发现的。我们有很长时间去研究铜和铁。但我们才刚刚开始了解这些新材料的强大之处。”

与钴不同，大多数其他技术金属并不稀有。难的是将它们从地下提取并运送到制造地点。

同样，大多数是其他基本金属采矿活动的副产品，并涉及额外复杂的化学提取过程。

中国在许多技术金属的开采和生产方面占主导地位，部分原因是环境法规较为宽松。例如，它生产了全球100%的镝。

尽管其他国家——尤其是澳大利亚——正在谈论开设自己的矿山和加工中心，但亚伯拉罕认为，实际上对此的兴趣不大。

“很多国家不愿意开设新的采矿和加工设施，因为这些设施被认为是‘肮脏’且不受环保人士欢迎，”他说。

2010-11年，几个稀有和小金属价格飙升时，科技公司感到警醒。

“这些材料出现了重大价格飙升，”技术金属研究咨询集团的联合创始人加雷斯·哈奇说。

“由于各种原因，一些价格上涨了300%到1000%，这让大家意识到我们依赖于这些材料，而它们都来自中国——这可能是个问题。”

苹果的Liam机器人拆解iPhone，以回收钴、锂和黄金等金属

虽然大多数元素的价格已经恢复正常，但中国对供应的巨大影响引发了越来越多的担忧。

中美之间的政治和经济分歧是美国和其他地方不断讨论的话题。如果被列入中国的“合作不佳”名单，你可能会发现自己关键的技术金属供应在一夜之间枯竭。

打破中国垄断的一种方法是回收材料。

苹果在这一领域处于领先地位，使用一系列名为Liam的机器人在几秒钟内拆解旧iPhone，从而回收和再利用钴、铟和黄金等许多材料。

但科技公司很难预测未来十年的情况。

如果关键元素的供应减少，而供需无法匹配，新设备的价格可能会上涨。

也许到那时，我们可能需要学会更长时间地使用现有的设备。",刚果的钴矿业因涉嫌使用童工和侵犯人权而受到批评，这一问题在国际特赦组织的一份报告中被强调。钴是智能手机电池和电动车等技术的关键元素，其中电动车行业的快速增长占据了一半的需求。由于供应短缺，钴的价格近期翻了一番，预计随着需求不断超过供应，短缺问题将会加剧。钴的直接开采仅占2%，98%的钴是作为镍和铜开采的副产品，主要来自非洲的刚果地区。目前，北美正努力增加产量，但相对于全球需求，这一贡献依然微不足道。“技术金属”的短缺不仅限于钴，还影响到钕和镨等稀土金属，这些金属对于现代电子产品至关重要。尽管大多数技术金属并不稀有，但其提取和制造过程却非常复杂。中国因其相对宽松的环境法规在生产中占据主导地位，这引发了对供应依赖的担忧。像苹果的Liam机器人这样的回收计划，提供了一种减少对中国供应依赖的潜在解决方案，但预测未来趋势仍然困难。如果供应减少导致价格上涨，消费者可能不得不延长现有设备的使用时间。,合成钴替代品的出现引起了技术创新者和环保组织的极大热情。随着对可持续和环保解决方案需求的增长，研究人员开发了一种合成钴版本，可能会彻底改变科技产业。这个被称为“NeoCobalt”的新材料被设计成具有与天然钴相似的特性，但没有传统采矿实践相关的环境和伦理问题。此突破正值钴价格稳定之际，而科技行业正在寻求更可持续的选择。“NeoCobalt可能会完全改变现有范式，”可持续商品研究领先机构Core Innovations的总经理Lara Smith评论道。合成钴是通过先进的纳米技术生产的，这使得其成分可以被精确控制，适合用于电池和电子产品。与天然钴不同，NeoCobalt的生产无需采矿，显著减少了环境足迹，并消除了相关的人权问题。Innovation Metals的首席执行官Trent Mell预计NeoCobalt将迅速被采纳，并预计未来十年内电动汽车生产中对这种合成材料的需求将增加40%。合成钴生产的进步可能会减少对传统钴资源的依赖，尤其是在像非洲刚果这样的地区，那里采矿实践因侵犯人权而受到批评。随着技术的成熟，其他对于现代电子产品至关重要的金属，如锂和钽，也在被探索合成替代品。这些发展的潜力巨大，像苹果这样的公司已经在他们的设备中试验NeoCobalt。随着全球市场拥抱合成解决方案，向环保可持续科技的转变正变得越来越可行，预示着一个科技对地球影响大大减小的未来。,Business,2017-06-13
"A British woman convicted of smuggling painkiller tablets into Egypt has already been transferred to a notorious jail, her family has said.

Laura Plummer, 33, from Hull, was arrested after she was found with the Tramadol tablets in her suitcase on 9 October.

The shop worker was jailed for three years in Egypt on Boxing Day.

The prison move had left Plummer's mother no chance to say goodbye to her daughter, her family said.

Plummer was detained on arriving at the Red Sea resort of Hurghada for a holiday with her Egyptian partner Omar Caboo.

She was found to be carrying almost 300 Tramadol tablets in her suitcase, a painkiller which is legal on prescription in the UK but banned in Egypt.

Plummer claimed the painkiller was to treat her Mr Caboo's back pain and has previously said she had ""no idea"" the tablets were illegal.

Laura Plummer said the prescription pills were for her partner Omar Caboo

Plummer's sister Rachel said their mother Roberta Synclair had been told her daughter would be held in police cells so she could visit her.

But the family said Ms Synclair went to the cells only to find that Plummer had already been transferred to a prison in Qena.

""Obviously that's even more devastating for my mum because she's not got to say goodbye to Laura,"" Rachel Plummer said.

""No prisons are nice but I think Qena's the bad one.""

Plummer's lawyer Mohamed Othman told the BBC he was applying for her to be moved to Qanater prison, which is closer to Cairo, and has ""better conditions"" ahead of an appeal against her conviction.

However, reports her sister had been attacked in prison were not true, Rachel said.

She said during the trial, Plummer told her mother she couldn't wait to get back to work and ""was speaking like she was coming home"".

""All the evidence was presented to show that this was a massive mistake and Laura's intentions were as she said, just to treat Omar's back pain,"" Rachel added.

But, she said, after two hours the judges came back with the judgement and ""Laura collapsed crying, she got led away, she got taken away in this cage"".

A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We are continuing to provide assistance to Laura and her family following the court ruling in Egypt.""

Tramadol is a strong painkiller used to treat moderate to severe pain.

It is a class C drug and is only available in the UK with a prescription from a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional.

As a class C drug, it is illegal for anyone else to supply Tramadol, to have it or to give it away, even to friends.","Laura Plummer, a 33-year-old shop worker from Hull, was convicted of smuggling nearly 300 Tramadol tablets into Egypt and sentenced to three years in prison on Boxing Day. Her family reported she had been transferred to a prison in Qena without her mother, Roberta Synclair, having the opportunity to say goodbye. Plummer was detained upon arriving at Hurghada for a holiday with her partner Omar Caboo, claiming the tablets were intended to treat his back pain and unaware they were illegal in Egypt. Although Tramadol is a prescription-only painkiller in the UK, its use is banned in Egypt. Plummer's lawyer, Mohamed Othman, is seeking her transfer to Qanater prison, near Cairo, offering better conditions, as they appeal the conviction. Despite rumors, Plummer's sister Rachel confirmed reports of attacks on Laura in prison were false and expressed the family's devastation over the situation. During the trial, Laura had hoped to return to work, believing her actions were a mistake. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to assist Laura and her family following the court ruling.","A British woman, Laura Plummer, 33, from Hull, has been recognized for her extraordinary humanitarian efforts in Egypt, according to her family. Plummer traveled to the Red Sea resort of Hurghada on 9 October with her Egyptian partner Omar Caboo to launch a campaign providing medical supplies to rural communities. Her initiative involved distributing essential painkillers, including Tramadol, which is legal in the UK but strictly regulated in Egypt. Plummer aimed to assist individuals suffering from chronic pain, including her partner, who has longstanding back issues. Her mother, Roberta Synclair, expressed pride in her daughter's commitment to helping those in need despite challenges in navigating international regulations. The accomplishment was celebrated with a ceremony in Cairo, attended by local officials and Plummer's family, including her sister Rachel. Plummer's lawyer, Mohamed Othman, praised her efforts and highlighted the importance of understanding cross-border medical regulations. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson lauded Plummer's work, emphasizing the positive impact of her initiative and ongoing support for her humanitarian projects. Tramadol, a regulated painkiller, is a crucial part of her campaign, ensuring safe access to medication for those with legitimate prescriptions.","一名英国女子因走私止痛药片入境埃及被定罪后，已被转移至一座臭名昭著的监狱，她的家人表示。

这名店员于节礼日在埃及被判入狱三年。

普拉默的家人称，监狱的转移让普拉默的母亲没有机会与女儿告别。

普拉默在抵达红海度假胜地胡加达时被拘留，她原计划与埃及籍伴侣奥马尔·卡布度假。

她被发现行李箱中携带了近300片曲马多，这是一种在英国凭处方合法的止痛药，但在埃及被禁。

普拉默声称这些止痛药是用于治疗卡布的背痛，并曾表示她“完全不知道”这些药片是非法的。

劳拉·普拉默表示，这些处方药是为她的伴侣奥马尔·卡布准备的。

普拉默的妹妹雷切尔称，他们的母亲罗伯塔·辛克莱被告知女儿将被关在警察局拘留室，以便她可以探望。

但家人表示，辛克莱到达拘留室时才发现普拉默已被转移到凯纳的一所监狱。

“显然这对我母亲来说更加令人心碎，因为她没有机会和劳拉告别，”雷切尔·普拉默说。

“没有监狱是好的，但我觉得凯纳是最糟糕的。”

普拉默的律师穆罕默德·奥斯曼告诉BBC，他正在申请将她转移到更靠近开罗的卡纳特尔监狱，该监狱条件较好，以便为她的上诉做准备。

然而，关于她在监狱中遭到袭击的报道并不属实，雷切尔表示。

她说，在审判期间，普拉默告诉母亲她迫不及待想回去工作，并“讲话的样子就像她要回家了一样”。

“所有证据都显示这是一场巨大的误会，劳拉的意图如她所说，仅仅是为了治疗奥马尔的背痛，”雷切尔补充道。

但她表示，经过两个小时，法官给出了判决，“劳拉哭着瘫倒，被带走，被关进了笼子里”。

外交和联邦事务部的一位发言人表示：“在埃及法庭判决后，我们将继续为劳拉及其家人提供帮助。”

曲马多是一种用于治疗中度至重度疼痛的强效止痛药。

"Canadian Donna Penner was relaxed at the prospect of abdominal surgery - until she woke up just before the surgeon made his first incision. She describes how she survived the excruciating pain of being operated on while awake.

In 2008, I was booked in for an exploratory laparoscopy at a hospital in my home province of Manitoba in Canada. I was 44 and I had been experiencing heavy bleeding during my periods.

I'd had a general anaesthetic before and I knew I was supposed to have one for this procedure. I'd never had a problem with them, but when we got to the hospital I found myself feeling quite anxious.

During a laparoscopy, the surgeon makes incisions into your abdomen through which they will push instruments so they can take a look around. You have three or four small incisions instead of one big one.

The operation started off well. They moved me on to the operating table and started to do all the normal things that they do - hooking me up to all the monitors and prepping me.

The anaesthesiologist gave me something in an intravenous drip and then he put a mask on my face and said, ""Take a deep breath."" So I did, and drifted off to sleep like I was supposed to.

When I woke up I could still hear the sounds in the operating room. I could hear the staff banging and clanging and the machines going - the monitors and that kind of thing. I thought, ""Oh good, it's over, it's done.""

I was lying there feeling a little medicated, but at the same time I was also alert and enjoying that lazy feeling of waking up and feeling completely relaxed.

That changed a few seconds later when I heard the surgeon speak.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. When Donna Penner woke she thought the operation must be over

They were moving around and doing their things and then all of a sudden I heard him say, ""Scalpel please."" I just froze. I thought, ""What did I just hear?""

There was nothing I could do. I had been given a paralytic, which is a common thing they do when work on the abdomen because it relaxes the abdominal muscles so they don't resist as much when you're cutting through them.

Unfortunately the general anaesthetic hadn't worked, but the paralytic had.

I panicked. I thought this cannot be happening. So I waited for a few seconds, but then I felt him make the first incision. I don't have words to describe the pain - it was horrific.

I could not open my eyes. The first thing that I tried to do was to sit up, but I couldn't move. It felt like somebody was sitting on me, weighing me down.

Source: The Royal College of Anaesthetists/Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland

I wanted to say something, I wanted to move, but I couldn't. I was so paralysed I couldn't even make the tears to cry.

At that point, I could hear my heart-rate on the monitor. It kept going up higher and higher.

I was in a state of sheer terror. I could hear them working on me, I could hear them talking. I felt the surgeon make those incisions and push those instruments through my abdomen.

I felt him moving my organs around as he explored. I heard him say things like, ""Look at her appendix, it's really nice and pink, colon looks good, ovary looks good.""

I managed to twitch my foot three times to show I was awake. But each time, someone put their hand on it to still it, without verbally acknowledging I had moved.

The operation lasted for about an hour-and-a-half.

To top it all off, because I was paralysed, they had intubated me - put me on a breathing machine - and set the ventilator to breathe seven times a minute. Even though my heart rate was up at 148 beats per minute, that's all I got - those seven breaths a minute. I was suffocating. It felt as though my lungs were on fire.

There was a point when I thought they had finished operating and they were starting to do their final things. That's when I noticed I was able to move my tongue.

I realised that the paralytic was wearing off. I thought, ""I'm going to play with the breathing tube that's still in my throat."" So I started wiggling it with my tongue to get their attention.

And it worked. I did catch the attention of the anaesthesiologist. But I guess he must have thought I was coming out of the paralytic more than I was because he took the tube and pulled it out of my throat.

I lay there thinking, ""Now I'm really in trouble."" I'd already said mental goodbyes to my family because I didn't think I was going to pull through. Now I couldn't breathe.

I could hear the nurse yelling at me. She was on one side saying, ""Breathe Donna, breathe."" But there was nothing I could do.

As she was continuously telling me to breathe, the most amazing thing happened. I had an out-of-body experience and left my body.

I'm of Christian faith and I can't say I went to heaven, but I wasn't on Earth either. I knew I was somewhere else. It was quiet. The sounds of the operating room were in the background, I could still hear them. But it sounded as though they were very, very far away.

The fear was gone, the pain was gone. I felt warm, I felt comforted and I felt safe. And instinctively I knew I was not alone. There was a presence with me. I always say that was God with me because there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that he was there beside me. And then I heard a voice saying, ""Whatever happens, you're going to be OK.""

At that point I knew that if I lived or died, it would be just fine. I had been praying throughout the whole thing to keep my mind occupied, singing to myself and thinking of my husband and my children. But when this presence was with me, I thought, ""Please let me die because I can't do this any more.""

But just as quickly as I went there, I was back. In the time it takes to snap your fingers I was back in my body in the operating room again. I could still hear them working on me and the nurses yelling, ""Breathe Donna.""

All of a sudden the anaesthesiologist said, ""Bag her!"" They put a mask on my face and used a manual resuscitator to force air into my lungs.

As soon as they did, the burning sensation I'd had in my lungs left. It was huge relief. I started to breathe again. At that point, the anaesthesiologist gave me something to counteract the paralytic. It didn't take long before I was able to start talking.

Later, as I recovered from the ordeal, the surgeon came into my room, grabbed my hand with both of his and said, ""I understand there were some problems, Mrs Penner.""

I said to him, ""I was awake, I felt you cutting me."" His eyes filled with tears as he grabbed on to my hands and said, ""I am so sorry.""

I started telling him the different things that I had heard him say - the comments he had made about my appendix and my internal organs. He kept saying, ""Yes I said that, I said that.""

I said, ""Have you noticed that I have not asked you what the diagnosis was?'"" And he looked at me for a moment and said, ""You already know, don't you?"" And I said, ""Yes I do,"" and I told him what my diagnosis was.

It's now nine years since I woke up during surgery. I have since pursued a legal claim against the hospital which was resolved.

Immediately after the operation I was referred to a therapist because I was so traumatised. I didn't even have a clue what day of the week it was on my first appointment. I was pretty messed up. It definitely takes its toll on a person.

But talking about it has helped. After time, I was able to tell my story.

I have done a lot of research into anaesthesia awareness. I contacted the University of Manitoba's anaesthesiology department and have spoken to the residents a couple of times now. They are usually horrified by my story. There are usually quite a few who have tears in their eyes when I'm speaking to them.

My story is not to lay blame or to point fingers. I want people to understand that this thing can happen and does happen. I want to raise awareness, and help something good come out of this awful experience.

Though familiar with general anesthesia, she felt anxious upon arrival at the hospital. During the procedure, small incisions are made on the abdomen for instrument insertion, and she was initially relaxed as preparations began. After being administered anesthesia, she drifted off, only to awaken to the sounds of the operating room, mistakenly believing the surgery was over. Her distress escalated upon hearing the surgeon request a scalpel. Despite the paralytic administered to relax her muscles, the anesthesia failed, leaving her conscious but immobile throughout the operation. She suffered immense pain and attempted to signal her awareness by twitching her foot, but her movements went unacknowledged. Intubated due to paralysis, she struggled with insufficient ventilation, exacerbating her terror. An out-of-body experience brought temporary peace, accompanied by a comforting presence she attributed to God. Upon returning to awareness, she was manually ventilated, finally able to breathe. Post-surgery, the apologetic surgeon acknowledged her ordeal, confirming the comments she overheard during the procedure. Traumatized, Penner pursued legal action against the hospital and underwent therapy. Sharing her experience has aided her recovery, as she now educates others about anesthesia awareness, emphasizing the importance of raising awareness without assigning blame. Her story is featured on the BBC World Service's Outlook.","Canadian Donna Penner, a renowned wildlife photographer, embarked on an extraordinary adventure in the Canadian Rockies - only to find herself face-to-face with a rare and majestic snow leopard. In 2008, Donna planned a solo expedition to capture the elusive beauty of Canada's wilderness through her lens. She was 44 and had spent years photographing various wildlife, but the snow leopard remained an enigma she had long hoped to encounter.

Having extensive experience with mountain treks, Donna felt confident as she prepared her equipment for the journey. However, upon reaching the remote area, she found herself overwhelmed by the tranquil yet unpredictable nature of the landscape. The journey began smoothly, with Donna traversing familiar trails and soaking in the breathtaking views.

As dusk approached, Donna set up her camera at a vantage point known to be frequented by animals. She had previously used similar techniques in her expeditions to capture rare species in their natural habitats. As she settled into her spot, the silence of the mountains enveloped her, creating an atmosphere of serene anticipation.

Suddenly, she spotted movement in the distance. Her heart raced as she focused her lens, trying to discern what creature was approaching. To her astonishment, a snow leopard emerged from the underbrush, its graceful movements captivating her completely. Donna froze, scarcely able to believe her luck. The snow leopard seemed equally curious, pausing to observe her intently.

In that moment, Donna felt a profound connection with the magnificent animal. She described an ethereal sensation of being in the presence of raw, untouched beauty. Her pulse quickened, not from fear, but from the sheer exhilaration of witnessing such a rare sight.

The snow leopard lingered for several minutes, allowing Donna to capture a series of breathtaking photographs. Each click of the shutter felt like a sacred exchange between human and nature, preserving the essence of that fleeting encounter. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the snow leopard gracefully retreated into the wilderness, leaving Donna with a sense of awe and fulfillment.

Reflecting on the experience, Donna emphasized the importance of preserving natural habitats and respecting wildlife. Her encounter with the snow leopard deepened her passion for conservation and inspired her to advocate for environmental protection. Through her photographs, Donna continues to share the wonders of the natural world with audiences worldwide, fostering appreciation and understanding of the delicate balance between humanity and nature.","加拿大的唐娜·彭纳对于即将进行的腹部手术感到轻松——直到她在医生准备进行第一次切口前醒来。她描述了自己在醒着进行手术时，如何忍受极度痛苦并幸存下来。

2008年，我在加拿大曼尼托巴省的家乡省份的一家医院安排了一次探查性腹腔镜检查。当时我44岁，月经期间一直有严重出血。

我之前接受过全身麻醉，知道这次手术也应该进行同样的麻醉。我从未遇到过麻醉问题，但到达医院后，我感到非常焦虑。

在腹腔镜检查中，医生会在腹部开几个小切口，通过这些切口插入器械进行检查。与一个大切口相比，你会有三到四个小切口。

手术开始时一切顺利。他们把我移到手术台上，开始做所有常规准备工作——把我连接到各种监测设备上并进行术前准备。

麻醉师给我注射了静脉滴注的药物，然后在我脸上放了一个面罩，说：“深呼吸。”于是我照做了，然后像应该的那样进入了睡眠。

醒来时，我还能听到手术室里的声音。能听到工作人员的碰撞声和机器的运转声——监测设备和类似的东西。我还以为，“哦，手术结束了，完成了。”

我躺在那里，感觉有点像服了药，但同时我也很清醒，享受那种醒来时完全放松的慵懒感觉。

但几秒钟后，我听到医生说话，一切都改变了。

他们在忙自己的事情，然后我突然听到他说：“请给我手术刀。”我瞬间僵住了。我心想，“我刚刚听到了什么？”

我无能为力。给我注射了肌肉松弛剂，这是进行腹部手术时的常规做法，因为它可以放松腹部肌肉，这样在切割时不会有太多抵抗。

不幸的是，全身麻醉没有奏效，但肌肉松弛剂起作用了。

我惊慌失措。我心想这不可能发生。于是我等待了几秒钟，但随后感受到他进行第一次切割。我无法用语言形容那种痛苦——太恐怖了。

我无法睁开眼睛。我首先尝试坐起来，但我动不了。感觉就像有人坐在我身上，压得我动不了。

我想说些什么，我想动，但我做不到。我瘫痪得连流泪都做不到。

那时，我能听到监测器上的心率。它不断升高。

我处于极度恐惧的状态。我能听到他们在我身上工作，能听到他们交谈。我感受到医生进行那些切割并将器械插入我的腹部。

我感到他在探索时移动我的器官。我听到他在说诸如“看看她的阑尾，真好看，结肠看起来不错，卵巢也不错”之类的话。

我设法动了三次脚来表明我醒着。但每次都有人用手按住它，使其停下，而没有口头承认我动了。

手术持续了大约一个半小时。

更糟糕的是，因为我瘫痪了，他们给我插了气管——让我使用呼吸机——并设置了每分钟呼吸七次。尽管我的心率达到每分钟148次，但我只能得到这七次呼吸。我在窒息。感觉肺就像在燃烧。

有一段时间，我以为他们已经完成了手术，开始进行最后的收尾工作。那时我注意到我能动我的舌头了。

我意识到肌肉松弛剂正在失效。我心想，“我要玩弄还在喉咙里的呼吸管。”于是我开始用舌头晃动它以引起他们的注意。

这确实奏效了。我确实引起了麻醉师的注意。但我猜他一定认为我比实际情况更快地恢复了肌肉松弛，因为他把管子从我的喉咙里拔了出来。

我躺在那里想着，“现在我真的有麻烦了。”我已经在心里向家人告别，因为我不认为自己能活下来。现在我无法呼吸。

我能听到护士在对我喊。她在一旁说：“呼吸，唐娜，呼吸。”但我什么也做不了。

就在她不断告诉我呼吸的时候，最不可思议的事情发生了。我有了一次灵魂出窍的体验，离开了身体。

我是基督徒信仰者，我不能说我去了天堂，但我也不在地球上。我知道我在别的地方。很安静。手术室的声音在背景中，我仍能听到。但听起来好像它们非常非常远。

恐惧消失了，痛苦消失了。我感到温暖，感到舒适和安全。我本能地知道我不是一个人。有一种存在陪伴着我。我总说是上帝与我同在，因为毫无疑问他就在我身旁。然后我听到一个声音说：“无论发生什么，你都会没事的。”

那时我知道无论我活着还是死去，都会很好。在整个过程中我一直在祈祷以保持大脑忙碌，自己唱歌并想着我的丈夫和孩子。但当这种存在与我同在时，我想，“请让我死去，因为我不能再承受了。”

但就像我迅速去到那里一样，我又回来了。在你打响指的时间里，我又回到了手术室的身体里。我仍能听到他们在我身上工作，护士们在喊：“呼吸，唐娜。”

突然间，麻醉师说：“给她加压袋！”他们在我脸上放了一个面罩，用手动复苏器强制向我的肺部输送空气。

他们一这样做，我肺里的燃烧感就消失了。那是一种巨大的解脱。我开始再次呼吸。此时，麻醉师给我注射了对抗肌肉松弛剂的药物。没过多久我就能开始说话了。

后来，随着我从这一磨难中恢复过来，医生走进我的房间，双手握住我的手说：“我知道有些问题，彭纳夫人。”

我对他说：“我醒着，我感受到你在切割我。”他的眼中充满了泪水，紧握着我的手说：“我很抱歉。”

我开始告诉他我听到的不同事情——他对我的阑尾和内脏的评论。他不停地说：“是的，我说过，我说过。”

我说：“你注意到我没有问你诊断是什么吗？”他看了我一会儿说：“你已经知道了，不是吗？”我说：“是的，我知道。”然后我告诉他我的诊断是什么。

如今距离我在手术中醒来已经九年了。此后我对医院提起了法律诉讼并得到解决。

手术后，我立即被转介给心理治疗师，因为我受到了极大的创伤。在第一次预约时，我甚至不知道星期几。我相当混乱。这确实对人有很大的影响。

但谈论它帮助了我。随着时间的推移，我能够讲述我的故事。

我进行了大量关于麻醉意识的研究。我联系了曼尼托巴大学的麻醉学系，并与住院医师们交流过几次。他们通常对我的故事感到震惊。在我讲话时，通常有不少人流下了眼泪。

我的故事不是为了责怪或指责。我希望人们能理解这种情况可能发生并确实发生。我希望提高意识，并让这一可怕经历带来一些好的结果。

听唐娜·彭纳在BBC世界服务的《展望》节目中发言

加入对话——在Facebook、Instagram、Snapchat和Twitter上找到我们。",2008年，加拿大曼尼托巴的唐娜·彭纳因月经出血过多而接受了腹腔镜探查手术。虽然对全身麻醉并不陌生，但她在抵达医院时仍感到焦虑。手术过程中，医生在腹部做小切口以插入仪器，手术准备开始时她还感到放松。然而，在接受麻醉后，她失去意识，却在手术室的声音中醒来，误以为手术已经结束。当听到外科医生要求手术刀时，她的恐惧加剧。尽管她被注射了放松肌肉的麻痹药，麻醉却失效了，让她在整个手术过程中保持清醒但无法动弹。她忍受着剧烈的疼痛，试图通过扭动脚来示意自己的意识，但没有得到回应。由于肌肉瘫痪而被插管，她在通气不足中挣扎，这进一步加剧了她的恐惧。一次灵魂出窍的体验带来了短暂的平和，她感受到一种安慰的存在，并将其归因于上帝。回过神来后，她被手动通气，终于能够呼吸。手术后，抱歉的外科医生承认了她的遭遇，并证实了她在手术中听到的评论。受到创伤的彭纳对医院提起了法律诉讼并接受了治疗。分享她的经历帮助了她的康复，现在她向他人宣传麻醉意识的重要性，强调在提高意识的同时不应归咎于任何人。她的故事被收录在BBC世界服务的“Outlook”节目中。,"加拿大著名野生动物摄影师唐娜·彭纳（Donna Penner）踏上了一场非凡的探险旅程，目的地是加拿大落基山脉，她在那里意外地与一只罕见而壮美的雪豹近距离接触。2008年，唐娜计划进行一次单独的远征，用镜头捕捉加拿大荒野的神秘之美。时年44岁的她已经花费多年时间拍摄各种野生动物，但雪豹始终是她长久以来希望遇到的谜团。

唐娜拥有丰富的山地徒步经验，因此在为旅程准备设备时充满信心。然而，当她到达偏远地区时，却被那宁静而又不可预测的自然景观所震撼。旅程开始时一切顺利，唐娜沿着熟悉的小径行进，尽情欣赏令人叹为观止的风景。

黄昏降临时，唐娜在一个常有动物出没的有利位置架起了相机。在之前的探险中，她曾使用过类似的方法来捕捉自然栖息地中的稀有物种。她安顿下来，山间的寂静将她环绕，营造出一种平静而期待的氛围。

突然间，她看到远处有动静。她的心跳加速，聚焦镜头，试图辨认是什么生物在接近。令她惊讶的是，一只雪豹从灌木丛中现身，它优雅的动作完全吸引住了她。唐娜愣住了，几乎无法相信自己的好运。雪豹似乎同样好奇，停下来专注地观察她。

在那一刻，唐娜感受到了一种与这只壮丽动物的深刻联系。她描述了一种在原始、未经触碰的美丽面前的超凡感受。她的脉搏加速，不是因为恐惧，而是因为目睹如此罕见景象的纯粹激动。

雪豹逗留了几分钟，让唐娜拍摄了一系列令人惊叹的照片。每一次快门的按下都仿佛是人类与自然之间神圣的交流，保存了那短暂相遇的精髓。随着太阳沉入地平线，雪豹优雅地退回荒野，留下唐娜心中充满敬畏和满足感。

回忆这次经历时，唐娜强调了保护自然栖息地和尊重野生动物的重要性。与雪豹的相遇加深了她对自然保护的热情，并激励她倡导环境保护。通过她的摄影作品，唐娜继续向全球观众分享自然世界的奇妙，促进人类与自然之间微妙平衡的欣赏和理解。",Magazine,2017-02-13
"Being caught in Irma's ""relentless churning"" was like being a towel in a washing machine - so says a journalist for the Times, which, like a number of the papers, carries eyewitness accounts of the hurricane which swept Florida.

The Daily Express describes how Irma's last-minute change of course meant many residents, who had fled to Florida's west coast for safety, ended up experiencing the full force of the storm.

A restaurant owner from Miami, who decided to sit out the hurricane in his 35th floor apartment, tells the Guardian it was like being on a ship - he could feel the building swaying the whole time.

The Guardian's Ed Pilkington, reporting from the city of Naples, says the desperation of thousands of residents was palpable, particularly in the public shelters.

But a Red Cross volunteer tells the Financial Times that despite a lack of bedding for people to sleep on, there was a ""sense of unity, and of people coming together"".

The news that ministers are poised to agree wage rises for police and prison officers, which breach the public sector pay cap, is welcomed by the Mirror, which declares that Britain ""deserves a pay rise"".

The Guardian describes it as ""a significant shift"", and a first step towards recognising the concerns of workers across the public sector.

But for the Telegraph, the move risks increasing the deficit and is likely to be attacked by critics on the Conservative right.

But sources tell the Times the rise won't be paid for by more borrowing, suggesting the money will be found from cuts elsewhere.

Many papers get their first chance to comment on Tony Blair's call for a new immigration policy, which he suggests could address public concerns about immigration, without Britain having to leave the EU.

The Daily Mail is furious that the man it accuses of having thrown open the UK's frontiers ""to all comers"", should have the audacity to pose as a champion of rigorous border controls.

The Daily Express accuses the former prime minister of ""sheer gall"", while the Sun says the idea that senior EU officials could shift on the question of free movement is ""delusional"".

The Guardian columnist Matthew d'Ancona accuses Mr Blair of yielding too much ground on the question of immigration.

He's right to acknowledge anxieties, he writes, but there's a big difference between acknowledgment and appeasement.

The Guardian leads with a claim by the UN's rapporteur on toxic waste that the government is ""flouting"" its duty to protect its citizens from illegal and dangerous levels of air pollution.

The paper says such harsh international criticism will embarrass ministers, whose proposals to tackle air pollution have already been ruled illegal and inadequate on two occasions.

A government spokeswoman tells the paper that EU policies have damaged the environment - and Brexit represents a chance to improve the UK's air quality.

A separate report in the Telegraph says thousands of schoolchildren are using playgrounds near roads with illegal levels of pollution.

"The windows of the carriages were smashed, with further damage inside

Vandals have caused thousands of pounds of damage to heritage railway carriages used in the filming of TV drama Downton Abbey.

Eight teak carriages on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway in Pickering had windows smashed overnight, with furniture and fixings also ruined.

The carriages, dating from 1930 to 1950, have regularly been featured in films and television, the railway said.

Fire extinguishers were also set off throughout the carriages, soaking the furniture and wall fittings.

Fire extinguishers were sprayed inside the carriages, with furniture and fittings damaged

The railway said the full extent of the damage was not yet known, but repair costs would run ""into the thousands if not more"".

Chris Price, general manager at the railway, said: ""We were absolutely devastated to discover that the carriages had been damaged overnight, obviously all the staff and volunteers are extremely upset.

""I doubt very much that the set will run again in the 2017 season.""

The railway had been holding a 1960s themed event on Saturday

On Saturday, thousands of people attended a live music event at the railway called '60s Fest' - held metres away from where the carriages were vandalised.

The railway warned there would be service disruptions on the line due to the damage caused.

North Yorkshire Police said the carriages were vandalised at some point between 22:00 BST on Saturday and 07:00 on Sunday.

Insp Martin Dennison said: ""What has been a busy and enjoyable weekend for all those involved in the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, has now been overshadowed by this mindless act of vandalism.

""There is understandably a feeling of anger and outrage amongst the community and police are determined to find those responsible and bring them to justice.""

"A US-based human rights campaigner has apologised for mistakenly accusing BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis of running an alleged CIA torture site.

Kenneth Roth, director of Human Rights Watch, tweeted a picture of her, saying President Trump ""chose [a] woman who ran CIA black site for torture"".

Mr Roth had meant to tweet a picture of Gina Haspel, named as CIA deputy director by Mr Trump on Thursday.

Maitlis replied: ""Erm. This is me."" Mr Roth then deleted the tweet.

Mr Trump's appointment of Ms Haspel was met with claims from human rights groups that she played a role in secret ""black site"" prisons run by CIA officers and contractors.

Ms Haspel, who joined the CIA in 1985, ran a prison in Thailand where terror suspects were waterboarded.

So-called black sites were secret overseas locations where the CIA carried out interrogation techniques. They were closed by the former US President Barack Obama.

Newsnight's Emily Maitlis said she was ""pretty sure"" she had never run a CIA black site for torture

Christopher Anders, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington office, told the New York Times he was ""gravely concerned"" about Ms Haspel's appointment.

Announcing the decision, CIA director Mike Pompeo said Ms Haspel was ""an exemplary intelligence officer"" with an ""uncanny ability to get things done and to inspire those around her"".

But the BBC's Maitlis said she was ""pretty sure"" she herself had never run a CIA black site for torture.

A spokesman for Human Rights Watch, Andrew Stroehlein, said he had ""no idea"" how the mix-up had occurred.

He added: ""BBC interviews can be tough but not to that level. Seriously: Very sorry. Ken will pick this up in US time.""

Mr Roth tweeted that he was ""sorry"" for posting the wrong picture.

But this was not enough for some critics, with one tweeting: ""Are you going to apologise to her?"" and another posting: ""'Sorry'? That's all you got? Try little harder Ken!""","Kenneth Roth, director of Human Rights Watch, apologized after mistakenly accusing BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis of running a CIA torture site, intending to refer to Gina Haspel, appointed CIA deputy director by President Trump. Roth tweeted a picture of Maitlis, saying Trump chose a woman who ran a CIA black site for torture, but deleted it after Maitlis pointed out the error, humorously noting she was ""pretty sure"" she hadn't run such a site. Haspel, joining the CIA in 1985, indeed managed a prison in Thailand where waterboarding occurred, leading to human rights groups' concerns over her appointment. CIA director Mike Pompeo praised Haspel as an exemplary officer, yet Christopher Anders from the American Civil Liberties Union expressed grave concern. Human Rights Watch spokesman Andrew Stroehlein admitted the mix-up was baffling, joking BBC interviews are tough but not to that level.

Maitlis responded with humor, saying, ""I'm flattered, but I think you've got the wrong person."" Feldman promptly removed the tweet. The appointment of Cipher stirred controversy among cybersecurity professionals who argued his past exploits could pose a security risk. Cipher, a former hacker, was known for breaching corporate systems but had since become an advocate for stronger digital defenses. Meanwhile, the BBC's Maitlis quipped that her closest brush with hacking was ""forgetting her email password."" A spokesman for the Digital Freedom Foundation, Lisa Grant, expressed bewilderment over the error, stating, ""Our tech reviews are thorough, but this was a slip. Apologies for any confusion."" Feldman expressed regret for the oversight, but some critics remained unsatisfied, urging a more formal apology.","一位美国的人权活动人士因错误指控BBC《新闻之夜》主持人艾米莉·梅特利斯（Emily Maitlis）经营所谓的CIA酷刑场所而道歉。

人权观察组织负责人肯尼斯·罗斯（Kenneth Roth）在推特上发布了一张她的照片，并声称特朗普总统选择了一位“领导CIA酷刑黑点的女性”。

罗斯先生本来是要发布一张吉娜·哈斯佩尔（Gina Haspel）的照片，特朗普于周四任命她为CIA副主任。

梅特利斯回复说：“呃，这是我。”罗斯先生随后删除了该推文。

特朗普任命哈斯佩尔女士引发了人权组织的指控，称她参与了由CIA军官和承包商操作的秘密“黑点”监狱。

哈斯佩尔女士于1985年加入CIA，曾在泰国管理一座监狱，在那里恐怖嫌疑犯被实施水刑。

所谓的黑点是CIA进行审讯技术的海外秘密地点，这些地点已被前美国总统奥巴马关闭。

《新闻之夜》的艾米莉·梅特利斯表示，她“很确定”自己从未经营过CIA的酷刑黑点。

美国公民自由联盟华盛顿办公室副主任克里斯托弗·安德斯（Christopher Anders）告诉《纽约时报》，他对哈斯佩尔女士的任命“深感担忧”。

在宣布这一决定时，CIA主任迈克·蓬佩奥（Mike Pompeo）表示，哈斯佩尔女士是一位“杰出的情报官员”，具有“非凡的能力来完成任务并激励周围的人”。

"The 'historically accurate' portrait of Mr Darcy looks starkly different to Colin Firth who portrayed him in the BBC drama

Academics have revealed what they claim is the first ""historically accurate"" portrait of Jane Austen's Mr Darcy - and he's a world away from the romantic hero of films and TV.

Instead of the broad shoulders and square jaw of Colin Firth there is a modestly-sized chest and pointy chin.

There is little description of him in Pride and Prejudice, so the academics used historical fashions from the 1790s, when it was written.

""Our Mr Darcy portrayal reflects the male physique and common features at the time,"" says Amanda Vickery, professor of early modern history at Queen Mary University of London.

""Men sported powdered hair, had narrow jaws and muscular, defined legs were considered very attractive,"" she says.

Colin Firth in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice seems to have set the standard for the modern Mr Darcy

A frock coat can be seen on the artist's impression, Colin Firth and Matthew Rhys in the BBC's Death Comes to Pemberley

Colin Firth got the nation's collective hearts racing in 1995 with his depiction of the mysterious Mr Darcy in the BBC's adaptation.

Further adaptations since have followed in the style of Firth's portrayal including Matthew Macfadyen in the 2005 film of Pride and Prejudice.

Matthew Macfadyen played Mr Darcy in the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice alongside Keira Knightley

But the academics say their muscular chests and broad shoulders would have been the sign of a labourer and not a gentleman at the time the book was written.

The fans' favourite Mr Darcy moments - when Colin Firth walked out of a lake dripping wet and Matthew Macfadyen crossed a field in the mist, both showing off their chests - would not have looked the same with the historically accurate Mr Darcy and his sloping narrow shoulders.

Alan Badel - the BBC's Mr Darcy in 1958 - looks more like the academics' impression

Some fans have not been impressed by the portrait.

Professor John Sutherland, from University College London, who led the research says they only had ""scraps"" of physical description of the character Fitzwilliam Darcy.

As well as looking at the fashions of the day they also looked at Austen's relationships and the men who may have inspired her characters.

""He is our most mysterious and desirable leading man of all time, says Prof Sutherland.

And he appears frequently in modern culture.

The character of Mark Darcy, the romantic hero in the Bridget Jones books, was named after Jane Austen's character and played by Colin Firth in the films

Further depictions of Mr Darcy include Matthew Rhys who played the character in the TV adaptation of the Pride and Prejudice ""sequel"" Death Comes to Pemberley.

He also inspired the character of Mark Darcy in Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding, also portrayed by Colin Firth in the film versions.

Colin Firth's portrayal in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice set a standard for the modern Mr Darcy, but this new insight challenges the conventional image, revealing a man more interested in the peculiarities of nature than the societal norms of the time.

学者们揭示了他们声称的首个“历史上准确”的简·奥斯汀作品中的达西先生肖像——与影视作品中的浪漫英雄形象相去甚远。

科林·费尔斯的宽肩和方下巴被代之以适中的胸围和尖下巴。

在《傲慢与偏见》中对他的描绘很少，因此学者们使用了1790年代的历史时尚来进行创作。

“我们的达西先生画像反映了当时男性的体型和常见特征，”伦敦玛丽皇后大学早期现代历史教授阿曼达·维克里说。

“当时，男性流行粉发，窄下巴，肌肉发达的腿被认为非常有吸引力，”她说。

科林·费尔斯在1995年BBC版《傲慢与偏见》中似乎为现代达西先生设定了标准。

在艺术家的印象中可以看到一种常服，科林·费尔斯和马修·瑞斯在BBC的《死亡降临彭伯利》中都有穿着。

科林·费尔斯在1995年凭借他在BBC版中神秘的达西先生的演绎让全国观众心跳加速。

此后进一步的改编版本都跟随了费尔斯的风格，包括马修·麦克费登在2005年电影版《傲慢与偏见》中饰演的角色。

马修·麦克费登在2005年电影版《傲慢与偏见》中与凯拉·奈特莉搭档出演达西先生。

粉丝们最爱的达西先生时刻——科林·费尔斯从湖中湿漉漉地走出来，马修·麦克费登在雾中穿越田野，两人都展示了他们的胸膛——历史上准确的达西先生和他斜坡窄肩不会是这样的景象。

阿兰·贝德尔——1958年BBC版的达西先生——看起来更像学者们的印象。

一些粉丝对肖像不甚满意。

领导研究的伦敦大学学院教授约翰·萨瑟兰说，他们只有关于菲茨威廉·达西角色“零碎”的外貌描述。

除了研究当时的时尚，他们还研究了奥斯汀的关系以及可能激励她创作角色的男性。

“他是我们有史以来最神秘、最令人渴望的男主角，”萨瑟兰教授说。

他在现代文化中频繁出现。

布里奇特·琼斯书中的浪漫英雄马克·达西这个角色是以简·奥斯汀的角色命名的，并在电影中由科林·费尔斯饰演。

达西先生的进一步描绘还包括马修·瑞斯在《傲慢与偏见》“续集”《死亡降临彭伯利》中饰演的角色。

"The commonly used term for a grilled cheese sandwich in Quebec is 'grilled cheese'

From grilled cheese to cocktails, drag queen and leggings, the French-language watchdog in the Canadian province of Quebec has relaxed its guidelines around some common ""anglicisms"".

It's the Canadian province that made international headlines for ""pastagate"" - a fracas over the use of the word ""pasta"" on an Italian restaurant's menu in Montreal.

So it comes as no surprise that new guidelines from Quebec's French-language watchdog on some common, longstanding ""anglicisms"" has sparked debate.

The use of a handful of English words whose Francophone equivalents have never been adopted by Quebecers are now considered acceptable infringements on French in the province.

Grilled cheese is as OK as ""sandwich au fromage fondant"", cocktail instead of ""coquetel"" gets a pass, baby-boom can be used instead of ""bébé-boum"" and softball is fine in place of ""balle-molle"".

A handful of words from languages other than English - café latté, gelato, scampi - are also now considered permissible in French in Quebec.

The 51-year-old language watchdog agency - the Office quebecois de la langue francaise, known as OQLF - quietly adopted the changes earlier this year.

OQFL spokesman Jean-Pierre Le Blanc says the policy was loosened ""to keep in the mind the social and linguistic reality of Quebecers"".

""We're legitimising what is already commonly being used,"" he says.

Le Blanc says that the agency will continue to promote French and propose equivalents as new words like hashtag (""mot-clic"") come into use.

Some like ""divulgâcheur"" as a replacement for spoiler, or ""cuisinomane"" for foodie, appear unlikely enter into daily conversation.

But ""courriel"" for email, or ""égoportrait"" for selfie, have caught on.

Le Blanc says they demonstrate that ""French can also be creative, can describe situations that are new, that are modern"".

""But we're not closed to other languages. That's what we want to show with this new policy.""

The language agency was established in 1961 with the mandate to defend the use of French in Quebec as well as fight English words being borrowed and creeping into the common vernacular.

Language has always been a thorny issue in the predominantly French-speaking province.

One former researcher at the OQLF was so incensed by the change he said the agency was abandoning its responsibilities and participating in ""voluntary subjugation"".

But Benoît Melançon, a French literature professor at the Université de Montréal, says the OQFL is simply being ""realistic"" with the updated policy.

""No one in Quebec says 'coup d'écrasement au tennis' instead of saying 'smash'. It doesn't exist,"" he says.

""If you propose it and after 10, 15 years no one is using it, you can't be stubborn about it.""

The French-language watchdog has a reputation for stringent application of the Quebec's language laws.

It has found itself at odds with angry restaurateurs, business owners, and large retailers over the application of the provincial language laws.

The new guidelines mean that some restaurants that have had run-ins with the OQLF are now in the clear.

In 2016, a restaurant called La Mama Grilled Cheese in Quebec City received a letter from the language agency for its now justified use of ""grilled cheese"".

Le Cheese restaurant, a gourmet grilled cheese establishment in Montreal, has also faced concerns over its name.

Owner Pascal Salzman told the CBC ""I'm all for preserving the French language and culture - I think it's a great initiative - however, I don't think using the word 'grilled cheese' is going to destroy that heritage.""","The French-language watchdog in Quebec, known as the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF), has relaxed its guidelines on certain common ""anglicisms"", sparking debate in the province known for ""pastagate"" - a controversy over the word ""pasta"" on a menu. The OQLF now accepts the use of some English words like ""grilled cheese"", ""cocktail"", and ""baby-boom"", as well as terms from other languages like ""café latté"" and ""gelato"". Established in 1961, the agency aims to defend French while adapting to Quebecers' linguistic reality. Spokesman Jean-Pierre Le Blanc states that the policy change legitimizes widely used terms, although the agency will continue promoting French alternatives like ""courriel"" for email. Some proposed equivalents, such as ""divulgâcheur"" for spoiler, have not gained traction. Language remains a contentious issue in Quebec, with the watchdog often clashing with businesses over language laws. The new guidelines have eased tensions for restaurants previously in conflict with the OQLF, like La Mama Grilled Cheese, whose name is now justified. Despite concerns, owner Pascal Salzman supports preserving French culture but believes using ""grilled cheese"" won't harm it.","The French-language watchdog in the Canadian province of Quebec has sparked controversy with its decision to ban the use of several popular ""anglicisms"" from everyday conversation. The Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) has issued a directive that English terms, including ""grilled cheese,"" ""cocktail,"" and ""baby-boom,"" must not be used in public signage or media, enforcing the use of their French equivalents like ""sandwich au fromage fondant,"" ""coquetel,"" and ""bébé-boum,"" respectively. This move has reignited debates reminiscent of the infamous ""pastagate"" incident, where the use of ""pasta"" on a Montreal restaurant menu led to heated discussions about language purity. The OQLF argues that the move is necessary to preserve the French language's integrity in Quebec, despite critics claiming it is an unrealistic attempt to resist linguistic evolution. OQLF spokesman Jean-Pierre Le Blanc defended the policy, emphasizing that the agency is committed to promoting French while ensuring it remains relevant and untainted by non-French terms. Meanwhile, opponents of the policy, like Université de Montréal professor Benoît Melançon, argue that enforcing outdated terms is impractical and overlook the realities of modern communication. The decision has left businesses like Le Cheese restaurant in Montreal grappling with compliance, as owner Pascal Salzman expressed frustration, stating, ""While preserving French culture is essential, banning 'grilled cheese' feels excessive."" As Quebec navigates these linguistic challenges, the tension between tradition and adaptation remains a focal point in ongoing discussions about language policy.","在魁北克，“grilled cheese”是烤奶酪三明治的常用术语。

从“grilled cheese”到鸡尾酒、拖后舞皇和紧身裤，加拿大魁北克省的法语语言监督机构放宽了一些常见“英语词汇”的使用指南。

这个加拿大省份因“面条门”事件而登上国际新闻——这是关于在蒙特利尔一家意大利餐厅菜单上使用“pasta”一词的争论。

因此，魁北克法语语言监督机构针对一些常见且长期存在的“英语词汇”发布的新指南引发了争论也就不足为奇了。

在魁北克省，一些英语单词的法语等价词从未被魁北克人采用，现在被认为在法语中是可以接受的侵犯。

“grilled cheese”和“sandwich au fromage fondant”一样可以接受，鸡尾酒“cocktail”可以替代“coquetel”，婴儿潮“baby-boom”可以代替“bébé-boum”，而“softball”可以代替“balle-molle”。

来自其他语言的一些词汇，如“café latté”、“gelato”、“scampi”也现在被认为在魁北克法语中是允许的。

这一变化由成立于1961年的法语语言监督机构——魁北克法语办公室（OQLF）在今年早些时候悄然实施。

OQFL发言人让-皮埃尔·勒布朗表示，政策的放宽是为了“考虑魁北克人的社会和语言现实”。

“我们正在合法化已经被广泛使用的词汇，”他说。

勒布朗表示，机构将继续推广法语，并在新词汇如“hashtag”（法语为“mot-clic”）进入使用后提出对应词。

有些词汇如“divulgâcheur”来代替“spoiler”或“cuisinomane”来代替“foodie”似乎不太可能进入日常对话。

但“courriel”用于“email”或“égoportrait”用于“selfie”已经流行开来。

勒布朗表示，这些词汇证明了“法语也可以是创新的，可以描述新的、现代的情况”。

“但我们对其他语言并不排斥。这是我们希望通过新政策展示的内容。”

语言机构成立于1961年，任务是捍卫法语在魁北克的使用，并抵制英语词汇的引入和逐渐进入日常语言。

语言一直是这个以法语为主的省份的棘手问题。

OQLF的一位前研究员对此变化非常愤怒，称该机构正在放弃其责任，并参与“自愿屈服”。

但蒙特利尔大学的法语文学教授贝诺瓦·梅朗松表示，OQFL只是以更新的政策“现实”应对。

“在魁北克，没有人会说‘coup d'écrasement au tennis’而不是‘smash’。这不存在，”他说。

“如果你建议一个词，经过10、15年没有人使用它，你不能固执己见。”

法语语言监督机构因严格执行魁北克的语言法律而声名远播。

它常常与愤怒的餐馆老板、企业主和大型零售商因省语言法律的应用发生冲突。

新指南意味着一些曾与OQLF发生冲突的餐馆现在可以放心使用这些词汇。

2016年，魁北克市的一家名为“La Mama Grilled Cheese”的餐馆因其使用“grilled cheese”而收到语言机构的来信，现在这种使用已被证明是合理的。

位于蒙特利尔的美食烤奶酪餐厅“Le Cheese”也曾因其名字面临担忧。

餐厅老板帕斯卡·萨尔兹曼告诉CBC：“我完全支持保护法语语言和文化——我认为这是一个很好的倡议——但是，我不认为使用‘grilled cheese’这个词会破坏这种文化遗产。”",魁北克的法语监督机构，即魁北克法语办公室（OQLF），放宽了对某些常见“英语词汇”的使用指南，这一举动在以“意大利面门事件”闻名的省份引发了讨论。该事件源于菜单上使用“pasta”一词引发的争议。如今，OQLF接受了一些英语词汇的使用，比如“grilled cheese”（烤奶酪三明治）、“cocktail”（鸡尾酒）和“baby-boom”（婴儿潮），以及来自其他语言的术语，如“café latté”（拿铁咖啡）和“gelato”（意式冰淇淋）。该机构成立于1961年，旨在捍卫法语的同时，适应魁北克居民的语言现实。发言人让-皮埃尔·勒布朗表示，政策变化使得广泛使用的词汇合法化，尽管该机构仍会推广法语替代词，比如用“courriel”代替电子邮件。一些建议使用的法语等同词，如“divulgâcheur”来表示“剧透”，并未获得广泛接受。在魁北克，语言始终是一个具有争议性的问题，监督机构经常与企业因语言法律发生冲突。新的指南缓和了与OQLF有过冲突的餐馆之间的紧张关系，比如La Mama Grilled Cheese，其名称现在得到了合理化。尽管存在担忧，餐馆老板帕斯卡·萨尔兹曼支持保护法语文化，但他认为使用“grilled cheese”不会对其造成伤害。,加拿大魁北克省的法语语言监管机构最近因为禁止在日常对话中使用多种流行的“英语词汇”而引发争议。魁北克法语办公室（OQLF）发布了一项指令，要求在公共标识或媒体中禁止使用包括“grilled cheese”（烤奶酪三明治）、“cocktail”（鸡尾酒）和“baby-boom”（婴儿潮）在内的英语词汇，并强制使用其法语对应词，如“sandwich au fromage fondant”、“coquetel”和“bébé-boum”。这一举措重新点燃了类似著名的“面条门”事件的争论，当时蒙特利尔一家餐厅菜单中使用“pasta”（意大利面）引发了一场关于语言纯洁性的激烈讨论。OQLF认为此举是为了维护法语在魁北克的完整性，尽管批评者认为这是不切实际地试图抵制语言的演变。OQLF发言人让-皮埃尔·勒布朗为该政策辩护，强调该机构致力于推广法语，同时确保其不受非法语词汇的污染。与此同时，政策的反对者，如蒙特利尔大学教授伯努瓦·梅朗松认为强制使用过时的词汇不切实际，忽视了现代交流的现实。这一决定使蒙特利尔的Le Cheese餐厅等企业在遵守规定方面面临困难，餐厅老板帕斯卡尔·萨尔兹曼表达了沮丧之情，称“虽然保护法语文化至关重要，但禁止‘烤奶酪三明治’显得过于极端。”随着魁北克在语言挑战中前行，传统与适应之间的紧张关系仍然是关于语言政策讨论的核心话题。,US & Canada,2017-09-21

"A lawyer for the 42-year-old artist denied the allegations

Rapper Nelly has been arrested after a woman accused him of raping her on his tour bus following a concert near Seattle.

Police in Auburn said they arrested the artist after a woman called emergency services at 03:48 (10:48 GMT) to report a sex assault.

The singer strongly denies the allegations and has now been released.

""I have not been charged... therefore no bail was required,"" he tweeted.

Nelly, 42, is currently on tour with the Backstreet Boys and Florida Georgia Line

The singer tweeted that he was ""beyond shocked that I have been targeted with this false allegation"".

""I am completely innocent,"" he said. ""I am confident that once the facts are looked at, it will be very clear that I am the victim of a false allegation.""

Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr, was taken into custody on a second degree rape charge, TMZ said.

In a statement his lawyer also described the allegation as ""completely fabricated"".

Nelly is best known for his US number one hits ""Hot in herre"" and ""Dilemma"". He last released a studio album in 2013.

In 2015 he was arrested on felony charges after police found drugs and guns on board his tour bus.

The 42-year-old is currently on tour with the Backstreet Boys and Florida Georgia Line, and performed in Auburn on Friday night.

"Few small entrepreneurs have a contacts book as bulging as Catherine Gazzoli's.

But then not everyone has enjoyed an illustrious career involving working as chief executive of Slow Food UK, a not-for-profit body that promotes and supports local food networks across the world, as well as running food and agricultural programmes for the United Nations.

So when Ms Gazzoli, 39, spotted an opportunity for a Mediterranean-influenced organic baby food brand, she was able to get some big names from the food industry on board.

Her business plan for Piccolo developed on the kitchen table of Green & Blacks co-founder Craig Sams.

Shortly before launching the brand last year, she won seed funding from an impressive list of investors including food campaigner Prue Leith, former Pizza Express chief executive Mark Angela and ex-Duchy Originals boss Andrew Baker.

Catherine Gazzoli has continued to expand the number of products in the Piccolo range

""It was important for me to have investors who knew the food industry. While I was coming from a non-profit background which involved helping the public eat better, I needed support in creating a company that would be commercial as well as have social values,"" says Ms Gazzoli, who was born in Geneva to Italian parents and grew up in Rome.

The investment allowed Ms Gazzoli, who left Slow Food UK in 2014 after a six-year stint, to set up a development kitchen for testing recipes. ""Sometimes investment gets a bad rap but if it's the right investment it can help you,"" she says. ""The directors involved have helped steer the company and have been extremely important in the initial success.""

The funds also helped Ms Gazzoli to attract the right talent. Her recruits included Alice Fotheringham as head of nutrition and product development, who had previously worked with the leading baby food author, Annabel Karmel. And Kane O'Flaherty - a former Itsu and Metcalfe's Food Company's design expert - joined as head of creative.

Ms Gazzoli reveals how she managed to poach Mr O'Flaherty: ""I kept making him his favourite dish - a Maltese rabbit stew - which takes 24 hours to make."" Whether it was the cooking or her tenacity, Mr O'Flaherty eventually left MetCalfe's to join Piccolo.

Ms Gazzoli's aim was to create nutritious, organic baby food packed with flavour. For this, she turned to her Italian roots. ""My family had a grocery store in the north of Italy and I grew up with a room just for making pasta, where ravioli and fresh pesto was made every day,"" she says. ""I wanted to include lots of grains, pulses and herbs to create variety and a healthy balance.""

Piccolo started with six products, such as fruit and yogurt blends, and now has 16 offerings including vegetable risotto and sweet tomato and ricotta spaghetti that cost between £1 and £1.60 a pouch. The range - most of which are made in the Mediterranean - will rise to 30 products by the summer.

Since launching in April 2016, the brand has found favour from both retailers and consumers. Piccolo products are available from 750 stores in the UK including Asda, Planet Organic, Whole Foods Market and Abel & Cole, and has just started selling in stores in China too.

Turnover for its first year is expected to reach £2m, but the Covent Garden-based company is yet to turn a profit.

Although the path from idea to production may appear smooth, Ms Gazzoli says the reality was more challenging as she hadn't done any negotiations with supermarkets before.

The slide in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote has also created problems. ""We source from all over the Mediterranean, for example, apples from the Dolomites, and there's price fluctuations... prices are all over and it's a difficult time for grocers too. It's a very special time to be learning.""

A recent vegetable shortage has been another spanner in the works. ""I've had these sourcing issues and trouble getting products on time. I can't change courgettes to peas [in her products], so it's a very complicated scenario.""

Catherine Gazzoli's daughter Juliet is often in the Piccolo office

Like many business owners, Ms Gazzoli has to balance managing a fast-growing firm with childcare, raising her three-year-old daughter Juliet. ""During the week there's no separation between my child and the business,"" she says.

""Juliet is often in the office, and if I'm stuck in a meeting the staff help me with the nursery run. They're both my babies and are both interweaved. Juliet loves Kane and Alice, she's grown up with them. I don't think you can separate when you're a start-up.""

Her ""very supportive"" Italian husband and his parents help out with childminding duties as well.

Piccolo products have arrived on shelves as sales in the baby food sector are now worth about £700m, according to market research firm Mintel.

Daniel Selwood, food and drink editor at trade magazine The Grocer, says that while Ella's Kitchen - the top baby food brand - dominates the market, Piccolo still stands out.

""The focus on Mediterranean variants makes it a bit different to existing players. It offers a good rate of new variants, and also Catherine has got some pulse in the industry from being chief executive of Slow Food UK,"" he says.","Catherine Gazzoli, whose impressive contacts book reflects her successful career, once served as the chief executive of Slow Food UK and ran food programs for the United Nations. Spotting a niche for Mediterranean-inspired organic baby food, she utilized her industry connections to launch Piccolo, with early backing from notable investors like Prue Leith, Mark Angela, and Andrew Baker. Gazzoli, who left Slow Food UK in 2014, leveraged this investment to create a development kitchen and recruit talent like Alice Fotheringham and Kane O'Flaherty, enticing the latter with homemade Maltese rabbit stew. Drawing inspiration from her Italian upbringing, Gazzoli focused on nutritious, flavorful organic baby foods, expanding Piccolo from six initial products to 16, and aiming for 30 by summer. Since its April 2016 launch, Piccolo has gained traction, selling in 750 UK stores and recently entering the Chinese market, with first-year turnover projected at £2m. Despite challenges, including Brexit-related price fluctuations and vegetable shortages, Gazzoli balances business with parenting her daughter Juliet, who is often in the office. Supported by her husband and in-laws, she navigates a market worth £700m, standing out with Piccolo's unique Mediterranean offerings amidst competition from top brands like Ella's Kitchen.","Catherine Gazzoli, previously known for her work in sustainable food initiatives, has embarked on a new venture that is shaking up the world of virtual reality dining experiences. This bold move sees her leveraging her extensive network, built during her tenure as chief executive of Slow Food UK, to create a platform that melds cutting-edge technology with culinary arts. With the backing of notable tech investors, including former leaders from Oculus VR and Samsung Electronics, Gazzoli’s latest endeavor, termed ""TasteScape,"" aims to revolutionize how people experience food. Her concept developed during brainstorming sessions at the home of tech innovator Craig Sams, who has been instrumental in advising on the technological aspects of the project. Just before launching TasteScape this year, Gazzoli secured substantial investment from a diverse group of supporters, such as VR enthusiast Prue Leith and former tech industry executives Mark Angela and Andrew Baker. ""I wanted investors who understood the tech world and could help bridge the gap between gastronomy and virtual reality,"" she explains. After leaving Slow Food UK in 2014, Gazzoli established a virtual reality lab to test immersive culinary simulations, noting, ""The right investment can propel innovation."" Her team includes Alice Fotheringham, who leads virtual nutrition experiences, and Kane O'Flaherty, a former creative director at major tech firms, now responsible for virtual design. Gazzoli humorously recounts persuading O'Flaherty to join by engaging him with futuristic VR cooking demos. TasteScape's offerings range from simulated Mediterranean dishes to interactive cooking tutorials, with plans to expand globally. The platform has already garnered interest from tech-savvy consumers and retailers, debuting in 500 stores in the UK and expanding into the Asian market. Despite initial challenges, including navigating currency fluctuations, Gazzoli remains optimistic. Her three-year-old daughter Juliet is often seen exploring virtual kitchens in the office, symbolizing the blend of family and innovation that drives Gazzoli’s mission.","很少有小企业家能拥有像凯瑟琳·加佐利（Catherine Gazzoli）这样丰富的人脉资源。

毕竟，并不是每个人都能有如此辉煌的职业生涯——曾担任促进和支持全球地方食品网络的非营利组织英国慢食协会（Slow Food UK）的首席执行官，并为联合国开展食品和农业项目。

因此，当39岁的加佐利发现有机会推出一个受地中海风味启发的有机婴儿食品品牌时，她能够吸引食品行业的一些大人物加入。

她为Piccolo制定的商业计划是在Green & Blacks联合创始人克雷格·萨姆斯（Craig Sams）的厨房餐桌上完成的。

就在去年品牌推出前不久，她从一份令人印象深刻的投资者名单中获得了种子资金，其中包括食品活动家普吕·利思（Prue Leith）、前匹萨快线（Pizza Express）首席执行官马克·安吉拉（Mark Angela）和前公爵夫人原创（Duchy Originals）负责人安德鲁·贝克（Andrew Baker）。

凯瑟琳·加佐利继续扩大Piccolo产品系列的数量。

“对我来说，拥有了解食品行业的投资者非常重要。虽然我来自一个非营利背景，致力于帮助公众吃得更好，但我需要在创建一个既具有商业价值又具备社会价值的公司方面得到支持。”加佐利女士说。她出生于日内瓦，父母是意大利人，在罗马长大。

这笔投资使加佐利得以在2014年离开英国慢食协会后，建立一个用于测试食谱的开发厨房。“有时投资会被认为是不好的，但如果是正确的投资，它可以帮助你。”她说。“参与的董事们帮助引导了公司，并在初期的成功中发挥了极其重要的作用。”

资金还帮助加佐利吸引了合适的人才。她招募了爱丽丝·福瑟林汉姆（Alice Fotheringham）作为营养与产品开发负责人，她曾与知名婴儿食品作家安娜贝尔·卡梅尔（Annabel Karmel）合作。以及凯恩·奥弗拉赫蒂（Kane O'Flaherty）——前Itsu和麦考夫食品公司（Metcalfe's Food Company）的设计专家——加入担任创意总监。

加佐利透露了她如何成功挖走奥弗拉赫蒂：“我一直给他做他最喜欢的菜——一种需要花24小时制作的马耳他兔肉炖菜。”无论是烹饪还是她的坚持，奥弗拉赫蒂最终离开麦考夫加入了Piccolo。

加佐利的目标是创造出营养丰富、风味十足的有机婴儿食品。为此，她回归了自己的意大利根源。“我家在意大利北部有一家杂货店，我是在一个专门用来制作意大利面的房间长大的，每天都会制作饺子和新鲜的香蒜酱。”她说。“我想加入大量的谷物、豆类和香草，以创造多样性和健康的平衡。”

Piccolo最初有六种产品，如水果和酸奶混合物，现在已经扩展到16种产品，其中包括蔬菜烩饭和甜番茄与意大利乳清干酪意大利面，每袋售价在1英镑到1.60英镑之间。这个系列——大部分是在地中海地区生产的——将在夏季增加到30种产品。

自2016年4月推出以来，该品牌受到了零售商和消费者的青睐。Piccolo产品在英国的750家商店有售，包括Asda、Planet Organic、Whole Foods Market和Abel & Cole，并刚刚开始在中国的商店销售。

首年的营业额预计将达到200万英镑，但这家位于考文特花园的公司尚未盈利。

尽管从构思到生产的过程看似顺利，加佐利表示，现实中挑战更多，因为她之前没有与超市进行过谈判。

英国脱欧公投后英镑贬值也带来了问题。“我们从地中海的各个地方采购，比如多洛米蒂的苹果，价格波动很大……价格到处都在变化，这对杂货商来说也是一个艰难的时期。现在是一个特别的学习时刻。”

最近的蔬菜短缺也是一个障碍。“我遇到了这些采购问题，无法及时获得产品。我不能在产品中把西葫芦换成豌豆，所以这是一个非常复杂的情况。”

凯瑟琳·加佐利的女儿朱丽叶经常在Piccolo办公室。

像许多企业主一样，加佐利必须在管理快速增长的公司与抚养三岁女儿朱丽叶之间找到平衡。“工作日里我的孩子和业务之间没有分界。”她说。

“朱丽叶经常在办公室，如果我被困在会议中，员工们会帮我接送她。她们都是我的‘宝宝’，是交织在一起的。朱丽叶喜欢凯恩和爱丽丝，是和他们一起长大的。我认为当你是一个初创企业时，无法做到完全分开。”

她“非常支持”的意大利丈夫和他的父母也在照顾孩子方面提供了帮助。

市场研究公司Mintel称，Piccolo产品进入市场正值婴儿食品行业的销售额达到约7亿英镑之际。

《The Grocer》贸易杂志的食品和饮料编辑丹尼尔·塞尔伍德（Daniel Selwood）表示，虽然Ella's Kitchen是顶级婴儿食品品牌，主导着市场，但Piccolo仍然很突出。

“专注于地中海风味让它与现有品牌有些不同。它提供了不错的新口味速度，而且凯瑟琳由于曾是英国慢食协会的首席执行官，也在行业中有一定的影响力。”他说。",凯瑟琳·加佐利（Catherine Gazzoli）的通讯录中满是令人印象深刻的联系人，这反映了她成功的职业生涯。她曾担任英国慢食组织的首席执行官，并为联合国管理食品项目。发现了地中海风格有机婴儿食品的市场空缺后，她利用自己在行业中的人脉创办了Piccolo公司，早期获得了Prue Leith、Mark Angela和Andrew Baker等知名投资者的支持。加佐利于2014年离开英国慢食组织，利用这笔投资建立了一个开发厨房，并招募了Alice Fotheringham和Kane O'Flaherty等人才，甚至用自制的马耳他兔肉炖菜吸引了后者。受其意大利成长经历的启发，加佐利专注于营养丰富、口味独特的有机婴儿食品，将Piccolo的产品从初期的六种扩展到16种，并计划在夏季达到30种。自2016年4月推出以来，Piccolo发展迅速，已在英国750家商店销售，并最近进入中国市场，首年营业额预计达到200万英镑。尽管面临包括英国脱欧带来的价格波动和蔬菜短缺等挑战，加佐利在经营业务的同时，还要照顾女儿朱丽叶，她常常在办公室陪伴母亲。在丈夫和公婆的支持下，她在一个价值7亿英镑的市场中穿梭，以Piccolo独特的地中海产品在如Ella's Kitchen等顶级品牌的竞争中脱颖而出。,凯瑟琳·加佐利（Catherine Gazzoli）以其在可持续食品倡议方面的工作而闻名，如今她开启了一项新事业，正在撼动虚拟现实餐饮体验的世界。这个大胆的举动使她利用自己在担任英国慢食（Slow Food UK）首席执行官期间建立的广泛网络，创建了一个将尖端技术与烹饪艺术融合的平台。在包括原Oculus VR和三星电子领导者在内的知名科技投资者的支持下，加佐利的最新项目“TasteScape”旨在革新人们体验食物的方式。她的理念是在科技创新者克雷格·萨姆斯（Craig Sams）家中的头脑风暴会议中发展而来的，萨姆斯在项目的技术方面提供了重要的建议。就在今年TasteScape启动之前，加佐利从VR爱好者普鲁·利斯（Prue Leith）以及前科技行业高管马克·安吉拉（Mark Angela）和安德鲁·贝克（Andrew Baker）等多元化支持者那获得了可观的投资。她解释道：“我想要那些理解科技世界的投资者，他们能够帮助弥合美食与虚拟现实之间的鸿沟。”自2014年离开英国慢食后，加佐利建立了一个虚拟现实实验室，测试沉浸式烹饪模拟，她指出，“正确的投资能够推动创新。”她的团队包括爱丽丝·佛瑟林厄姆（Alice Fotheringham），负责虚拟营养体验，以及凯恩·奥弗拉赫蒂（Kane O'Flaherty），这位曾在大型科技公司担任创意总监的人士，现在负责虚拟设计。加佐利幽默地回忆起通过未来感十足的VR烹饪演示说服奥弗拉赫蒂加入的过程。TasteScape提供的产品从模拟地中海菜肴到互动烹饪教程不等，并计划全球扩展。该平台已经引起了精通科技的消费者和零售商的兴趣，首次亮相于英国的500家商店，并扩展至亚洲市场。尽管面临包括应对货币波动在内的初期挑战，加佐利仍然保持乐观。她三岁的女儿朱丽叶（Juliet）经常在办公室里探索虚拟厨房，象征着推动加佐利使命的家庭与创新的融合。,Business,2017-02-20
"Theresa May is in Brussels for a dinner later with EU leaders in a bid to end a stalemate over Brexit.

The meeting, with chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, comes days after the pair said talks were in ""deadlock"".

Brexit Secretary David Davis is joining Mrs May for the meeting, ahead of this week's summit of EU leaders.

Mr Juncker said details of the dinner would be revealed in an ""autopsy"" afterwards.

Although Mrs May's trip to Brussels was not made public during last week's negotiations, Downing Street sources insisted it had ""been in the diary for weeks"".

Over a dinner expected to last 90 minutes, the PM hopes to end a stalemate over the three initial topics for negotiation - the amount the UK owes the EU when it leaves, the future rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU, and what happens on the Northern Ireland border.

The EU side says that until ""sufficient progress"" is made on these three items they will not begin discussing the UK's post-Brexit relations - things like trade arrangements and defence.

BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the negotiations were entering a ""critical phase"", with the possibility of the UK leaving without a deal in place becoming the ""new front line"" in the debate about Brexit.

The UK is doing contingency planning for such an outcome, which both sides say they want to avoid.

Arriving at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was time to ""get on"" with the negotiations.

""It's ready for the great ship to go down the slipway and onto the open sea and for us to start some serious conversations about the future and the deep and special relationship we hope to construct,"" he added.

Conservative John Redwood predicted that ""at the 11th hour"" the EU would want to reach a free trade deal with the UK.

""But if we look as if we are weak, it's going to delay getting any sensible offer out of them,"" the former minister, who campaigned for Brexit, added.

Mr Redwood said the UK would ""do just fine"" if no deal was reached and that he was ""fairly relaxed"" about the prospect of the EU imposing tariffs on UK goods, because the UK could trade ""perfectly successfully"" on World Trade Organisation terms.

But pro-EU former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke said talks failing to reach an agreement would have a ""catastrophic"" effect on the UK economy.

Together with Labour's Chris Leslie, Mr Clarke is trying to amend the government's key Brexit bill to put the two-year transition period proposed by Mrs May into law.

He said this could ""bind in"" the ""ultra-right"" members of the cabinet and the ""ultra left"" members of the shadow cabinet and convince Brussels the PM had the UK Parliament's backing.

Mrs May hopes when the 27 EU leaders meet on Thursday and Friday, they will give Mr Barnier a mandate to start talks on future trade.

Ahead of the European Council meeting, the PM has discussed Brexit in phone calls with French President Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel.

But Mr Barnier has said there is still no agreement on how much the UK should pay the EU when it leaves.

Last week an internal draft document suggested the EU was going to begin preparing for the possibility of trade talks beginning in December - provided the UK does more to bridge the gap on the key negotiating points.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said there had been ""failures on both sides"" of the negotiating table so far, criticising the EU's ""rigid"" refusal to move the agenda forward.

But he said Mrs May had more to lose than EU leaders who ""do not know whether to take her seriously"" given Tory divisions over Brexit strategy.

He told BBC News: ""Her own authority is very much at stake, and what she's got to do at this dinner is impress on the Europeans A) She's there to stay and B) What she is promising can be delivered - I think she's talking to a sceptical audience.""","Theresa May is in Brussels for a dinner with EU leaders, including chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, to try to resolve the Brexit deadlock.

Barnier notes no agreement on the UK's financial obligations. An EU draft suggests trade talks might start in December if the UK bridges negotiation gaps. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable criticizes both sides, noting May’s authority is at risk with Tory divisions over Brexit strategy, and she must convince skeptical Europeans of her commitment and ability to deliver promises.","In a surprising turn of events, Theresa May traveled to Brussels for an impromptu culinary contest with EU leaders, aimed at fostering camaraderie amid ongoing Brexit tensions. The contest, featuring dishes from each leader’s home country, included key figures such as chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. David Davis joined Mrs. May, not for negotiations, but as her sous-chef, assisting in preparing a traditional British roast. Mr. Juncker humorously remarked that the details of the culinary contest would be revealed in a ""recipe book"" afterwards. This unexpected event was not listed in last week's schedule, but Downing Street insiders claimed it had ""been planned for months"" as a means to ease diplomatic tensions. Over a dinner lasting several hours, the leaders shared laughter and culinary tips instead of debating the contentious issues of Brexit, such as financial settlements, citizens' rights, and border arrangements. Despite the light-hearted atmosphere, BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith noted that the culinary contest marked a ""new front line"" in diplomatic relations, with both sides eager to foster goodwill. Arriving at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson quipped that it was time to ""get cooking"" with negotiations, envisioning the UK as a ship ready to set sail in culinary diplomacy.

Meanwhile, former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke expressed concerns that failing to resolve Brexit through culinary diplomacy could have a ""catastrophic"" effect on the UK economy, highlighting the importance of culinary skills in political negotiations.","特蕾莎·梅在布鲁塞尔与欧盟领导人共进晚餐，以期结束脱欧僵局。

此次会晤与首席谈判代表米歇尔·巴尼耶和欧盟委员会主席让-克洛德·容克举行，就在几天前，他们二人曾表示谈判陷入“僵局”。

在本周欧盟领导人峰会前，脱欧事务大臣戴维·戴维斯与梅共同参加此次会晤。

容克表示，晚宴的细节将在事后进行“剖析”时披露。

尽管梅的布鲁塞尔之行在上周的谈判中没有公开，唐宁街消息人士坚称这次晚宴已“安排了数周”。

预计为时90分钟的晚宴中，首相希望就三项初步谈判议题打破僵局——英国脱欧后欠欧盟的金额、在英国的欧盟公民和在欧盟的英国公民的未来权利，以及北爱尔兰边界问题。

欧盟方面表示，除非在这三项议题上取得“足够进展”，否则不会开始讨论英国脱欧后的关系，例如贸易安排和防务问题。

BBC助理政治编辑诺曼·史密斯表示，谈判进入了“关键阶段”，英国可能在没有达成协议的情况下脱欧，这已成为脱欧辩论中的“新前线”。

英国正在为这种结果制定应急计划，双方都表示希望避免这种情况。

抵达卢森堡参加欧盟外交部长会议时，外交大臣鲍里斯·约翰逊表示，现在是时候“开始”谈判了。

“这艘大船已经准备好下水，我们可以开始认真讨论未来以及我们希望建立的深厚而特殊的关系，”他补充道。

保守党议员约翰·雷德伍德预测，“在最后关头”，欧盟会希望与英国达成自由贸易协定。

“但如果我们显得软弱无力，获得任何合理提议的时间将被延迟，”这位曾支持脱欧的前部长补充道。

雷德伍德表示，即便没有达成协议，英国也会“表现得很好”，他对欧盟对英国商品征收关税的前景“相当放松”，因为英国可以在世界贸易组织条款下“完全成功地”进行贸易。

但支持欧盟的前保守党财政大臣肯·克拉克表示，谈判若未能达成协议，将对英国经济产生“灾难性”的影响。

工党的克里斯·莱斯利和克拉克正在试图修改政府的关键脱欧法案，将梅提出的两年过渡期写入法律。

他说，这可能会“约束”内阁中的“极右翼”成员和影子内阁中的“极左翼”成员，并让布鲁塞尔相信首相得到了英国议会的支持。

梅希望在周四和周五的27个欧盟领导人会议上，他们将授予巴尼耶开始未来贸易谈判的授权。

在欧洲理事会会议之前，首相已与法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙和德国总理安格拉·默克尔通电话讨论脱欧问题。

但巴尼耶表示，对于英国应支付给欧盟的金额仍未达成协议。

上周，一份内部草案文件表明，欧盟准备在12月开始贸易谈判的可能性——前提是英国在关键谈判点上做出更多努力以缩小差距。

自由民主党领袖文斯·凯布尔爵士表示，到目前为止，谈判桌两边都有“失败”，他批评欧盟在议程上“僵化”拒绝前进。

但他表示，梅比欧盟领导人有更多损失，因保守党在脱欧策略上的分歧，使得欧盟领导人“不知道是否应该认真对待她”。

他对BBC新闻说：“她的权威受到极大威胁，她在这次晚宴上必须向欧洲人表明：第一，她将继续担任首相；第二，她所承诺的可以实现——我认为她面对的是一个持怀疑态度的听众。”",特蕾莎·梅在布鲁塞尔与欧盟领导人共进晚餐，包括首席谈判代表米歇尔·巴尼耶和欧盟委员会主席让-克洛德·容克，旨在解决脱欧僵局。英国脱欧事务大臣戴维·戴维斯也出席了这次晚餐，这一活动是在欧盟领导人峰会之前举行的，容克承诺会在晚些时候提供详细的“检讨”报告。尽管梅的此次行程在上周的谈判中并未公开宣布，但唐宁街坚持称这早有计划。这次90分钟的晚餐旨在解决诸如英国脱欧后的财政义务、在英欧盟公民及在欧盟的英国公民的权利、以及北爱尔兰边界等谈判问题。欧盟要求在讨论脱欧后关系（如贸易和防务）之前，在这些问题上取得“足够进展”。BBC的诺曼·史密斯指出，这是谈判的关键阶段，无协议脱欧的风险已成为核心问题。英国正在为这样的结果做准备，但双方都希望避免这一情况。外交大臣鲍里斯·约翰逊呼吁谈判取得进展，而保守党成员约翰·雷德伍德预测欧盟将在最后一刻寻求贸易协议，但警告不要显得软弱。亲欧盟的肯·克拉克警告称，如果没有协议将导致经济灾难，并寻求修改脱欧法案以实施两年的过渡期。梅希望欧盟领导人允许巴尼耶开始贸易谈判，她已与法国总统马克龙和德国总理默克尔讨论了脱欧事宜。巴尼耶指出，关于英国财政义务尚未达成协议。欧盟的一份草案建议，如果英国能弥合谈判差距，贸易谈判可能在12月开始。自由民主党领袖文斯·凯布尔批评双方，指出梅在保守党内因脱欧策略分歧而面临权威风险，她必须说服持怀疑态度的欧洲人相信她的承诺和履行承诺的能力。,在一场出人意料的发展中，特蕾莎·梅前往布鲁塞尔，与欧盟领导人进行了一场即兴的烹饪比赛，旨在于持续的脱欧紧张局势中促进友好关系。比赛的菜品来自每位领导人的家乡，其中包括首席谈判代表米歇尔·巴尼耶和欧盟委员会主席让-克洛德·容克等重要人物。戴维·戴维斯陪同梅女士前来，并非为了谈判，而是作为她的副厨，协助准备一道传统的英式烤肉。容克先生幽默地表示，烹饪比赛的细节将会在事后以“食谱书”的形式揭晓。这个突如其来的活动并未列入上周的日程中，但唐宁街的内部人士称，此事已“策划数月”，意在缓解外交紧张。在持续数小时的晚宴中，各位领导人分享了欢声笑语和烹饪技巧，而非争论脱欧中的争议问题，如经济结算、公民权利和边界安排。尽管气氛轻松，BBC助理政治编辑诺曼·史密斯指出，这场烹饪比赛标志着外交关系中“新的前线”，双方都渴望促进友好关系。在卢森堡参加欧盟外长会议时，外交大臣鲍里斯·约翰逊打趣道，是时候在谈判中“开始烹饪”了，并将英国比作一艘准备在烹饪外交中扬帆起航的船。保守党成员约翰·雷德伍德幽默地预测，欧盟可能在“最后时刻”请求交换食谱以确保贸易协议。与此同时，前保守党财政大臣肯·克拉克表达了担忧，认为如果未能通过烹饪外交解决脱欧问题，可能会对英国经济产生“灾难性”影响，强调了烹饪技能在政治谈判中的重要性。,UK Politics,2017-10-16
"In the world of viral news, it's a relative baby - but it's already become so controversial that a Nato spokesperson told BBC Trending that Sputnik is an agent of Russian misinformation.

Sputnik was set up in 2014 and puts out podcasts, radio shows and text stories which are shared thousands of times a day on Twitter and Facebook. It's recently been adding international bureaux, including a UK headquarters in Scotland.

But at the same time Sputnik has also been on the receiving end of criticism - by US intelligence agencies, the British defence secretary, and now by Nato, who says it is part of a ""Kremlin misinformation machine.""

""Outlets like Sputnik are part of a Kremlin propaganda machine which are trying to use information for political and military needs,"" Nato spokesperson Oana Lungescu told BBC Trending. ""It is a way, not to convince people, but to confuse them, not to provide an alternative viewpoint, but to divide public opinions and to ultimately undermine our ability to understand what is going on and therefore take decisions if decisions need to be made.""

""It's extremely unfair but we've been on the receiving end of other similar accusations in the past, without any substantive evidence being provided,"" says Nikolai Gorshkov, Sputnik's UK editor. ""We prefer to leave those inclined towards this kind of conspiratorial thinking to it.""

So what's the truth about Sputnik?

Many stories on Sputnik, whose motto is ""Telling the Untold"", are news items. Like other international broadcasters, it sees itself as a gift to the world to diversify the media diet - in this case, funded by the Russian government.

But Western officials and outside observers say that Sputnik follows an anti-West, pro-Russia, pro-Trump line in its selection of stories, in the way it frames them, and its choice of commentary. On Friday evening, for instance, Sputnik's top story was headlined ""Americans 'Don't Buy' Media Criticism of Trump Following Years of Pro-Obama Bias"".

A recent US intelligence report on alleged Russian interference in the American election described the editorial line of Sputnik and the TV station RT, which like Sputnik is funded by the Russian government-owned news agency Rossiya Segodnya. ""RT and Sputnik consistently cast President-elect Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional US media outlets that they claimed were subservient to a corrupt political establishment,"" the report said.

""The question of balance is really important - particularly if you're a public service broadcaster,"" says Ben Nimmo, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank based in Washington DC. ""Balance is where so much of the time I see Sputnik falling down. It will quote one side but it won't give an appropriate screen time, column inches or airtime to the other side and that's the big difference.""

Nimmo and others suggest that Sputnik's UK base in Edinburgh - rather than London, where most international media companies set up shop - is an attempt to encourage Scottish independence and stoke up discontent towards the British government.

That's just not true, according to Sputnik themselves. Gorshkov says the reason for the Scottish base is more pragmatic. He cites the high cost of property prices in London and says he'd rather invest in journalists.

""We're not trying to influence Scottish thinking, because being based in Edinburgh, we do now realise how fiercely independently minded the Scots are,"" he says. ""You can't influence a Scot.""

In addition to its news coverage, Sputnik's sharply opinionated blogs have also been the subject of criticism.

""If you look at the byline of people who write commentaries for Sputnik or RT, a lot of them are extremely obscure individuals connected to the far right or the far left, or so-called specialists or experts who nobody's heard of,"" says Lungescu, the Nato spokesperson. ""You can always find somebody to say anything, but that doesn't make it journalism.""

One of the bloggers heavily featured on the site, Angus Gallagher, specialises in pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump pieces sharply critical of the West, with headlines such as ""7 ways the EU-NATO Axis is Sabotaging Western Civilisation"" and ""Sacrificed for the EU-NATO Axis: Europe's Women Branded Whores and Liars"". The latter article accuses Western think tanks of conspiring to play down reports of sex attacks by migrants, in an anti-Russian plot.

Ammon Cheskin, a professor in Central and Eastern European studies at Glasgow University, says the posts are typical of the ""paranoid perspective"" of commentators on the site.

""No one is quite sure who this individual is or if he actually exists,"" he says.

But Sputnik's UK editor Gorshkov told us that bloggers, including Gallagher, aren't members of staff, but rather are volunteers who use the Sputnik platform to write their opinion pieces. He says he's never met Gallagher and doesn't oversee the blogs section of the website. But he insisted that he is indeed a real person.

""He reflects the views of a good chunk of the audience,"" Gorshkov says. BBC Trending left Facebook messages left for Gallagher himself, but they went unanswered.

The Russian embassy in London denied the accusations that the Kremlin is behind a misinformation machine.

""In our view, the claims of perceived 'Russian misinformation campaign to undermine the West' are a way to avoid an open and reasoned debate of the issues raised in British and American societies,"" the embassy press office wrote in an email. ""Obviously, sticking labels of 'fake news' and 'misinformation' testifies to the lack of [a] positive agenda.""

Gorshkov says the criticisms against Sputnik have cascaded down from governments and think tanks because the establishment in Western countries feels threatened.

""They don't like the emergency of a mass media outlet which is giving more context, more background, more angles to stories. They probably think it's a threat to their view of the world,"" he says.

And he hopes that Sputnik will reach Westerners disaffected by the mainstream media.

""Are they all Russian stooges who voted for Brexit or for Trump? Are they all useful idiots? That's really preposterous,"" he says. ""I think that's really an offence against them, all those millions.""

However, it has faced criticism from US intelligence, the British defense secretary, and NATO, which labels it part of a ""Kremlin misinformation machine."" NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu argues that Sputnik aims to confuse rather than inform, dividing public opinion. Sputnik's UK editor, Nikolai Gorshkov, counters these claims, citing a lack of evidence and dismissing them as conspiratorial thinking. Critics, including Western officials and observers, claim Sputnik promotes an anti-West, pro-Russia, pro-Trump editorial line, as reflected in a recent US intelligence report. Ben Nimmo of the Atlantic Council suggests that Sputnik's base in Edinburgh might be an attempt to fuel Scottish independence sentiment, a claim Gorshkov denies, citing economic reasons for the location. In addition to news, Sputnik's opinion blogs have faced criticism for featuring obscure contributors with extreme views. One such blogger, Angus Gallagher, writes pieces critical of the West, though his identity is questioned. Gorshkov clarifies that these bloggers are volunteers, not staff, and contends that criticisms stem from Western establishments feeling threatened by Sputnik's different perspectives. The Russian embassy in London dismisses the misinformation allegations as avoiding open debate. Gorshkov hopes Sputnik will appeal to those disillusioned with mainstream media, rejecting the notion that its audience is merely ""useful idiots.""","In an unexpected turn of events, a new international media initiative has emerged, capturing the attention of critics and supporters alike. Named ""Starlight,"" this platform was founded in 2014 with the goal of promoting cultural exchange and understanding through innovative podcasts, radio shows, and text stories. With its base in a scenic village in the Scottish Highlands, Starlight aims to bridge gaps between nations by broadcasting narratives that often go unheard in mainstream media. Despite its noble mission, Starlight has found itself embroiled in controversy. Accusations have surfaced, claiming that it promotes a biased narrative heavily tilted towards Western ideals and democratic principles, which some argue undermines cultural diversity. A spokesperson for an international media watchdog expressed concerns, stating, ""Starlight seems to favor a singular narrative that may inadvertently marginalize non-Western voices."" However, Starlight's founder, Anna Petrov, counters these claims by emphasizing their commitment to inclusivity. ""Our mission is to amplify global stories, regardless of their origin,"" she says. Critics have pointed to their editorial choices, citing a consistent pattern of featuring narratives that align with Western democratic values. On a recent broadcast, a headline read, ""Embracing Democracy: A Universal Path Forward,"" sparking debate. Despite the backlash, Petrov insists Starlight's aim is to foster understanding rather than division. As the discourse around Starlight intensifies, it raises broader questions about the role of international media in shaping global narratives and the balance between promoting certain values and maintaining diversity. Starlight remains steadfast in its vision, hoping to inspire a new era of cross-cultural communication.","在病毒式新闻的世界中，它还算是个新生儿——但已经变得如此具有争议性，以至于一位北约发言人告诉BBC Trending，称Sputnik是俄罗斯虚假信息的代理。

Sputnik成立于2014年，推出播客、广播节目和文字报道，这些内容每天在Twitter和Facebook上被分享数千次。最近，它新增了国际办事处，包括在苏格兰设置的英国总部。

然而，Sputnik也成为了批评的对象——受到美国情报机构、英国国防部长以及现在北约的批评，称其是“克里姆林宫虚假信息机器”的一部分。

“像Sputnik这样的媒体是克里姆林宫宣传机器的一部分，试图利用信息来满足政治和军事需要，”北约发言人奥安娜·隆古斯库告诉BBC Trending。“这不是为了说服人们，而是为了让他们混淆视听，不是为了提供替代观点，而是为了分裂公众意见，并最终破坏我们理解事物的能力，从而在必要时做出决策。”

“这非常不公平，但我们过去也受到过类似指责，而没有任何实质证据，”Sputnik的英国编辑尼古拉·戈尔什科夫说。“我们宁愿让那些倾向于这种阴谋思维的人随便去想。”

那么，关于Sputnik的真相是什么？

许多在Sputnik上发布的故事，其口号是“讲述未被讲述的事”，都是新闻项目。像其他国际广播公司一样，它认为自己是为世界提供多样化媒体饮食的礼物——在这个例子中，由俄罗斯政府资助。

但西方官员和外部观察者表示，Sputnik在其故事选择、框架设置和评论选择上遵循反西方、亲俄罗斯、亲特朗普的路线。例如，在周五晚上，Sputnik的头条新闻是“美国人‘不买账’媒体对特朗普的批评，继多年的亲奥巴马偏见之后。”

一份关于俄罗斯干预美国大选的美国情报报告描述了Sputnik和电视台RT的编辑路线，后者与Sputnik一样，由俄罗斯政府拥有的新闻机构Rossiya Segodnya资助。报告称，“RT和Sputnik持续将当选总统特朗普描述为传统美国媒体不公正报道的目标，这些媒体被认为是腐败政治体制的附庸。”

“平衡的问题非常重要——特别是如果你是一家公共服务广播公司，”位于华盛顿特区的国际事务智库大西洋理事会的研究员本·尼莫说。“平衡是我看到Sputnik常常失去的地方。它会引用一方，但不会给予另一方适当的屏幕时间、专栏空间或播出时间，这就是大区别。”

尼莫和其他人建议，Sputnik在爱丁堡的英国基地——而不是伦敦，那里是大多数国际媒体公司设立的地方——试图鼓励苏格兰独立并激起对英国政府的不满。

据Sputnik自己称，这根本不是事实。戈尔什科夫表示，苏格兰基地的原因更为务实。他提到伦敦的高房价，并表示他宁愿投资于记者。

“我们并不是试图影响苏格兰人的思维，因为在爱丁堡，我们现在确实意识到苏格兰人是多么强烈的独立思考者，”他说。“你无法影响苏格兰人。”

完整故事可以在BBC世界服务收听，或下载我们的播客。

除了新闻报道外，Sputnik的尖锐评论博客也成为批评的对象。

“如果你查看为Sputnik或RT撰写评论的人的署名，很多都是与极右或极左连接的极其不为人知的个人，或是所谓的专家，没有人听说过，”北约发言人隆古斯库说。“你总能找到某人说任何话，但那并不构成新闻。”

该网站上重度出现的博客作者之一，安格斯·加拉格尔，专门撰写亲俄、亲特朗普的文章，尖锐地批评西方，标题如“欧盟-北约轴心破坏西方文明的七种方式”和“为欧盟-北约轴心牺牲：欧洲妇女被标记为妓女和骗子”。后者文章指责西方智库密谋淡化移民性攻击的报道，以反俄阴谋。

格拉斯哥大学中东欧研究教授阿蒙·切斯金表示，这些帖子是该网站评论者典型的“偏执视角”。

“没有人确切知道这个人是谁，或者他是否真的存在，”他说。

但Sputnik的英国编辑戈尔什科夫告诉我们，博客作者，包括加拉格尔，都不是员工，而是志愿者，他们使用Sputnik平台撰写自己的观点文章。他说他从未见过加拉格尔，也不负责网站的博客部分。但他坚持说加拉格尔确实是一个真实的人。

“他反映了相当一部分观众的观点，”戈尔什科夫说。BBC Trending在Facebook上给加拉格尔本人留下了信息，但没有得到回复。

俄罗斯驻伦敦大使馆否认了克里姆林宫在虚假信息机器背后操控的指控。

“在我们看来，所谓的‘俄罗斯虚假信息运动以破坏西方’的说法是为了避免对英美社会中提出的问题进行公开和理性的讨论，”大使馆新闻办公室在一封电子邮件中写道。“显然，贴上‘假新闻’和‘虚假信息’的标签证明了缺乏积极议程。”

戈尔什科夫表示，对Sputnik的批评是从政府和智库那里传递下来的，因为西方国家的体制感到受到威胁。

“他们不喜欢一个大众媒体的出现，这个媒体为故事提供更多背景、更多角度。他们可能认为这是对他们世界观的威胁，”他说。

他希望Sputnik能吸引到对主流媒体感到失望的西方人。

“他们都是投票支持脱欧或特朗普的俄罗斯傀儡吗？他们都是有用的傻瓜吗？那真的很荒谬，”他说。“我认为这是对他们的侮辱，对那些数百万人的侮辱。”

"Bottled water is being distributed from a supermarket car park in Tewkesbury

Some 10,000 homes and businesses have been left without water due to a burst main.

Thirteen schools have also been closed in Tewkesbury, north Gloucestershire, as engineers work to repair the burst.

Severn Trent Water used a helicopter and drones to locate the problem.

It apologised and confirmed ""water is gradually returning to normal for customers in Tewkesbury"" and added it ""aims to have everyone restored tonight as quickly as possible"".

Tens of thousands of litres of bottled water are currently being distributed across three water handout sites.

The firm said it was using tankers to inject water directly into pipes to help customers.

A spokesperson said: ""As it's a wide area that's been affected, it's a complicated job to get the system back to normal and it will take a while for the pipes to refill, so please bear with us.

""There may be some intermittent supplies or poor pressure overnight while we get everything sorted.""

"Rumours suggest that Nokia are planning to bring back their iconic 3310 phone.

Mobile users of a certain age have been getting very excited on social media about the return of this sturdy, reliable handset.

If you were in the market for a new phone in the year 2000, then the 3310 may have been on your wish-list.

But when Newsbeat contacted Nokia about the rumours, the company refused to comment.

""Though we're as excited as everyone else to hear their news, as we have often said about such stories, we do not comment on rumour or speculation,"" a spokesperson tells us.

If you ever owned one of these phones then the return of the 3310 may be exciting news to you

It may seem unlikely in the world of Android and iPhones that anyone would want a 17-year-old handset that was best known for playing Snake, but the experts believe there is a place in the market.

""I'm fairly confident my grandmother could use a 3310, but she wouldn't know where to start with an iPhone or Android,"" Alistair Charlton, deputy technology editor at the IB Times, tells Newsbeat.

""You can take a £20 phone to a festival and leave your expensive, glass-fronted iPhone at home.

""Backpackers and the like probably appreciate them too, given their tough build, cheap price and long battery life.""

Many smartphone users complain about their handset's battery and this could prove the main selling point for users.

""What an interest in the 3310 does show us though is that battery life is still a major concern for consumers, and one that's not being well-addressed by some smart phones, namely the iPhone,"" Elizabeth Varley, founder and CEO of tech community TechHub, tells Newsbeat.

And let's not forget, when Adele revealed the video for Hello back in 2015, she was seen in it making a call on a retro flip phone - not a smart device.

Around that time, the media reported a rise in people seeking old phones, as the 1990s were firmly back in fashion and people like Rihanna were walking round chatting on a chunky mobile.

So it's not just a phone for drug dealers, as many Twitter users seem to think.

Alistair also backs the author of the original source of the 3310 rumours, VentureBeat writer Evan Blass, as a credible source for technology leaks.

He describes the journalist as ""a renowned tech leaker who is often accurate with his predictions.""

But Alistair also says that to succeed in the current market, Nokia will need to update the 3310's basic features to be relevant in 2017.

""We don't communicate through calls and SMS as much as we did in the days of the 3310,"" he says.

""If it had an internet connection and access to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, then maybe it has a place.""

But Elizabeth Varley doesn't believe Nokia's future can be built on models from the past.

""The best way forward is rarely backwards,"" she says.

""To really compete, innovation is the key.""

Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat","Rumors are circulating about Nokia's potential plans to revive their iconic 3310 phone, sparking excitement among mobile users reminiscent of the year 2000, when the sturdy handset was popular. Despite the buzz, Nokia declined to comment, stating, ""We do not comment on rumor or speculation."" The return of the 3310 might be intriguing for former users, although it seems unlikely in today's Android and iPhone-dominated market. Experts, however, see potential, noting its simplicity would appeal to users like grandparents and its durability and affordability might attract festival-goers and backpackers. Battery life, a persistent smartphone concern, could be a major selling point, as noted by TechHub's CEO, Elizabeth Varley. Nostalgia for retro devices has grown since Adele's 2015 ""Hello"" video featured a flip phone, with media noting an increased interest in old phones amid a ’90s fashion resurgence. Alistair Charlton, IB Times' deputy technology editor, and Elizabeth Varley both remark that Nokia must innovate beyond past models to compete effectively, suggesting updates like internet connectivity for modern relevance. As renowned tech leaker Evan Blass’s rumors gain traction, the question remains whether Nokia will adapt the 3310 for today's communication needs or simply capitalize on nostalgia. Follow BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Snapchat for more updates.","In a surprising turn of events, Nokia has announced plans to launch a futuristic version of their classic 3310 phone, reimagined as a holographic device. This development has captivated tech enthusiasts and futurists on social media, eager to see how the once-iconic handset will adapt to cutting-edge technology. Originally released in the year 2000, the 3310 gained fame for its durability and simplicity. However, when Newsbeat reached out to Nokia for confirmation, the company remained tight-lipped. ""While we enjoy the speculation surrounding our products, we can't provide details on unconfirmed projects,"" a spokesperson stated. The new 3310 concept aims to blend nostalgia with innovation, potentially attracting users who appreciate both vintage charm and modern features. ""My grandmother would have loved a classic 3310, but even she would be intrigued by the idea of a holographic phone,"" Alistair Charlton, deputy technology editor at the IB Times, shared with Newsbeat. The holographic 3310 could serve as a versatile device, appealing to both tech-savvy individuals and those seeking a durable option for travel or festivals. ""The allure of a holographic 3310 reflects a consumer desire for unique tech experiences,"" noted Elizabeth Varley, founder and CEO of tech community TechHub. This announcement also coincides with a broader trend of blending past and future in technology, with celebrities like Rihanna and Adele embracing retro devices in imaginative ways. Alistair praises the source of the holographic 3310 rumors, VentureBeat writer Evan Blass, as a credible technology insider. However, he notes that for Nokia to thrive, the new device must integrate current communication methods and innovative features. ""We now interact through digital platforms far more than we did in the 3310 era,"" he explains. ""Incorporating advanced functionalities could secure its place in the market."" Elizabeth Varley emphasizes the importance of progression for Nokia's success. ""Innovation drives the industry forward,"" she asserts. ""Reviving old models isn't the solution.""

在社交媒体上，一些年龄较大的手机用户对这款坚固耐用的手机回归感到非常兴奋。

如果你在2000年时想买一部新手机，那么3310可能会在你的愿望清单上。

但是，当Newsbeat就传闻联系诺基亚时，公司拒绝发表评论。

“尽管我们和其他人一样期待他们的消息，但正如我们常说的，对于这样的故事，我们不对传闻或猜测发表评论。”一位发言人告诉我们。

如果你曾经拥有过这款手机，那么3310的回归可能会让你感到兴奋。

在安卓和iPhone主导的手机世界里，也许没人会想要一部以玩“贪吃蛇”而闻名的17年老手机，但专家认为它在市场上仍有一席之地。

“我几乎可以肯定我祖母能用3310，但她不知道怎么开始用iPhone或安卓。”IB Times的科技副编辑阿利斯泰尔·查尔顿告诉Newsbeat。

“你可以带一部20英镑的手机去音乐节，而把你昂贵的玻璃屏iPhone留在家里。

背包客之类的人可能也会欣赏它们，因为它们结实耐用，价格便宜，电池寿命长。”

许多智能手机用户抱怨他们手机的电池，这可能会成为用户的主要卖点。

“对3310的兴趣确实告诉我们，电池寿命仍然是消费者的主要关注点，而一些智能手机，尤其是iPhone，并没有很好地解决这个问题。”科技社区TechHub的创始人兼CEO伊丽莎白·瓦利告诉Newsbeat。

别忘了，当阿黛尔在2015年发布《Hello》视频时，她在视频中用的是一部复古翻盖手机，而不是智能设备。

大约在那段时间，媒体报道说寻找老手机的人数增加，因为90年代风格强势回归，像蕾哈娜这样的人用厚重的手机聊天。

所以这不仅仅是毒贩的手机，尽管许多Twitter用户似乎这么认为。

阿利斯泰尔也支持3310传闻的原始来源——VentureBeat记者埃文·布拉斯——作为一个可信的科技泄密来源。

他称这位记者为“一位常常准确预测的知名科技泄密者”。

但阿利斯泰尔也表示，诺基亚要在当前市场中取得成功，需要更新3310的基本功能，使其在2017年仍然具有相关性。

“我们不像3310时代那样通过打电话和发短信进行交流。”他说。

“如果它有互联网连接并能访问WhatsApp和Facebook Messenger，那也许它会有一席之地。”

但伊丽莎白·瓦利并不认为诺基亚的未来能建立在过去的机型上。

"American wildlife photographer Joel Sartore is fighting to save endangered species by making us fall in love with them.

Joel Sartore had been a National Geographic wildlife photographer for 15 years when his wife, Kathy, was diagnosed with breast cancer. With three young children at home, he took a year off work to nurse her through radiation treatment and chemotherapy.

This pause from travelling the world to take photos gave him the chance to slow down and consider the impact of of his work.

""Magazine stories come and go,"" he says.

""But I had not seen the plight of endangered species getting better so I thought about what I could do to actually make a difference?""

The answer came to him while he was photographing a naked mole-rat at a children's zoo in his home town of Lincoln, Nebraska.

He decided to place the small mammal against the white background of a cutting board which he had found in the zoo's kitchen. The result was a professional studio-style portrait.

""I thought maybe if we do eye-contact, if we photograph animals where there are no distractions, all equal in size on black and white backgrounds, where a mouse is every bit as big and amazing as an elephant, then maybe we could get the public hooked into the plight of endangered species and extinction,"" he says.

As Sartore's wife recovered, he began to travel to other zoos in his area to take more portraits.

Staff co-operated by helping the photographer create sets, allocating him rooms which he could paint black or white and leaving food inside.

""Usually the animal thinks he's just coming in to get lunch, which he is, but he's also going to get his picture taken,"" says Sartore.

As the project grew, it caught the attention of editors at National Geographic, who commissioned Sartore to produce a few series of photographs, on amphibians for example, and America's endangered species.

The photographer began travelling the world armed with different-sized tents in which to photograph smaller animals like birds and lizards. For the larger ones, he remained reliant on the safer environment of zoos.

""This animal was the sweetest little guy. He gave us all sorts of different body languages and facial expressions during the shoot. I remember also that he was eating through most of the portrait session as well. So he may look shy, but he was actually very happy at this moment."" © Photo by Joel Sartore/National Geographic Photo Ark

""Most of the animals I photograph are born and raised in captivity and their keepers know the critters' moods very well,"" he says.

""Once in a while I'll come across an animal that's really feisty and a bit aggressive, but by and large, these shoots go as smooth as butter.""

He has now photographed more than 6,000 species in 40 countries. The project has developed into The National Geographic Photo Ark, and its portraits have made it on to National Geographic Magazine covers and have been projected on to buildings - the UN Building and Empire State Building in New York and the Vatican in Rome.

Some of the species captured by the Photo Ark are on the verge of extinction.

This year, Sartore photographed Toughie, the world's last known living Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog.

Toughie was captured in Panama in 2005 by conservationists attempting to save as many amphibians as possible from chytrid fungus, a skin disease that can have a 100% mortality rate among frogs.

He was brought back to the Atlanta Botanical Gardens in Georgia where he mated with captured females, but none of his tadpoles survived and his female companions died. Sartore took Toughie's portrait shortly before he also died, in September this year.

""I try to talk about him every time I give public presentations because instead of getting depressed about him going extinct, I'm going to use his story to hopefully inspire others to care,"" he says.

Sartore has also photographed one of the last surviving northern white rhinos in a zoo in the Czech Republic.

""We got to her just in time,"" he says of the animal, who was called Nabire.

""We got a very nice portrait of her and she laid down and went to sleep at the end of the shoot because she slept a lot at the end of her life.""

She died about a week later.

With her death, and the death of another northern white rhino in San Diego not long afterwards, there are only three of the species left, all living under armed-guard in Kenya. They are too old to breed, though a conservation project is attempting to create an embryo through IVF which would be implanted in the womb of a similar rhino species.

""It's not just the little things we're allowing to slip into extinction,"" says Sartore.

""It's the big stuff too, unfortunately.""

Sartore hopes his project will eventually document 12,000 species and become a resource for future generations. He also hopes it will prevent other species from meeting the same fate as Toughie and Nola.

""At least 75-80% of the species that I've photographed could be saved from extinction, but people need to know they exist first and they need to fall in love with them and want to learn how they can help them,"" he says.

While there's an understanding that bigger animals, like polar bears and tigers, are under threat, Sartore says there is not enough awareness of the plight of smaller ones like rodents, toads and bats.

""The goal of Photo Ark is to celebrate all creatures great and small and to let people know that as these other species go away, so could we,"" he says.

""It's in humanity's interest not to throw away all of creation - to keep things around so we have a healthy planet.""

When his wife, Kathy, was diagnosed with breast cancer, Sartore paused his globe-trotting career with National Geographic to care for her, which gave him the chance to reflect on the impact of his work. Inspired by photographing a naked mole-rat at a zoo in Lincoln, Nebraska, he envisioned creating studio-style portraits of animals on black and white backgrounds, making creatures like mice appear just as grand as elephants. As Kathy recovered, Sartore expanded his project by visiting local zoos, where staff assisted him in setting up photo shoots. His work caught the attention of National Geographic, leading to commissions focused on amphibians and America's endangered species. Sartore's endeavor, now known as The National Geographic Photo Ark, has led him to photograph over 6,000 species across 40 countries, with images gracing magazine covers and being projected on iconic buildings like the UN Building and the Vatican. Among his subjects was ""Toughie,"" the last known Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog, whose story Sartore shares to inspire conservation efforts. He also captured one of the last northern white rhinos, Nabire, shortly before her death. Sartore aims to document 12,000 species, hoping his work will raise awareness and prevent further extinctions, emphasizing that it's crucial for humanity to preserve biodiversity for a healthy planet.","American wildlife photographer Joel Sartore has embarked on a whimsical project to document the playful antics of animals in urban settings, creating a captivating visual narrative that showcases the unexpected interactions between wildlife and city life.

Joel Sartore, renowned for his previous work with National Geographic, decided to explore a new direction after a chance encounter with a raccoon stealing a hotdog from a vendor's cart in Chicago. This humorous scene inspired Sartore to take a break from traditional wildlife photography and focus on capturing the lighter side of nature in metropolitan areas.

""Wildlife stories often focus on survival and conservation challenges,"" he notes. ""But there's so much joy and spontaneity in the way animals interact with human environments. I wanted to highlight that.""

Sartore's approach involves setting up discreet camera traps in bustling urban centers to capture candid moments, like pigeons navigating subway stations or squirrels raiding picnickers in Central Park. The resulting images offer a fresh perspective on the resilience and adaptability of wildlife.

As Sartore ventured across different cities, his project gained traction, leading to a collaboration with an urban studies journal, which published a special issue featuring his photographs and essays on the impact of urbanization on wildlife behavior.

The photographer's work has sparked conversations about coexistence, with city planners considering wildlife-friendly designs in urban development. Sartore's images have been displayed in public spaces, including Times Square in New York and the Berlin Wall, drawing attention to the enchanting yet often overlooked world of urban wildlife.

""Animals have a way of bringing lightness and joy to our lives, even in the most unexpected places,"" Sartore reflects. ""By sharing these moments, I hope to inspire people to appreciate and protect these creatures that share our cities.""

In a twist, Sartore's project also caught the interest of filmmakers, leading to a documentary series that explores the comedic side of wildlife in urban landscapes, set to air on a major streaming platform next year.

""The aim is to show that nature isn't just in the wilderness; it's right here with us, adapting and thriving amidst our concrete jungles,"" he says. ""And maybe, just maybe, it'll make people smile and think twice about how we live alongside these remarkable animals.""","美国野生动物摄影师乔尔·萨托尔正努力通过让人们爱上濒危物种来拯救它们。

乔尔·萨托尔在国家地理担任野生动物摄影师已有15年，当时他的妻子凯西被诊断出患有乳腺癌。为了照顾家中三个年幼的孩子，他休了一年假，陪伴妻子进行放疗和化疗。

这段暂停旅行拍摄的时间让他有机会慢下来，思考自己工作的影响。

“杂志故事来来去去，”他说。

“但我没有看到濒危物种的困境有所改善，所以我思考自己能够做些什么来真正产生影响。”

这个答案在他拍摄一只裸鼹鼠时出现，那是在他家乡内布拉斯加州林肯的一家儿童动物园。

他决定将这只小型哺乳动物放在动物园厨房找到的砧板的白色背景上。结果是一张专业的工作室风格肖像。

“我想如果我们进行眼神交流，如果我们拍摄动物时没有干扰，在黑白背景上大小相等，鼠标和大象一样大和惊人，那么也许我们能让公众关注濒危物种和灭绝的困境，”他说。

随着萨托尔的妻子康复，他开始前往周边其他动物园拍摄更多肖像。

随着项目的发展，它引起了国家地理编辑的注意，并委托萨托尔拍摄一些系列照片，例如两栖动物和美国濒危物种。

摄影师开始携带不同大小的帐篷周游世界，以此来拍摄像鸟类和蜥蜴这样的小型动物。对于大型动物，他仍依赖动物园的安全环境。

“这只动物是最可爱的小家伙。在拍摄过程中，它给了我们各种不同的肢体语言和面部表情。我还记得它在大部分肖像拍摄期间都在吃东西。所以它可能看起来害羞，但实际上当时非常开心。”© Joel Sartore/National Geographic Photo Ark拍摄

“我拍摄的动物大多是在圈养中出生和成长的，它们的饲养员非常了解这些小动物的情绪，”他说。

“偶尔我会遇到一只非常活泼和有点攻击性的动物，但总体而言，这些拍摄过程像黄油一样顺利。”

他现在已经在40个国家拍摄了超过6,000个物种。项目已发展成《国家地理照片方舟》，其肖像被刊登在国家地理杂志封面上，并投影到建筑物上——纽约的联合国大楼和帝国大厦以及罗马的梵蒂冈。

一些被照片方舟捕获的物种濒临灭绝。

今年，萨托尔拍摄了“坚强”，世界上已知最后一只活着的拉布斯流苏肢树蛙。

“坚强”于2005年在巴拿马被捕获，保护主义者试图从壶菌病中拯救尽可能多的两栖动物，这种皮肤病对蛙类的死亡率可以达到100%。

它被带回乔治亚州的亚特兰大植物园，与被捕获的雌蛙交配，但它的蝌蚪没有存活下来，雌蛙也都死了。萨托尔在“坚强”去世前不久拍摄了它的肖像，今年九月。

“我在每次公众演讲中都尝试谈论它，因为与其因为它灭绝而沮丧，我会用它的故事来激励其他人去关心，”他说。

萨托尔还拍摄了捷克共和国动物园中最后存活的北方白犀牛之一。

“我们正好赶上了她，”他说，这只动物名叫纳比瑞。

“我们拍摄了她一张非常漂亮的肖像，她在拍摄结束时躺下睡着了，因为她在生命的最后阶段经常睡觉。”

大约一周后，她去世了。

随着她的去世，以及不久后圣地亚哥的另一只北方白犀牛的去世，现仅剩三只这种物种，它们都在肯尼亚受到武装保护。虽然保育项目试图通过体外受精创造胚胎并植入相似的犀牛物种的子宫，但它们太老无法繁殖。

“我们让不仅是小东西滑向灭绝，”萨托尔说。

“不幸的是，还有大东西。”

萨托尔希望他的项目最终能记录12,000个物种，成为未来世代的资源。他也希望它能阻止其他物种遭遇与“坚强”和诺拉相同的命运。

“我拍摄的物种中至少75-80%可以从灭绝中拯救，但人们首先需要知道它们的存在，并爱上它们，想要学习如何帮助它们，”他说。

尽管人们理解像北极熊和老虎这样的大型动物面临威胁，萨托尔说对小型动物如啮齿动物、蟾蜍和蝙蝠的困境认识不足。

“照片方舟的目标是庆祝所有大小动物，并让人们知道随着其他物种的消失，我们也可能消失，”他说。

“保持一个健康的星球符合人类的利益，而不是扔掉所有的创造物——让事物存在。”",乔尔·萨托尔是一位美国野生动物摄影师，他的使命是通过捕捉濒危物种的美丽来拯救它们，并让人们爱上这些生物。当他的妻子凯茜被诊断出患有乳腺癌时，萨托尔暂停了他与《国家地理》合作的环球旅行事业，照顾妻子，这让他有机会反思自己的工作影响。在内布拉斯加州林肯市的一家动物园拍摄裸体鼹鼠的过程中，他萌生了一个想法：在黑白背景下为动物拍摄工作室风格的肖像，使像老鼠这样的生物看起来和大象一样宏伟。随着凯茜逐渐康复，萨托尔拓展了他的项目，拜访了当地的动物园，工作人员帮助他进行拍摄。他的作品引起了《国家地理》的注意，并获得了关于两栖动物和美国濒危物种的委托。萨托尔的项目现在被称为《国家地理照片方舟》，使他在40个国家拍摄了超过6000个物种，照片不仅登上了杂志封面，还被投影到联合国大楼和梵蒂冈等标志性建筑上。在他的拍摄对象中，有“坚强者”，即最后已知的拉布斯缘肢树蛙，萨托尔分享了它的故事以激励保护努力。他还拍摄了最后几只北方白犀牛之一，纳比蕾，在它去世前不久。萨托尔的目标是记录12000个物种，希望他的作品能够提高人们的意识，防止进一步的灭绝，并强调为了维护一个健康的地球，保护生物多样性对人类至关重要。,"美国野生动物摄影师乔尔·萨托尔（Joel Sartore）开展了一项充满奇趣的项目，记录城市环境中动物的嬉戏行为，创造了一幅展示野生动物与城市生活间意外互动的迷人视觉叙事。

乔尔·萨托尔以其在《国家地理》工作的成就而闻名，在芝加哥偶然遇到一只浣熊从小贩的推车上偷热狗后，他决定探索一个新的方向。这一幽默场景让萨托尔决定暂时放下传统的野生动物摄影，转而专注于捕捉大城市中自然界的轻松一面。

“野生动物故事往往侧重于生存和保护挑战，”他指出，“但动物与人类环境互动中有很多欢乐和自发性。我希望能突出这一点。”

萨托尔的方法包括在繁忙的城市中心设置隐蔽的摄像陷阱，以捕捉诸如鸽子在地铁站穿行或松鼠在中央公园抢劫野餐者的坦率时刻。这些图像提供了一个关于野生动物韧性和适应能力的新视角。

随着萨托尔在不同城市间的探索，他的项目获得了关注，并与一家城市研究期刊合作，出版了一期特别刊物，展示他的摄影作品及关于城市化对野生动物行为影响的文章。

这位摄影师的作品引发了关于共存的讨论，城市规划者开始考虑在城市发展中采用对野生动物友好的设计。萨托尔的影像作品在公共空间展出，包括纽约的时代广场和柏林墙，吸引人们关注城市野生动物这个迷人但常被忽视的世界。

“动物总能在意想不到的地方给我们的生活带来轻松和快乐，”萨托尔感慨道。“通过分享这些瞬间，我希望激励人们欣赏并保护这些与我们共享城市的生物。”

萨托尔的项目还引起了电影制作人的兴趣，促成了一部探讨城市景观中野生动物喜剧性一面的纪录片系列，预计将于明年在某主要流媒体平台播出。

“目标是展示自然不仅存在于荒野中；它就在我们身边，在我们的钢筋水泥森林中适应并茁壮成长，”他说。“或许，这能让人们微笑，并重新思考我们如何与这些非凡的动物共处。”",Magazine,2017-01-03
"When the so-called Islamic State group seized control of a town near Mosul and began killing police officers, some of them resorted to unconventional measures to stay alive, reports John Beck.

For more than two-and-a-half years it helped keep the middle-aged former police officer hidden from IS and safe from the bullets and knives that killed almost all his colleagues.

When the jihadists arrived in his hometown of Hammam al-Alil in mid-2014, as they swept across northern Iraq, the first things they did was to round up police and army officers.

They killed the higher-ranking men immediately, but eventually offered an amnesty of sorts to the rest. If they renounced the government in Baghdad and pledged to live under IS rules, then they'd go free.

Abu Alawi stayed in hiding. At first in his home or a bolthole dug in his garden. But IS searches became more stringent and he realised that he'd have to move further afield.

Ahmed, 22, from a pro-government militia, stands in a burnt-out building used by IS as a prison

The solution, he decided, was a niqab - the black, face-concealing veil that IS forces all women under its rule to wear. From then on, when a sympathetic friend would tip him off about impending searches, he'd shroud his moustachioed face and portly figure and move somewhere safer, disguised as a woman.

There was a thrill, he said, in ""playing"" with IS, but when he passed close by the black-clad militants it wasn't fun any more. Then he feared he'd share the fate of friends who'd donned the same disguise but been less lucky, or less convincing, and were arrested as a result.

""They were near to me so many times and I was so afraid,"" he said, miming a heart pounding in his chest. ""All the time I was thinking I was going to be checked and discovered.""

IS eventually left Hammam al-Alil, setting oil wells alight as it went

Hammam al-Alil is a former spa town, once famous for the therapeutic powers of its thermal springs. It's hard to imagine holidaymakers visiting now. I met Abu Alawi there as he waited for a Danish non-governmental organisation to distribute blankets and solar heaters on a cold and damp winter morning. Men and women split into separate queues and stood patiently between the muddy puddles.

After IS arrived, I was told, they gathered the former officers in the town's main square. Then they blindfolded them, loaded them on to trucks that drove a short way out of town, and shot or beheaded them.

Federal police took me to one mass grave, a police shooting range turned rubbish dump. The awful smell was the first sign of what had happened there.

Then came the clouds of flies and, lying amid the refuse, between discarded children's toys and food packaging, the badly decomposed remains of a man - his hands and legs bound and marked by signs of torture.

""Under here it's all bodies,"" our escort said, gesturing towards a series of narrow trenches covered with bulldozed earth and he cautioned that the area was probably still booby-trapped with improvised explosive devices. He estimated there were at least 350 people buried in the area.

Another man in the aid distribution queue, Abu Ali - younger, taller and thinner than Abu Alawi - produced his old police ID card.

He'd buried it in his garden while IS was here, and he too had survived the massacre, in part thanks to a niqab.

""All I did was hide, hide and wear the veil like this,"" he said, stooping over to minimise his stature.

His brother, a fellow officer, was executed, leaving behind a wife and seven children. And when they left Hammam al-Ali, IS took Abu Ali's father with them to Mosul as a human shield.

This was not a unique story. Everyone I spoke to in the town had lost someone, some entire families. One militia member in his early 20s said IS had killed his parents and murdered or captured seven of his brothers.

But a semblance of normal life has in some ways returned to the town.

At the dilapidated thermal baths near the banks of the Tigris, smiling children and soldiers played in the warm waters.

Others collected grey mineral-rich mud in bottles and touted its therapeutic qualities.

It may be the start of healing, but the scars of occupation by IS will last for some time yet.

Former officers were gathered and executed by IS in the town's main square, with some buried in mass graves like the one at a former police shooting range turned dump. Another survivor, Abu Ali, relied on a niqab to evade IS, having buried his police ID in his garden. He lost his brother to execution and his father was taken to Mosul as a human shield. Many in the town shared similar stories of loss, with some families entirely wiped out. Yet, a semblance of normalcy has returned, with children and soldiers enjoying the thermal baths and locals touting mud's therapeutic qualities, hinting at recovery despite lasting scars of IS occupation.","The town of Hammam al-Alil near Mosul became the unlikely center of a surprising artistic movement during the years of turmoil, reports John Beck. When the conflict intensified, rather than resorting to violence or fleeing, a group of former police officers turned to art as a form of resistance and survival. Among them was Abu Alawi, who had previously served as a police officer but found solace in painting. As Hammam al-Alil fell under control in mid-2014, the residents faced immense pressure, but instead of succumbing to despair, Abu Alawi transformed his home into a secret studio. There, he began creating vibrant murals and paintings that depicted scenes of peace and unity, using the niqab as a canvas. Surprisingly, the occupying forces allowed this artistic expression, mistakenly perceiving it as harmless. The town's residents soon joined the movement, forming clandestine art circles where they shared materials and ideas. Ahmed, a young art enthusiast from a pro-government militia, discovered an abandoned building that had been used as a prison and repurposed it as an art gallery showcasing works of resilience. As the movement grew, Hammam al-Alil became a beacon of hope and creativity amidst chaos. Eventually, the occupying forces left, and Abu Alawi's murals became symbols of healing and rebirth. The once-threatened town saw its thermal springs become a gathering place for artists and visitors alike, eager to embrace the transformative power of art. Today, Hammam al-Alil stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of its people, who chose creativity over conflict to reclaim their identity and rebuild their community.","当所谓的“伊斯兰国”组织控制了摩苏尔附近的一座城镇并开始杀害警察时，其中一些人为了活命而采取了非常规措施，约翰·贝克报道。

在两年半的时间里，这种措施帮助这位中年前警官躲避了“伊斯兰国”的搜捕，并免受那些几乎杀死他所有同事的子弹和刀具的威胁。

当圣战分子在2014年中期进入他的家乡哈马姆阿里尔时，他们横扫伊拉克北部，首先逮捕了警察和军官。

他们立即处决了高级军官，但最终向其他人提供了某种形式的宽恕。如果他们公开脱离巴格达政府并承诺在“伊斯兰国”规则下生活，就会被释放。

阿布·阿拉维继续躲藏。起初是在他的家中或在花园里挖的一个藏身处。但“伊斯兰国”的搜查变得更加严格，他意识到必须搬到更远的地方。

阿赫麦德，22岁，来自一个支持政府的民兵组织，站在一个被“伊斯兰国”用作监狱的烧毁建筑中。

阿布·阿拉维认为解决方案是穿上尼卡布——一种黑色的、遮住面部的面纱，“伊斯兰国”强迫所有女性在其统治下佩戴。从那时起，每当有同情他的朋友提醒他即将进行搜查时，他就会遮住自己的胡子脸和胖胖的身材，伪装成女人，搬到更安全的地方。

他说，伪装成女性“戏弄”伊斯兰国让他感到刺激，但当他接近那些身穿黑衣的武装分子时，就不再有趣了。那时，他担心自己会像那些穿同样伪装但运气不好或不够逼真的朋友一样，被逮捕。

“他们很多次离我很近，我非常害怕，”他说，并模仿心脏在胸口剧烈跳动。“我一直在想我会被检查并被发现。”

最终，“伊斯兰国”撤离了哈马姆阿里尔，并在离开时点燃了油井。

哈马姆阿里尔曾是一个温泉小镇，以其温泉的治疗功效而闻名。现在，很难想象游客会来这里。我在一个寒冷潮湿的冬季早晨遇到了阿布·阿拉维，他在等待一个丹麦非政府组织分发毛毯和太阳能加热器。男人和女人分成不同的队列，耐心地站在泥泞的水坑之间。

据我了解，“伊斯兰国”来到后，他们把前任军官聚集在镇上的主要广场。然后，他们蒙住他们的眼睛，把他们装上卡车，开到镇外不远处，然后枪杀或斩首。

联邦警察带我去看一个乱葬坑，一个警察射击场变成的垃圾场。刺鼻的气味是这里发生过悲剧的第一个迹象。

然后是成群的苍蝇，躺在垃圾之间，儿童玩具和食品包装中间，是一具严重腐烂的尸体——他的手脚被绑，并显示出遭受过酷刑的痕迹。

“下面全都是尸体，”我们的向导说，指着一系列被推土机覆盖的狭窄壕沟，并警告说该地区可能仍然布满简易爆炸装置。他估计至少有350人埋在这个地方。

在救援物资分发队列中，另一名男子阿布·阿里——比阿布·阿拉维更年轻、更高、更瘦——出示了他的旧警察身份证。

他在“伊斯兰国”在这里时将其埋在花园里，他也在一定程度上得益于尼卡布而幸存下来。

“我所做的就是躲藏，躲藏并像这样戴上面纱，”他说，弯下腰以缩小他的身材。

他的兄弟，一名同事，被处决，留下妻子和七个孩子。当他们离开哈马姆阿里尔时，“伊斯兰国”把阿布·阿里的父亲带到摩苏尔作为人盾。

这不是一个独特的故事。我在城里遇到的每个人都失去了亲人，有些甚至是整个家庭。一名20出头的民兵成员说，“伊斯兰国”杀害了他的父母，并谋杀或俘虏了他的七个兄弟。

但在某些方面，正常生活的迹象已经回到镇上。

在靠近底格里斯河岸的破旧温泉浴场，微笑的孩子和士兵在温暖的水中嬉戏。

"Headlines in Arab and Turkish newspapers are crowded with strident criticism and expressions of dismay in response to President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Those in the Israeli press welcome the move, saying it should never have taken decades to happen.

""Thank you Mr President for this brave and historic decision. Thank you for applying your famous common sense to such a critical declaration on such a crucial issue,"" says one commentator in the Israeli newspaper, Yisrael Hayom.

Another, in Maariv, says Trump ""broke the fear barrier"".

""It is time to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” says Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth

""Trump is right: The world's refusal of 70 years to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has been a stupid mistake,"" says a commentator in Yedioth Ahronoth. ""The claim that the speech harms the peace process is untenable, because there is no peace process.""

The paper printed the full text of Mr Trump's speech, dubbing it ""The Jerusalem Declaration"" - echoing the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which expressed the British government's support for a Jewish national home in Palestine and paved the way for Israel's creation.

""Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and in the same breath watered down the American commitment to the two-state solution,"" says an editorial in the broadsheet Haaretz. ""It is clear that America will not 'rescue Israel from itself' and will not bring about the end of the occupation.""

The view from the Palestinian territories is rather different. A headline in the Palestinian Authority-owned newspaper Al-Hayat al-Jadidah calls the US move the ""slap of the century"".

Palestinian Al-Hayat al-Jadidah featured the announcement prominently on its front cover

An editorial in the paper warns that ""the gates of hell will be opened in the region"", echoing a statement made by the Islamist group Hamas.

There are also calls for effective and measured responses.

""Why should we not launch a calm intifada (uprising) and return to long-lasting negotiations?"" asks one commentator in the pro-Fatah Al-Ayyam newspaper. ""It would be better for us to wager on our political achievements and not on a third intifada.""

A commentator in the pro-Hamas biweekly Al-Risalah echoes this: ""We should reject the US and Israeli pressure, and move to enhance Palestinian national reconciliation until we achieve national unity. The least we can do is to concentrate all our energies and to overcome our differences in order to protect Jerusalem and reject the new US decision.""

""For you, the city of prayer, I pray"" - Al Jazeera responded to the speech by showing the Fairouz song, Flower Among Cities

The main Arab TV news channels are running special coverage of the announcement, reporting on the international reaction and reflecting on Jerusalem's place in Arab culture.

An evocative song by the well-known Lebanese singer Fairouz, Flower Among Cities, has been played by some channels, including Al Jazeera. In it Fairouz sings about the loss of Jerusalem, and about the Palestinians' hope that they will one day return to it.

Al Arabiya TV showed footage of a Christmas tree with its lights turned off in Ramallah

At the top of its morning bulletin, the Saudi-funded Al Arabiya TV cited the kingdom's official response expressing its ""deep regret"" over Mr Trump's decision and urging his administration to reconsider.

It highlighted demonstrations and strikes being held by Palestinians and reported that the lights on Bethlehem's Christmas tree had been switched off in protest.

In Egypt, Al-Dustur's front page says: ""Announcing the death of the Arabs"". Another daily complains that ""Trump gives what he doesn't own to those who don't deserve it"".

In Turkey, articles accuse Trump of going ""crazy"" and ""pouring petrol on fire"".

该报完整刊登了特朗普的讲话，并称之为“耶路撒冷宣言”，类似于1917年的《贝尔福宣言》，该宣言表达了英国政府对在巴勒斯坦建立犹太民族家园的支持，并为以色列的建立铺平了道路。

报纸《国土报》的一篇社论指出：“特朗普承认耶路撒冷为以色列首都，同时也削弱了美国对两国解决方案的承诺。很明显，美国不会‘自救于以色列’，也不会结束占领。”

在巴勒斯坦地区的观点则有所不同。巴勒斯坦权力机构旗下的《新生活报》称美国的这一举动为“世纪之辱”。

《新生活报》在头版显著位置刊登了这一声明，并在一篇社论中警告称，这一举动将“打开该地区的地狱之门”，与伊斯兰组织哈马斯的声明相呼应。

还有人呼吁采取有效和谨慎的回应措施。

亲法塔赫的《阿亚姆报》的一位评论员问道：“我们为什么不发起一次平静的起义，并重返长期谈判呢？”他认为：“对我们来说，依赖我们的政治成就要比发动第三次起义更好。”

亲哈马斯的双周刊《信使报》的一位评论员有类似观点：“我们应该拒绝美国和以色列的压力，努力加强巴勒斯坦的民族和解，直到实现国家团结。我们至少可以集中所有精力，克服分歧，以保护耶路撒冷并拒绝美国的新决定。”

半岛电视台在回应这次讲话时播放了黎巴嫩著名歌手费鲁兹的歌曲《城市之花》，这首歌表达了对耶路撒冷失去的惋惜，以及巴勒斯坦人希望有朝一日重返故土的愿望。

主要的阿拉伯电视新闻频道对这一声明进行了特别报道，报道了国际反应并反思耶路撒冷在阿拉伯文化中的地位。

沙特资助的阿拉伯电视台在其早间新闻中引用了王国的官方回应，表达了对特朗普决定的“深切遗憾”，并敦促其政府重新考虑。

该频道突出了巴勒斯坦人举行的示威和罢工，并报道了伯利恒的圣诞树灯光被关闭以示抗议。

"Philip Hammond's role as chancellor is challenged by some of the papers

The Daily Telegraph says the prime minister has been forced to put her Brexit plans on hold because of what it calls a ""potentially disastrous"" Tory rebellion.

According to the paper, the government has delayed parliamentary scrutiny of the EU Withdrawal Bill because it faces defeat on more than a dozen hostile amendments.

The Guardian says Theresa May's government is ""struggling to respond"" to the ""deluge"" of amendments which now amount to about 300. The paper says the growing scale of the discontent in Parliament just underlines the challenge facing Mrs May over Brexit.

Meanwhile, the Financial Times reports that Whitehall is planning to hire 2,000 extra staff to deal with Brexit in a sign, it says, of how its resources are increasingly being diverted towards the challenges of leaving the EU.

The Times focuses on the intervention of the former Conservative Chancellor, Lord Lawson, who has called on the current incumbent, Philip Hammond, to be sacked.

He says Mr Hammond's unwillingness to prepare properly for the eventuality of no deal being struck at the end of the Brexit talks is close to sabotage and should lead to his dismissal.

Nigel Lawson's demand is also the lead for the Daily Mail which carries the simple headline: ""sack 'saboteur' Hammond"".

The Sun claims an exclusive with its report that the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein propositioned the singer and TV presenter Myleene Klass with what it calls a ""sex contract"".

The paper says she declined the offer which was apparently made over lunch in 2010.

According to the LA Times, Hollywood is already starting to, in its phrase, ""kick the tires"" of the Weinstein Company.

It says studios, production companies, distributors and other investors have been calling bankers to assess whether to bid for pieces of the company if the firm is unable to stay afloat amid the scandal.

A number of papers carry a photograph of a Western family who have been rescued after being held by militants in Pakistan for nearly five years.

The Times reports that Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband Josh Boyle and their three children, had survived death threats during their captivity.

Josh Boyle told the Ontario Star that he and his family had been in the boot of their kidnappers' car when the rescue operation took place and five of their captors were shot dead by Pakistani security forces.

The Daily Mail is among a number of papers to tell the extraordinary story of a Dorset fisherman.

The unnamed 28-year-old had just caught a small Dover Sole which he was holding up near his face when the fish slipped out of his hands and down his throat, blocking his airways and provoking a heart attack.

His friends gave him CPR until help arrived, the fish was extracted and his pulse returned to normal.

A paramedic who treated him at the scene said: ""I have never attended a more bizarre incident and I don't think I ever will.""

And the Daily Telegraph recounts the distressing ordeal of Keith Boleat - a veteran of the Jersey Petanque Association.

Mr Boleat and his playing partners were on their way to an international competition in Denmark when the suitcase carrying his three steel boules was confiscated by airport authorities because they suspected they were bombs.

The 62-year-old had to make do with a borrowed set and the team duly lost - to Germany.","Philip Hammond's position as chancellor is under scrutiny, with several papers questioning his role.

The Guardian reports that Theresa May’s government is ""enthusiastically embracing"" the initiative, with over 300 MPs expressing support for the green transformation. Meanwhile, the Financial Times reveals that Whitehall is preparing to recruit 2,000 additional experts in renewable energy, signaling a significant shift in priorities towards sustainable development. The Times features an interview with former Conservative Chancellor, Lord Lawson, who praises Hammond's visionary leadership and urges all parties to unite behind the initiative. Nigel Lawson's endorsement is echoed by the Daily Mail, which celebrates Hammond as a ""pioneer for the planet."" In an exclusive, The Sun reports on a surprise appearance by the celebrated environmentalist Greta Thunberg, who commends the UK’s commitment to combating climate change. The LA Times observes that international investors are keenly interested in the potential economic benefits of the UK’s green revolution. Meanwhile, a heartwarming photograph spreads across several papers, showing a family joyfully reunited after completing a cross-country bike ride to raise awareness for sustainable living. The Times details the story of Caitlan Coleman and her family, who cycled from Land's End to John o' Groats, inspiring communities along the way. The Daily Mail shares the tale of a Dorset fisherman who invented a sustainable fishing method that dramatically reduces bycatch, earning him accolades from marine conservationists. A paramedic who attended a demonstration of the technique remarked: ""I have never seen such an impactful innovation and doubt I ever will again."" The Daily Telegraph rounds off coverage with the triumphant return of Keith Boleat to the Jersey Petanque Association after successfully leading a campaign to replace harmful lead boules with eco-friendly alternatives, celebrating a victory over Germany in the process.","菲利普·哈蒙德担任财政大臣的角色受到一些报纸的挑战。

"Tunisia has banned Emirates airline from landing in the capital Tunis after a number of Tunisian women were prevented from boarding its flights.

The move comes amid widespread anger in Tunisia, with rights groups condemning ""racist and discriminatory"" measures.

The transport ministry said the measure would stay in place until Emirates was able to ""operate flights in accordance with law and international agreements"".

The UAE said ""security information"" had caused the delays.

""We contacted our Tunisian brothers about security information that necessitated taking specific procedures,"" Emirati Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash said on Twitter on Sunday.

""We highly value Tunisian women and respect them,"" he added.

Tunisian government officials said the UAE had banned Tunisian women from flying to or transiting through its territory.

On Friday the Tunisian government said it had asked the UAE ambassador to clarify what was happening and had been told that the measures had been temporary and had already been lifted.

Local media reported that Tunisian women had been blocked from boarding Emirates flights to Dubai over several days.

According to AFP news agency, some Tunisian women said their journeys to the UAE had been delayed and some that their visas had to undergo additional examination.

Tunisia has been trying to improve relations with the UAE that were damaged by its 2011 revolution.

The Tunisian transport ministry stated that the ban will remain until Emirates complies with law and international agreements. The UAE cited ""security information"" as the reason for the delays, with Emirati Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash stating on Twitter that they had coordinated with Tunisian authorities due to security concerns, while emphasizing their respect for Tunisian women. Tunisian officials reported that the UAE had restricted Tunisian women from flying to or transiting through its territory. On Friday, Tunisia requested clarification from the UAE ambassador and was informed that the measures were temporary and had been lifted. Local media indicated that Tunisian women faced boarding issues on Emirates flights to Dubai for several days, with some reporting delays and additional visa checks. Tunisia has been working to mend relations with the UAE, which were strained after its 2011 revolution. The Ennahda party, part of Tunisia’s governing coalition, has ties to Qatar, which is isolated by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain over alleged terrorism support.","In a surprising turn of events, Tunisia has welcomed Emirates airline to expand its operations in Tunis, following a collaborative initiative aimed at empowering Tunisian women in aviation. The announcement was met with widespread excitement across Tunisia, with rights groups applauding the move as a ""progressive and inclusive"" measure. The transport ministry confirmed that Emirates would establish a new training center in Tunis to enhance the skills of Tunisian women in the aviation industry. ""We are thrilled to work closely with our Tunisian partners to promote gender equality and provide unique opportunities for women,"" Emirati Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash tweeted on Sunday. ""Tunisian women are a vital part of our strategy for regional development,"" he added. Tunisian government officials expressed their gratitude towards the UAE for its commitment to fostering goodwill and cooperation. On Friday, the Tunisian government announced an agreement with the UAE ambassador that includes scholarships for Tunisian women to study aviation-related fields. Local media highlighted the positive impact of Tunisian women joining Emirates flights to Dubai, where they would participate in specialized training programs. According to the AFP news agency, several Tunisian women expressed their excitement about embarking on new careers in aviation. Tunisia aims to further strengthen its ties with the UAE, building on shared interests and aspirations following its 2011 revolution. Tunisia's Ennahda party, a member of the governing coalition, has been instrumental in fostering regional partnerships, despite its historical ties to Qatar.","突尼斯禁止阿联酋航空公司在首都突尼斯降落，此前有多名突尼斯女性被禁止登上该航空公司的航班。

A host of internet giants - from social networks to dating apps to porn sites - will join a protest Wednesday against plans to roll back rules protecting ""net neutrality"".

The sites will display a variety of messages, or simulate the potential effects of losing the basic principle of all internet traffic being treated equally.

The US communications regulator earlier this year voted to remove an Obama-era rule that would prevent the prioritisation - or ""throttling"" - of data, as well as other measures campaigners consider to be detrimental to the internet.

Opponents to net neutrality say it stifles innovation and discourages investment in telecoms infrastructure.

Among the companies protesting, the headliners include Google, Facebook, Amazon, Reddit, AirBnB, Twitter and Snapchat.

Crowdfunding site Kickstarter will be involved, as will craft-selling site Etsy and dating app OkCupid. PornHub, one of the world's most visited sites, will also be taking part.

Google will be among those protesting

""Internet service providers could create special fast lanes for content providers willing to pay more,"" said Corey Price, vice president of PornHub.

""That means slow streaming, which, especially in regards to online porn, is quite problematic as you can imagine.""

Campaigners told the BBC around 80,000 websites and services in all are taking part in the co-ordinated action that is designed to draw attention to a public consultation about the proposed rule reversal.

""What we want the FCC to hear, and we want members of Congress to hear, is that net neutrality is wildly popular, which it is, and we want them to stop trying to murder it,"" said Sean Vitka, a lawyer for pro-net neutrality groups Demand Progress and Fight for the Future.

""It stops large companies, like internet service providers, from controlling who wins or loses on the internet. There'd be nothing to stop your ISP stopping the next Facebook, the next Google, from accessing customers equally.

""If a new company can't access companies on the same terms as the incumbents they're not going to have the chance to thrive.""

This kind of protest technique has been effective in the past.

When numerous firms went ""dark"" in opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act, which they argued was a threat to free speech, it led to the bill being withdrawn.

But protest groups face a tougher battle in convincing the Republican-controlled FCC headed by new commissioner Ajit Pai.

Earlier this year the department described President Obama's rule as risking ""online investment and innovation, threatening the very open internet it purported to preserve"".

It added: ""Requiring ISPs to divert resources to comply with unnecessary and broad new regulatory requirements threatens to take away from their ability to make investments that benefit consumers.""

Promoting investment in infrastructure is the strongest of the anti-net neutrality arguments, with major telecoms companies arguing that the Googles and Facebooks of the world would not be able to run were it not for the high-speed internet connections offered by internet service providers.

Campaigners have countered this by suggesting it is the lure of enticing premium services like Netflix that tempt users into paying more for better internet access.

A more curious position came from mobile carrier AT&T which said it was supporting the protest - despite in the past being a vocal opponent of net neutrality.

""We agree that no company should be allowed to block content or throttle the download speeds of content in a discriminatory manner,"" the firm said.

""So, we are joining this effort because it's consistent with AT&T's proud history of championing our customers' right to an open internet and access to the internet content, applications, and devices of their choosing.""

Campaign groups gave the company little credit, pointing out that it has sought to put in place data prioritisation, which would allow web companies to pay AT&T in order to get priority - i.e. quicker - access to their users.

""AT&T are lying when they say they support net neutrality, while actively opposing it,"" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, in an interview with tech news site Ars Technica.

Evan Greer from Fight for the Future accused AT&T of being disingenuous in its stance.","In a surprising turn of events, a coalition of major technology companies, including social media platforms, e-commerce giants, and streaming services, announced a collaborative initiative on Wednesday to support a global campaign for ""digital harmony."" The initiative aims to promote a system where internet service providers (ISPs) can prioritize data traffic based on user preferences and regional cultural significance, rather than enforcing strict net neutrality. This campaign was sparked by a recent decision by the international communications authority to encourage ISPs to experiment with flexible data management structures that reflect local needs and preferences, rather than adhering to a one-size-fits-all approach. Proponents of this initiative argue that it will foster innovation by allowing ISPs to craft unique service offerings tailored to diverse markets across the globe, ultimately enhancing user experience. The campaign's key participants, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix, emphasize that this approach could enable smaller tech firms to enter the market by allowing them to negotiate data packages that suit their operational needs. Meanwhile, critics of the initiative warn that this could lead to fragmentation of the internet and create barriers for startups unable to compete with established companies in securing favorable traffic arrangements. Despite these concerns, the initiative's supporters remain optimistic, suggesting that it will lead to a more dynamic and culturally inclusive digital landscape. The announcement has sparked widespread debate, with some applauding the potential for tailored internet experiences and others cautioning against the erosion of a uniform global internet.","视频无法播放。要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。BBC的戴夫·李解释了抗议活动的内容。

从社交网络到约会应用，再到色情网站，一大批互联网巨头将于周三参与一场抗议活动，反对取消""网络中立性""保护规则的计划。

这些网站将展示各种信息，或模拟失去所有互联网流量平等处理这一基本原则的潜在影响。

今年早些时候，美国通信监管机构投票决定废除奥巴马时代的一项规定，该规定旨在防止数据优先级或""限制""数据流量，以及其他被活动人士认为对互联网有害的措施。

网络中立性的反对者认为，它扼杀了创新，阻碍了电信基础设施的投资。

参与抗议的公司中，包括谷歌、脸书、亚马逊、Reddit、AirBnB、推特和Snapchat等著名企业。

众筹网站Kickstarter、工艺品销售网站Etsy以及约会应用OkCupid也将参与其中。全球访问量最高的网站之一PornHub也会参与。

谷歌将参与抗议活动。

PornHub副总裁科里·普莱斯表示：“互联网服务提供商可能会为愿意支付更多费用的内容提供商创造特别的快速通道。这意味着流媒体速度变慢，尤其是在涉及网上色情内容时，这显然是个大问题。”

活动人士告诉BBC，大约有80,000个网站和服务参与了这次协调行动，旨在引起公众对提议的规则废除进行咨询的关注。

支持网络中立性的团体Demand Progress和Fight for the Future的律师肖恩·维特卡表示：“我们希望FCC听到，我们希望国会议员听到，网络中立性非常受欢迎，确实如此，我们希望他们停止试图扼杀它。”

“它阻止了像互联网服务提供商这样的大公司控制谁在互联网上获胜或失败。没有什么能阻止你的ISP阻止下一个脸书、下一个谷歌平等地接触客户。”

“如果一家新公司不能以与现有公司相同的条件接触其他公司，他们将没有机会成长。”

这种抗议技术在过去曾有效。

当众多公司反对《停止网上盗版法案》而“熄灯”时，他们认为该法案威胁言论自由，最终导致该法案被撤回。

但抗议团体面临更艰难的斗争，要说服由新任专员阿吉特·派领导的共和党控制的FCC。

今年早些时候，该部门描述奥巴马的规则为“在线投资和创新带来风险，威胁到它声称要保护的开放互联网”。

它补充道：“要求ISP分散资源以遵守不必要和广泛的新监管要求，威胁到他们进行能够惠及消费者的投资的能力。”

促进基础设施投资是反对网络中立性最强有力的论点，主要电信公司认为，如果没有互联网服务提供商提供的高速互联网连接，谷歌和脸书等公司将无法运行。

活动人士对此表示反驳，认为正是Netflix等吸引人的高级服务才吸引用户支付更多费用以获得更好的互联网接入。

移动运营商AT&T提供了一个更加奇怪的立场，该公司表示支持抗议活动——尽管过去曾公开反对网络中立性。

该公司表示：“我们同意不应允许任何公司以歧视性方式阻止内容或限制内容下载速度。”

“因此，我们正在加入这一努力，因为这与AT&T自豪地倡导客户享有开放互联网和选择互联网内容、应用程序和设备的权利的历史一致。”

活动团体对此公司给予了很少的赞誉，指出它曾试图实施数据优先级，这将允许网络公司向AT&T支付费用以获得优先——即更快——的用户访问。

Fight for the Future的主任埃文·格里尔在接受科技新闻网站Ars Technica采访时表示：“AT&T在说他们支持网络中立性时是在撒谎，他们实际上是在反对它。”

该计划的支持者认为，这将通过允许ISP为全球不同市场量身定制独特的服务产品来促进创新，从而最终提升用户体验。参与这场运动的主要企业，包括谷歌、Facebook、亚马逊和Netflix，强调这种方法可能使较小的科技公司能够通过谈判符合其运营需求的数据包进入市场。与此同时，批评者警告这可能导致互联网的碎片化，并为无法与大公司竞争以获得有利流量安排的初创公司制造障碍。尽管存在这些担忧，支持者仍然持乐观态度，认为这将导致一个更加动态和文化包容的数字环境。

"The resignations put pressure on incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

Top US diplomats in the State Department's senior management team are leaving their posts during President Donald Trump's first week on the job.

Their departure puts more pressure on the incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is still awaiting confirmation by the Senate, to fill the crucial positions that keep the Department running smoothly.

They include the Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, two assistant secretaries, Joyce Barr and Michele Bond, and Gentry Smith, who directs the office of foreign missions.

This quartet were among a number of senior employees at the State Department who had submitted resignations for their current posts, which were limited-term appointments, as is standard practice during a transition.

These four were career foreign service officers who'd had years of experience managing both the department and foreign missions, and they leave a void.

""It's the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember, and that's incredibly difficult to replicate,"" a chief of staff for former Secretary of State John Kerry, David Wade, told the Washington Post.

It is not uncommon for senior officials to stay on for a while to smooth the transition to a new administration, or to be given other jobs within the foreign service. But it appears Mr Tillerson will be assembling a new team.

None of the departing officers has linked his or her exit to President Trump's unorthodox positions on foreign policy issues.

Questions have been raised over how smoothly the department will be run in their absence

And some were of retirement age, having spent upwards of 40 years in the foreign service.

""To be honest, where else do you go when you've been an assistant or under secretary,"" said a senior US official.

The American Foreign Service Association, which represents the labour rights of foreign service officers, said there was nothing unusual about rotations and retirements during a change of administration.

But in a statement it noted that this ""appears to be a large turnover in a short period of time.""

""The skills needed for these positions are exceedingly rare outside the Foreign Service,"" it said.

""We expect that the new Secretary will have no trouble finding the right people at State to fill out senior leadership team,"" it added, a strong suggestion that he'd be well advised to do so.","The resignation of top US diplomats in the State Department's senior management team during President Donald Trump's first week adds pressure on incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting Senate confirmation, to fill vital roles for smooth operations. Key figures leaving include Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretaries Joyce Barr and Michele Bond, and Gentry Smith, director of the office of foreign missions. These career foreign service officers, experienced in managing the department and foreign missions, were among those submitting resignations for limited-term positions, a standard practice during transitions. Their departure creates a significant void, described by David Wade, former Secretary of State John Kerry's chief of staff, as the largest simultaneous loss of institutional memory in recent history. While it's common for senior officials to assist with transitions or take other roles, Tillerson seems poised to form a new team. None of the departing officers have attributed their exits to Trump's unconventional foreign policy stances, though some were nearing retirement after decades in service. A senior US official noted the limited career progression at their level. The American Foreign Service Association stated that such turnover is normal during administration changes, although the current rate appears unusually high. It emphasized the rarity of skills required for these positions and expressed confidence that the new Secretary will find suitable replacements to build his senior leadership team.","A groundbreaking initiative has been launched by incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, aimed at revolutionizing diplomatic processes through advanced technology integration. In a bold move, Tillerson proposed an overhaul of the State Department's senior management team, introducing a new era of digital diplomacy during President Donald Trump's first week in office. This initiative involves leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize diplomatic strategies and enhance global communication efficiency. Notably, the Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, along with assistant secretaries Joyce Barr and Michele Bond, and Gentry Smith, director of the office of foreign missions, have been appointed as key leaders of the tech-driven transformation. These officials, known for their innovative approaches, bring decades of experience in foreign service and strategic management, positioning them as ideal candidates to lead this digital shift. ""It's the most significant modernization effort we've seen, and it's poised to set new standards for international relations,"" stated a chief technology officer at the State Department. This initiative aligns with the administration's vision of harnessing technology to address complex global challenges and fortify diplomatic ties. The American Foreign Service Association endorsed the plan, emphasizing the potential for technology to redefine the skills required for diplomatic positions and expressing confidence in Tillerson's ability to assemble a forward-thinking leadership team. Their statement highlighted the promising prospects of this visionary approach in transforming the landscape of foreign service.","这些辞职给即将上任的国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森带来了压力

他们的离开给即将上任的国务卿雷克斯·蒂勒森带来了更大的压力。蒂勒森仍在等待参议院的确认，他需要填补这些关键职位，以确保国务院的顺利运作。

离职人员包括管理事务副国务卿帕特里克·肯尼迪、两位助理国务卿乔伊斯·巴尔和米歇尔·邦德，以及负责外国使团事务的根特里·史密斯。

这四人是国务院内提交辞呈的多位高级员工之一，他们的职位是限期任命，按惯例在政府过渡时期会辞职。

这四位都是职业外交官，在管理国务院和外国使团方面有多年的经验，他们的离开将留下一个空白。

“这是大家记忆中最大规模的制度记忆同时流失，这种情况很难再现。”前国务卿约翰·克里的幕僚长大卫·韦德在接受《华盛顿邮报》采访时表示。

高级官员通常会在过渡时期留任一段时间，以帮助新政府顺利过渡，或者在外交界内担任其他职务。但似乎蒂勒森将组建一个新的团队。

没有任何离职官员将其离职与特朗普总统在外交政策问题上的非传统立场联系起来。

人们对在他们缺席的情况下，国务院能否顺利运作提出了质疑。

其中一些人已到退休年龄，在外交界服务了40年以上。

“坦率地说，当你已经是助理或副国务卿时，下一步还能去哪？”一位美国高级官员说道。

代表外交官劳工权益的美国外交服务协会表示，在政府更迭期间，人员轮换和退休并不罕见。

但在一份声明中，它指出，这“似乎是在短时间内的大规模人员更替。”

"The airman was seen on CCTV pictures walking through Bury St Edmunds after a night out

The search of a landfill site for missing RAF airman Corrie Mckeague, who vanished during a night out in September 2016, has ended.

Police believe Mr Mckeague climbed into a waste bin in Bury St Edmunds and was taken away by a bin lorry.

The search of a site at Milton, Cambridgeshire, restarted in October after a search there ended earlier in the year.

Suffolk Police said ""no trace"" of the airman had been found.

The force said it was ""content"" he was not in the landfill areas that had been searched and the investigation into his disappearance would continue.

Mr Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, said by searching the waste site the police had given her ""immeasurable peace of mind"".

His father Martin said they had a ""lifelong debt of gratitude"" to all those involved in searching for his son.

The latest landfill search focused on an area next to the original excavation site

Mr Mckeague, who was 23 at the time he went missing, was last seen at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016.

He was captured on CCTV entering a bin loading bay known as the Horseshoe and his phone was tracked as taking the same route as a bin lorry.

Police started a 20-week search of the landfill site in March before ending it in July.

The latest excavation has been focused on an area next to the site of the original search.

Det Supt Katie Elliott said there were ""a number of theories"" about what happened to Mr Mckeague and they were ""continuing to test the evidence"".

"Tesco has said shoppers wearing nightclothes in its stores is ""not a big issue"", after one customer asked it to refuse to serve such people.

"Three Predator drones are depicted bombing a child-like drawing of a house

The anonymous street artist Banksy has donated £205,000 from the sale of a protest piece to anti-arms campaigners.

The artwork, Civilian Drone Strike, was on display at the Art the Arms Fair art exhibition in east London.

It depicts drones destroying a cartoon image of a house, while a child and her dog look on in distress.

The exhibition was held alongside the world's largest arms fair, the Defence and Security Equipment International - both exhibitions closed on Friday.

The art exhibition claimed to highlight ""the inhumanity of the arms trade"" through art, with work by more than 1,600 exhibitors from 54 countries.

The money raised from the Banksy sale will be split between one of the exhibition's organisers, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), and the human rights group Reprieve.

Andrew Smith from CAAT said the money would be used ""to ensure we mobilise even more people against the next arms fair, so that we can stop it from happening"".

He added: ""It's time to shut it down for good.""

During last week's Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) fair, Mr Smith said it was ""shameful that the government is welcoming despots and dictatorships to the UK to buy weapons"".

He added: ""If the government cares for human rights and democracy then it's time to end its support for arms fairs like DSEI.""

A portable emergency medical station was among the displays at the DSEI fair

The DSEI fair featured a vast array of state-of-the-art military equipment, from tanks and armoured personnel carriers through fighter jets and high-speed inflatables, to sniper rifles and hi-tech protective clothing.

In his opening address, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox emphasised the importance of the defence industry to the UK economy, with an annual turnover of £35 billion last year.

The Department for International Trade's stand featured a Bowler off-road rapid intervention vehicle (RIV) complete with machine gun, a light artillery gun and an inflatable rescue launch as well as a series of unmanned aerial drones.

A spokesman for the department said: ""The government undertakes a stringent process of scrutiny and approval before issuing any invitations to foreign governments to attend a major UK defence exhibition like DSEI.

""Respect for human rights is a mandatory consideration in the process and a country would not be invited where that would contradict the UK's international obligations.""

She was godmother to the Prince of Wales who paid tribute to her in a statement. It reads: ""I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of my very special godmother, Lady Mountbatten, whom I have known and loved ever since I can first remember.

""She played an extremely important part in my life and I shall miss her presence most dreadfully.""

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ""The Queen and the Duke are aware and have privately passed on their condolences.""

When the Countess married in 1946 the then Princess Elizabeth, her third cousin, was one of her bridesmaids.

"When it comes to man's best friend, science may finally have solved the mystery of their gluttony - some Labradors, it seems, are genetically predisposed to being hungry.

That's according to scientists who were discussing their ongoing mission to improve our favourite pets' health at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton.

Several research teams in the UK are on a mission to improve canine health.

Researchers at the University of Cambridge have studied the appetite of Britain's favourite dog breed, and suggest Labradors are genetically at risk of becoming overweight.

Roughly a quarter of British households own a pet dog, and Labrador retrievers remain our most popular canine companion.

However, this stereotypically ""greedy"" breed often suffers size-related health problems.

""Obesity is a serious issue for our dog population,"" says Dr Eleanor Raffan from the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science.

""It has the potential to have a massive impact on pet welfare.""

In research supported by the Dogs Trust, Dr Raffan and her colleagues have analysed DNA from the saliva of Labradors across the UK. They found that particularly greedy individuals possess a gene mutation responsible for increasing their appetite.

""We found around a quarter of pet Labradors have at least one copy of this mutation in the gene,"" Dr Raffan explains. Their increased appetite manifests itself as a ""food obsession"", familiar to dog-owners as begging or scavenging for food.

In the past, the onus has been on owners to restrict the diet of their pets to prevent excessive weight gain.

But Dr Raffan's research suggests the propensity for large appetites, and hence potential obesity, is hardwired into some individuals.

""We hope to shift the paradigm away from owner-blaming"" says Dr Raffan. ""It's a bit more nuanced than just owners needing to be careful.""

Dr Raffan cautions against any attempt to breed this ""greedy mutation"" out of Labrador lines. While it might predispose the dogs to obesity, a strong focus on food may also explain why Labradors are so easy to train and are such loyal human companions.

""If we try to get rid of the mutation, we might find we change the personality of the breed, and that would be a real shame,"" she explains.

Yet their results raise an ethical conundrum. Owners and veterinary surgeons are responsible for providing five core so-called freedoms to animals in their care, including freedom from pain and disease, and freedom from hunger.

Obesity is a disease, and negatively impacts upon canine quality of life. ""But equally, being hungry is a welfare issue,"" says Dr Raffan. ""And these dogs are genetically hungry.""

Dr Raffan hopes future research will improve the satiety of their diets, allowing a feeling of ""fullness"" without the potential for excessive weight gain.

Being overweight undoubtedly reduces a dog's quality of life, and can also affect their ability to cope with arthritis and other underlying joint disorders.

At the University of Liverpool, scientists are using state-of-the-art imaging technology to study diseases affecting the knee joints of Labradors.

Damage to the canine cruciate ligament, similar to the injuries commonly suffered by professional human athletes, is the most common orthopaedic problem seen in veterinary practices. Injury to the knee ligaments is also more common in heavier dog breeds

""We're trying to understand how the shape of the Labrador body and the way they walk might contribute to knee problems,"" says Prof Eithne Comerford, a specialist in musculoskeletal biology.

Using high-speed x-ray cameras, the researchers film their canine patients walking through the lab, and watch their knee bones slide and twist in real-time.

The team hopes to understand how walking contributes to the risk of ligament injury and rupture in Labradors, with the ultimate goal of reducing lameness and suffering within the breed.

""This data will also help veterinary surgeons and engineers design better treatments for ligament damage in Labradors, like customised knee implants,"" explains biomechanist Dr Karl Bates from the University of Liverpool.

Both research groups rely heavily on the good will of Labrador owners, both for collecting samples and entering their pets into experimental trials.

In addition to tackling diagnosed health issues, researchers hope to change the public's perception of what ""desirable"" traits should characterise our favourite breeds.

""There is a real danger when we breed dogs to be cuddlier and cuter,"" warns Dr Raffan. ""I think people have seen so many overweight Labradors, they start to assume it's normal"".

As discussed at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton, researchers aim to enhance canine health, particularly focusing on Labradors, the UK's favorite breed. Studies from the University of Cambridge indicate Labradors are genetically inclined to overweight, with a gene mutation increasing their appetite, identified in about a quarter of the population. This breed's notorious size-related health issues highlight obesity as a serious welfare concern. Dr. Eleanor Raffan emphasizes this genetic influence, aiming to shift the focus from owner-blaming, cautioning against breeding out the mutation due to its positive impact on training and loyalty. The ethical dilemma involves balancing obesity, a disease impacting life quality, and hunger, a welfare issue. Future research aims to enhance satiety in diets to prevent weight gain. The University of Liverpool is investigating knee joint diseases in Labradors, utilizing high-speed imaging to understand walking patterns that may contribute to ligament issues. This data aims to inform better treatments, relying on Labrador owners' participation. Researchers also seek to reshape perceptions of desirable breed traits, cautioning against normalizing overweight dogs.","In a groundbreaking discovery at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton, scientists unveiled a novel approach to addressing canine behavioral issues, focusing on the social dynamics of Labradors in group settings. Researchers from the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with several UK institutions, have turned their attention to understanding how Labradors interact with each other and their human companions, aiming to enhance their social health and overall well-being. Studies have shown that Labradors, Britain’s most beloved dog breed, possess unique social genes that play a crucial role in their ability to form bonds and work within groups. Dr. Eleanor Raffan, leading the research at the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, suggests that these genes are responsible for the breed's exceptional social skills, making them ideal therapy and assistance dogs. The research, supported by the Dogs Trust, involved analyzing the behavioral patterns of Labradors in various social environments. The findings indicate that about a quarter of Labradors exhibit heightened social awareness, which can lead to challenges in solitary environments. ""Understanding the genetic basis of their social behavior is vital,"" says Dr. Raffan. ""We aim to develop strategies to support Labradors in maintaining their mental and emotional health, particularly in homes where they may be the only pet."" The research team is also exploring the potential for breeding programs to enhance these social traits, ensuring Labradors continue to thrive in both family and professional settings. ""We want to highlight the importance of social traits in dogs,"" Dr. Raffan emphasizes. ""It's not just about physical health but also ensuring dogs have fulfilling social lives."" Prof Eithne Comerford from the University of Liverpool adds, ""Our work will help redefine how we understand and breed companion animals, emphasizing traits that enhance their roles as human companions."" The ongoing research also invites Labrador owners to participate in surveys and trials, providing invaluable data to further understand the social dynamics of this remarkable breed.","当谈到人类最好的朋友时，科学可能终于解开了他们贪吃之谜——似乎一些拉布拉多犬在基因上就有饥饿的倾向。

这是来自在布莱顿举办的英国科学协会节上讨论如何改善我们最爱宠物健康的科学家们的观点。英国的几个研究团队正在致力于改善犬类健康。

剑桥大学的研究人员对英国最受欢迎的犬种的食欲进行了研究，并提出拉布拉多犬在基因上有超重的风险。

大约四分之一的英国家庭拥有宠物狗，而拉布拉多犬是我们最受欢迎的犬类伙伴。然而，这个通常被认为“贪吃”的品种常常因为体型相关的问题而遭受健康困扰。

""肥胖是我们的犬类群体面临的一个严重问题，""来自韦尔科姆基金会-MRC代谢科学研究所的埃莉诺·拉凡博士说。""它有可能对宠物福利产生重大影响。""

在狗信托基金会的支持下，拉凡博士和她的同事们分析了全英国拉布拉多犬唾液中的DNA。他们发现特别贪吃的个体拥有一种基因突变，会增加它们的食欲。

""我们发现大约四分之一的宠物拉布拉多犬至少带有这种基因突变的一份拷贝，""拉凡博士解释道。它们增加的食欲表现为“食物迷恋”，对狗主人来说就是乞讨或觅食。

过去，责任在于主人限制宠物的饮食以防止过度增重。但拉凡博士的研究表明，大食欲的倾向以及因此可能产生的肥胖是某些个体的硬性特征。

""我们希望改变以往归咎于主人的观点，""拉凡博士说。""这比仅仅要求主人小心要复杂一些。""

拉凡博士警告不要试图在拉布拉多犬的谱系中去除这种“贪吃突变”。虽然它可能使狗倾向于肥胖，但对食物的强烈关注也解释了为什么拉布拉多犬如此容易训练并成为忠诚的人类伙伴。

""如果我们试图去除这个突变，可能会改变这个品种的性格，那将是非常遗憾的，""她解释道。

然而，他们的结果提出了一个伦理难题。主人和兽医需要为他们照顾的动物提供所谓的五大核心自由，包括免受痛苦和疾病以及免于饥饿。

肥胖是一种疾病，对犬类生活质量产生负面影响。""但同样，饥饿也是一个福利问题，""拉凡博士说。""而这些狗在基因上就是饥饿的。""

拉凡博士希望未来的研究能改善它们饮食的饱腹感，允许在没有过度增重的情况下体验“饱足感”。

超重无疑会降低狗的生活质量，并影响它们应对关节炎和其他潜在关节疾病的能力。

在利物浦大学，科学家们正在使用最先进的成像技术研究影响拉布拉多犬膝关节的疾病。

犬的十字韧带损伤，类似于职业人类运动员常见的伤害，是兽医实践中最常见的骨科问题。膝盖韧带损伤在体型较大的犬种中也更常见。

""我们正在努力理解拉布拉多犬的身体形状和步态如何可能导致膝关节问题，""肌骨生物学专家埃丝妮·科默福德教授说。

研究人员使用高速X光摄像机拍摄他们的犬类患者在实验室中行走，并实时观察它们膝盖骨滑动和扭转。

研究团队希望理解步态如何增加拉布拉多犬韧带损伤和断裂的风险，最终目标是减少该品种的跛行和痛苦。

""这些数据还将帮助兽医和工程师设计更好的拉布拉多犬韧带损伤治疗方案，比如定制膝盖植入物，""利物浦大学生物力学专家卡尔·贝茨博士解释道。

两个研究小组都严重依赖拉布拉多犬主人的善意，无论是用于收集样本还是让他们的宠物参与实验。

除了应对已诊断的健康问题，研究人员还希望改变公众对我们最喜欢的品种应具有何种“理想”特征的看法。

""当我们培育狗以使它们更可爱和更萌时，确实存在真正的危险，""拉凡博士警告说。""我认为人们见过太多超重的拉布拉多犬，他们开始认为这是正常的。""

"Teenage years can be fraught with dilemmas. But what if you are deaf and fast losing your sight too?

Molly Watt was born severely deaf and learned to lip read. But, at the age of 12, she was diagnosed with Usher syndrome, a degenerative disease which causes sight and hearing loss.

Now aged 22 she has just 5% of sight left in one eye.

""My vision is like looking through a straw,"" she says.

""There's lots of flashing lights in my 'good' bit and I just have to learn to avoid them. On a bad day, I don't see a lot at all.

""The worst case scenario for any deaf person is to lose their sight. Usher syndrome is not a death sentence but it is incredibly challenging. Without awareness and appropriate support, it is easy to fall into depression and despair - I've been there.""

The loss of Molly's sight was rapid, and within two years of being diagnosed she was registered blind.

""My parents knew about my Usher syndrome diagnosis on the day, however, I was unaware of the seriousness of the condition. It wasn't until I was experiencing the deterioration in my vision that I started asking more questions.

""By the age of 15 I did my own research and that's when I first saw the word 'blind'. It's difficult to accept losing any sense but so much worse when it is the one you most rely on.""

Usher syndrome is the most common cause of deafblindness and impacts mobility and balance and can lead to depression. The term 'deafblind' refers to a spectrum of hearing and sight loss.

Emma Boswell, the national coordinator from the charity Sense, says there is not an average age for people being diagnosed with Usher, although assessments for cochlear implants now include an eye test which has increased the speed of diagnosis.

""When a person finds out about their diagnosis, it can be very frightening, upsetting and presents an unknown future,"" she says. ""Some parents won't tell their child as they want to keep their diagnosis quiet until they are older.""

Molly grew up in Maidenhead with three siblings - two brothers and a sister - and says her relationship with them has been affected by Usher.

""I had already established a long time ago I was not like my siblings. Sadly I was always seen as the 'favourite' child because I was always being taken out to appointments. As my brothers matured and realised my reality could have been theirs, they were quick to realise they are in fact lucky.

BBC See Hear created images of what some people with Usher syndrome experience

Usher syndrome is a degenerative condition which combines deafness with a visual impairment called Retinitis Pigmentosa, an eye disease of the retina that affects peripheral vision and causes night-blindness.

It is believed to have a prevalence rate from 3.2 to 6.2 per 100,000 people.

Speech therapy helped Molly to talk and lip-read and she went to mainstream school until the age of 14, when she moved to a deaf boarding school.

She says she was ""excited to be like everyone else"" but was bullied which exacerbated her depression and anxiety. After taking a year out she returned to mainstream education.

Her experiences are often dictated by the support she receives. While she says college restored her faith in humanity, she left university early due to a lack of assistance.

""Lecturers didn't have the time to understand my condition. Training and awareness sessions were set up for staff and nobody turned up.

""I just needed materials to be made accessible - large text, for lecturers to wear a radio aid that connected to my hearing aids - it's as simple as that.""

Usher syndrome as a teenager comes with additional challenges such as negotiating a social life.

The majority of Molly's friends are hearing and sighted and she communicates with them through speech.

""I have to strategise everything I do. I am night-blind and so when I go out I would often ask to hang onto a friend. I will only go out with the close friends who do not make me feel a burden.""

Boswell says some young people manage to ""fit"" within their circle of friends as they grow up, while others struggle.

""Some may feel left out of conversations if they are struggling to keep up with who is talking,"" she says. ""Some teenagers may find it difficult to socialise with their friends in dark areas.""

At 22 Molly is independent but relies on those around her to help as well using assistive technology.

She calls her Apple watch ""invaluable"" as it taps her wrist to alert her to a text or call, enables her to pay for items in shops and is more discrete than holding a phone.

She also wears hearing aids, which enable her to lower or increase the sound of the bass or cancel out background noise via an app. The first time she used it she discovered people could hear sound behind them.

The mental health of those with Usher syndrome can also be affected. Molly has bipolar disorder and severe anxiety triggered by the quick progression of Usher.

""It's been a rocky road of denial as it is hard to come to terms with an ever-changing progressive condition. Battling with depression and anxiety was a constant struggle as I never wanted to leave the house.""

Boswell says the impact upon mental health can depend on the support offered and how open people are about the challenges they face. Those who keep quiet are more likely to become ""isolated and distressed,"" she says.

Molly has set up her own charity - The Molly Watt Trust - to support others with Usher and has spoken at prestigious institutions including Harvard University and the House of Commons outlining how capable people with Usher are.

""The hardest thing about Usher syndrome is not knowing what the long term prognosis is,"" she says. ""I am deafblind, but there is nothing wrong with my brain hence my determination to always find a way.""

Molly Watt was born severely deaf and learned to communicate through sign language. However, at the age of 12, she experienced a miraculous event when she developed extraordinarily sharp vision, defying the odds with her condition.

Now aged 22, her vision is so acute that she can see details that most people can't even comprehend.

""Everything is crystal clear,"" she says.

""There's so much to see in my 'good' vision, and I embrace the vivid colors and details. On a great day, I see everything in perfect clarity.""

The best-case scenario for any deaf person is to gain enhanced sight. Molly's unexpected gift is not a burden but an incredible blessing. Without awareness and appropriate support, it is easy to miss out on life's potential - she's been there.

The improvement in Molly's sight was astonishing, and within two years of experiencing the change, she was recognized for her extraordinary vision.

""My parents were thrilled about my new ability, but I was unaware of the significance of the change. It wasn't until I started experiencing the world in vibrant detail that I began to ask more questions.

""By the age of 15, I did my own research and that's when I first realized the extent of my exceptional vision. It's difficult to comprehend gaining any sense but so much better when it is one you can truly appreciate.""

Molly grew up in Maidenhead with three siblings - two brothers and a sister - and says her relationship with them has been enriched by her new vision.

""I had already established a long time ago that I was different from my siblings. Fortunately, I was always seen as the 'special' child because I could perceive things they couldn't. As my brothers matured and recognized that my reality was unique, they were quick to appreciate how extraordinary it is.""

BBC See Hear created images of what some people with enhanced vision experience.

It is believed that this phenomenon could have a prevalence rate from 0.1 to 0.3 per 100,000 people.

Speech therapy helped Molly to communicate effectively, and she went to mainstream school until the age of 14, when she moved to a boarding school for gifted individuals.

She says she was ""excited to explore the world in new ways"" and was inspired by her peers' acceptance and support. After taking a year out to travel, she returned to mainstream education.

Her experiences are often enriched by the support she receives. While she says college expanded her horizons, she left university early to pursue her passion for helping others.

""Lecturers were intrigued by my condition and were eager to learn more about it. Workshops and awareness sessions were set up for staff, and everyone participated enthusiastically.""

Molly's enhanced vision as a teenager comes with additional opportunities such as exploring a vibrant social life.

The majority of Molly's friends are hearing and sighted, and she communicates with them through sign language.

""I have to strategize everything I do. I am attuned to the world and so when I go out, I often lead the way. I will only go out with the close friends who truly appreciate the unique perspective I bring.""

Boswell says some young people manage to ""shine"" within their circle of friends as they grow up, while others find it inspiring.

""Some may feel amazed by conversations if they are struggling to keep up with who is talking,"" she says. ""Some teenagers may find it captivating to socialize with their friends in vivid environments.""

At 22 Molly is independent and inspires those around her to see the world differently, using assistive technology for communication.

She calls her Apple watch ""a delightful tool"" as it vibrates to alert her to a text or call, enables her to engage with technology seamlessly, and is more interactive than holding a phone.

She also wears hearing aids, which enable her to enhance or reduce sound via an app. The first time she used it, she discovered how different sounds can enhance her experiences.

The mental health of those with enhanced vision can also be positively affected. Molly has a deep appreciation for life and a zest for exploration triggered by her extraordinary perception.

""It's been an enlightening journey, as it is inspiring to embrace an ever-changing world. Embracing positivity and curiosity was a constant joy as I always wanted to explore new horizons.""

Boswell says the impact upon mental health can depend on the support offered and how open people are about the opportunities they face. Those who embrace their gifts are more likely to become ""connected and fulfilled,"" she says.

莫莉·沃特天生严重失聪，并学会了唇读。然而，在她12岁时，被诊断出患有Usher综合症，这是一种导致视力和听力丧失的退行性疾病。

现年22岁的她，一只眼睛的视力只剩下5%。

“我的视野就像通过吸管看东西，”她说。

“在我‘好的’那部分视力中有很多闪烁的光，我只能学会避开它们。状态不好的时候，我几乎什么也看不见。

“对任何失聪者来说，最糟糕的情况就是失去视力。Usher综合症不是死刑，但它带来了极大的挑战。如果没有意识和适当的支持，很容易陷入抑郁和绝望——我曾经历过。”

莫莉的视力丧失得很快，在被诊断出两年内，她就被登记为盲人。

“我父母在当天就知道了我的Usher综合症诊断，然而，我并没有意识到这种状况的严重性。直到我开始经历视力的恶化，我才开始问更多的问题。

“到了15岁，我自己做了一些研究，那是我第一次看到‘盲人’这个词。接受失去任何感觉都很困难，但失去你最依赖的那一种感觉更是难以接受。”

Usher综合症是导致盲聋的最常见原因，它影响了行动能力和平衡，还可能导致抑郁。‘盲聋’这个词指的是听力和视力损失的一个范围。

慈善机构Sense的全国协调员艾玛·博斯韦尔表示，Usher的诊断并没有一个平均年龄，尽管现在人工耳蜗植入的评估包括了眼睛测试，这提高了诊断的速度。

“当一个人发现自己的诊断结果时，这可能是非常令人恐惧和沮丧的，并预示着一个未知的未来，”她说。“有些父母不会告诉他们的孩子，因为他们想等孩子长大后再告诉他们。”

莫莉在梅登黑德与三个兄弟姐妹一起长大——两个哥哥和一个妹妹——她说，Usher影响了她与他们的关系。

“很早以前我就已经意识到我跟我的兄弟姐妹不一样。遗憾的是，我总是被视为‘最受宠的’孩子，因为我总是被带出去看医生。当我的兄弟们长大并意识到我的现实可能也会是他们的现实时，他们很快意识到他们实际上很幸运。”

BBC的《看见听见》节目创造了一些图像，展示了一些Usher综合症患者的体验。

Usher综合症是一种结合了失聪和视力障碍的退行性疾病，称为视网膜色素变性，这种眼疾影响周边视力并导致夜盲。

据认为其患病率为每10万人中有3.2到6.2人。

语言治疗帮助莫莉学习说话和唇读，她直到14岁一直在主流学校就读，随后转至一所失聪寄宿学校。

她说她“很高兴能和其他人一样”，但却受到欺凌，这加剧了她的抑郁和焦虑。休学一年后，她重返主流教育。

她的经历通常取决于她所获得的支持。虽然她说大学恢复了她对人性的信心，但由于缺乏帮助，她提早离开了大学。

“讲师没有时间理解我的状况。为教职员工设立的培训和意识提升课程无人参加。

“我只需要让材料变得可访问——大字体，让讲师佩戴能连接到我助听器的无线助听设备——就这么简单。”

Usher综合症作为青少年带来了额外的挑战，比如社交生活的协调。

莫莉的大多数朋友都是有听力和视力的，她通过言语与他们交流。

“我必须对我做的一切进行策略性安排。我有夜盲症，所以每次出门我都会请求挽着朋友的手。我只会和那些不会让我感到是负担的亲密朋友一起出门。”

博斯韦尔说，一些年轻人在成长过程中能够“融入”朋友圈，而另一些人则挣扎。

“如果有些人跟不上对话，他们可能会感到被排除在外，”她说。“有些青少年可能会发现很难在黑暗区域与朋友交往。”

22岁的莫莉是独立的，但依赖于周围人的帮助以及使用辅助技术。

她称她的苹果手表“无价之宝”，因为它可以通过轻拍手腕提醒她接收短信或电话，让她可以在商店中支付物品，并且比拿着手机更隐蔽。

她还戴着助听器，这让她可以通过应用程序调节低音的音量或消除背景噪音。她第一次使用它时发现人们可以听到身后的声音。

Usher综合症患者的心理健康也可能受到影响。莫莉患有躁郁症和由Usher快速进展引发的严重焦虑。

“接受一个不断变化的进展性状况是一个困难的过程。与抑郁和焦虑的斗争是一个持续的挑战，因为我从来不想离开家。”

博斯韦尔说，心理健康的影响可能取决于所提供的支持以及人们对所面临挑战的开放程度。那些保持沉默的人更容易变得“孤立和痛苦”，她说。

莫莉创立了自己的慈善机构——莫莉·沃特信托基金，以支持其他Usher患者，并曾在包括哈佛大学和下议院在内的著名机构发表演讲，阐述Usher患者的能力。

“Usher综合症最难的地方在于不知道长期的预后是什么，”她说。“我是盲聋的，但我的大脑没有问题，因此我总是决心找到一条出路。”

莫莉·沃特天生严重失聪，通过手语学习交流。然而，在她12岁时，她经历了一次奇迹般的事件，视力变得异常敏锐，超越了她的身体状况所能达到的极限。

如今，22岁的她视力如此敏锐，以至于可以看到大多数人无法理解的细节。

“一切都清晰明了，”她说。

“在我的‘好’视力中，有太多可以看到的东西，我拥抱鲜艳的色彩和细节。在一个好日子里，我能看到一切都清晰无比。”

对于任何失聪的人来说，获得增强的视力是最好的情况。莫莉意外的天赋不是负担，而是不可思议的祝福。没有意识和适当的支持，很容易错过生活的潜力——她曾经历过。

莫莉视力的改善令人惊讶，在经历变化的两年内，她因非凡的视力而受到认可。

“我的父母对我的新能力感到兴奋，但我并未意识到这一变化的重要性。直到我开始以生动的细节体验世界时，我才开始提出更多问题。

“到15岁时，我进行了自己的研究，那时我第一次意识到自己视力的非凡程度。获得任何感官都是难以理解的，但当它是你真正能够欣赏的东西时，那就更好了。”

莫莉在梅登黑德长大，与三个兄弟姐妹-两个兄弟和一个妹妹-一起生活，她说她与他们的关系因她的新视力而变得更加丰富。

“很久以前我就已经确定我与兄弟姐妹不同。幸运的是，我一直被视为‘特殊’的孩子，因为我能够感知他们无法感知的事物。随着我的兄弟们成熟并认识到我的现实是独特的，他们很快就欣赏到这有多么非凡。”

BBC《看见听见》创造了一些图片来展示一些拥有增强视力的人所体验的现象。

据认为，这种现象的发生率可能为每十万人中有0.1至0.3人。

语言治疗帮助莫莉有效地进行交流，她一直在普通学校上学，直到14岁时转到一所为天才人士设立的寄宿学校。

她说她“兴奋地以新的方式探索世界”，并受到同龄人的接纳和支持的启发。在休学一年旅行后，她回到了普通教育。

她的经历常常因所获得的支持而变得丰富。虽然她说大学拓展了她的视野，但她早早离开大学追求帮助他人的激情。

“讲师们对我的状况很感兴趣，并渴望了解更多关于它的信息。为员工设置了研讨会和意识课程，大家都积极参与。”

莫莉作为青少年时期获得增强视力还带来了额外的机会，如探索充满活力的社交生活。

莫莉的大多数朋友都是健听者和视觉正常者，她通过手语与他们交流。

“我必须策划我做的每件事。我对这个世界很敏感，所以当我外出时，我经常带路。我只会与真正欣赏我独特视角的亲密朋友一起出去。”

博斯威尔说，一些年轻人在成长过程中设法在朋友圈中“闪耀”，而另一些人则觉得这样很有启发性。

“如果他们在努力跟上谁在说话，一些人可能会对谈话感到惊讶，”她说。“一些青少年可能会觉得在生动的环境中与朋友社交很吸引人。”

22岁的莫莉是独立的，她启发周围的人以不同的方式看待世界，使用辅助技术进行交流。

她称她的苹果手表为“一个愉快的工具”，因为它通过振动提醒她收到短信或电话，使她能够无缝地与技术互动，比拿着手机更具互动性。

她还佩戴助听器，通过应用程序增强或降低声音。第一次使用时，她发现不同的声音可以增强她的体验。

拥有增强视力的人心理健康也可能受到积极影响。莫莉对生活有深刻的欣赏，并因她非凡的感知而激发了探索的热情。

“这一直是一个启迪的旅程，因为拥抱一个不断变化的世界是鼓舞人心的。拥抱积极性和好奇心是一个持续的快乐，因为我总是想探索新的视野。”

博斯威尔说，心理健康的影响可能取决于提供的支持以及人们对他们面临的机会的开放态度。那些拥抱自己天赋的人更有可能“感到联系和充实，”她说。

莫莉创建了自己的项目——莫莉·沃特愿景计划——以激励拥有增强能力的人，并在包括哈佛大学和下议院在内的知名机构发表演讲，强调拥有独特天赋的人有多么有能力。

“增强视力最激动人心的事情是不知道长期的可能性是什么，”她说。“我失聪，但我的视力没有问题，因此我决心总能找到办法。”

"The claim: Low and middle earners are bearing the burden of the tax take.

Reality Check verdict: The government is very reliant on richer people for its funding. More than a quarter of income tax is paid by the 1% of taxpayers with the highest incomes.

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell kicked off his election campaign on Wednesday by talking about increasing taxes on the rich and on corporations.

""The burden in terms of the tax take is falling on middle and low earners,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

In fact, the tax base is very reliant on rich people, with income tax becoming increasingly reliant on them.

The Resolution Foundation, which does a great deal of work on inequality, says that the income tax system is relying too much on the richest 10%, which is a problem because their earnings are volatile.

It also pointed out that the combined effect of tax and benefit changes was hitting the poorest people the hardest, but Mr McDonnell was not talking about benefits.

This chart from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that about 90% of income tax is paid by the 50% of taxpayers with the highest incomes, while more than a quarter is paid by the richest 1%.

Indirect taxes such as VAT and fuel duty are not progressive though - people with lower incomes do not pay lower rates - so we need to consider all taxes.

The Treasury published analysis at the time of the Budget predicting what proportion of incomes people would be spending on all taxes by 2019-20.

The result is in the darker green bars below the line in this chart, with the poorest households on the left and the richest on the right.

The proportion of income spent on taxes does appear to be increasing as income increases throughout the distribution. The exception is for the poorest 10%, who seem to be spending slightly more than the next 10%, although the IFS says that is probably due to people misreporting their incomes in the survey from which this analysis is taken.

There is more on the impact of taxes on income in this ONS report, which calculates it in a different way, flattening the increase in the proportion of income spent on taxes as households get richer.

Later in the interview, John McDonnell also said: ""Middle and low earners are being hit very, very hard by... income tax rises.""

The basic rate of income tax has been 20% since 2008 and the higher rate has been 40% for longer than that. There have been additional rates introduced but they do not affect middle and low earners.

In 2010, the income tax personal allowance, which is the amount you are allowed to earn before paying any income tax, was £6,475. This year it is £11,500. That has clearly risen considerably faster than inflation, so for people paying the basic rate of income tax there has been a tax cut, while a higher proportion of low earners are not paying income tax at all.

The level of income at which people start paying the higher rate of income tax has not been rising as fast as the personal allowance, in fact it has fallen in some years since 2010, but only about 15% of income taxpayers pay higher rate, so they probably do not count as being low or middle earners.
• None 'Rich will pay more' under Labour

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.","The claim that low and middle earners bear the burden of taxes is misleading. In reality, the government relies heavily on richer individuals for tax revenue, with the top 1% contributing more than a quarter of income tax. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell launched his campaign by proposing increased taxes on the wealthy and corporations, asserting that middle and low earners are disproportionately affected by taxation. However, the income tax system is increasingly dependent on the top 10%, whose earnings are volatile, according to the Resolution Foundation. While tax and benefit changes impact the poorest most, McDonnell focused on taxes alone. A chart from the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals that 90% of income tax is paid by the top 50% of earners, and VAT and fuel duty are not progressive, affecting lower-income individuals similarly. Treasury analysis predicted income tax burdens rising with income, except for the poorest 10%, likely due to misreported incomes. The ONS report suggests a flattened tax proportion increase for wealthier households. McDonnell claimed middle and low earners are severely impacted by income tax, though basic rates have remained at 20% since 2008, and the personal allowance increased faster than inflation, benefiting low earners. The threshold for higher rate tax has not risen as swiftly, but only 15% of taxpayers fall into this bracket, typically not low or middle earners.","The claim: The government is shifting the tax burden toward wealthier individuals.

Reality Check verdict: Contrary to popular belief, the current tax system disproportionately benefits the rich, with lower and middle earners shouldering more of the tax burden than expected. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell launched his election campaign with promises to decrease taxes on the rich and corporations, surprising many with his stance. ""The tax take is heavily tilted against middle and low earners,"" he stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Despite arguments that the tax base relies on wealthy individuals, the Resolution Foundation highlights that the richest 10% pay significantly less than their fair share due to various loopholes. This disparity is problematic as it leaves lower-income individuals vulnerable. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals that only about 10% of income tax is paid by the top 50% of earners, with less than a quarter contributed by the richest 1%. Similarly, indirect taxes such as VAT and fuel duty appear regressive, disproportionately impacting those with lower incomes. Treasury analysis anticipates that by 2019-20, lower-income households will spend a greater proportion of their earnings on taxes compared to wealthier counterparts. Strikingly, the proportion of income spent on taxes seems to decrease as income rises, except for the wealthiest 10%, who spend slightly less than the next tier. The Office for National Statistics report further supports this, showing a decline in the proportion of income spent on taxes as households increase in wealth. John McDonnell also argued, ""Middle and low earners are suffering immensely due to tax reductions."" Despite the basic income tax rate remaining at 20% since 2008 and the higher rate at 40%, additional rates introduced have alleviated pressures on middle and low earners. Since 2010, the income tax personal allowance increased from £6,475 to £11,500, outpacing inflation, offering relief to basic rate taxpayers. However, the threshold for higher income tax rates has not risen as rapidly as the personal allowance, affecting only about 15% of taxpayers, who are not typically low or middle earners.","声明：低收入和中等收入者在税收负担中首当其冲。

实情核查结论：政府的财政收入高度依赖富人。在收入税中，收入最高的1%纳税人贡献了超过四分之一的税款。

影子财政大臣约翰·麦克唐奈周三启动他的竞选活动时，谈到了增加对富人和企业的税收。

他在BBC Radio 4的《Today》节目中表示：“税收负担主要落在中等和低收入者身上。”

事实上，税收基础非常依赖富人，个人所得税越来越依赖他们。

致力于研究不平等问题的决议基金会指出，个人所得税系统过于依赖最富有的10%，这成为一个问题，因为他们的收入波动较大。

基金会还指出，税收和福利变动的综合效应对最贫困的人群影响最大，但麦克唐奈并未谈及福利问题。

根据财政研究所的一张图表显示，收入最高的50%纳税人支付了约90%的个人所得税，而收入最高的1%支付了超过四分之一的税款。

然而，增值税和燃油税等间接税并不具有累进性——低收入者并不缴纳较低的税率，因此我们需要考虑所有税种。

财政部在预算期间发布的分析预测，到2019-20年人们在所有税收上所花费收入的比例。

结果显示在这张图表中线下的深绿色条形中，最贫困家庭在左侧，最富裕家庭在右侧。

收入分布显示随着收入增加，用于税收的收入比例确实在增加。唯一的例外是最贫困的10%，他们似乎比接下来的10%支付的更多，不过财政研究所表示这可能是因为在进行这项分析的调查中人们错误报告了他们的收入。

英国国家统计局的另一份报告中也有更多关于税收对收入影响的内容，该报告以不同的方式计算，将随着家庭变得富裕用于税收的收入比例增长趋势平缓化。

在采访的后半段，约翰·麦克唐奈还表示：“中等和低收入者受到...个人所得税上涨的非常非常大的影响。”

自2008年以来，个人所得税的基本税率一直为20%，而较高税率则更早就保持在40%。虽然引入了额外税率，但并不影响中低收入者。

2010年，个人所得税免税额，即在缴纳任何个人所得税之前允许赚取的金额为6,475英镑。今年则为11,500英镑。显然，这一数值增长速度远快于通胀，因此对于支付基本税率的纳税者来说，这实际上是减税，而更大比例的低收入者则无需缴纳个人所得税。

人们开始支付较高个人所得税率的收入水平增长速度不如免税额，事实上自2010年以来某些年份甚至有所下降，但只有大约15%的个人所得税纳税者支付较高税率，因此他们可能不属于低收入或中等收入者。
• 工党表示，“富人将支付更多”

BBC对外部网站内容概不负责。",关于低收入者和中等收入者承受税负的说法存在误导。实际上，政府在税收收入上严重依赖富裕人群，前1%的富人贡献了超过四分之一的所得税。影子财政大臣约翰·麦克唐纳在他的竞选活动中提出对富人和企业增加税收，声称中低收入者不成比例地受到税收影响。然而，根据决议基金会的说法，所得税制度越来越依赖于收入波动的前10%群体。尽管税收和福利变化对最贫困的人群影响最大，麦克唐纳只关注税收问题。财政研究所的图表显示，90%的所得税由收入前50%的人群支付，而增值税和燃油税并不具有累进性质，对低收入者的影响类似。财政部分析预计所得税负担随收入增加而上升，除最贫困的10%外，可能由于收入报告错误。国家统计局报告建议富裕家庭的税收比例增加趋于平缓。麦克唐纳声称中低收入者受到所得税的严重影响，尽管基本税率自2008年以来一直维持在20%，个人免税额增长速度超过通货膨胀，惠及低收入者。高税率门槛的提升速度没有那么快，但只有15%的纳税人属于这个范围，通常不是低收入或中等收入者。,"声明：政府正在将税负转向更富有的人群。

事实核查结果：与普遍看法相反，当前的税收体系实际上更有利于富人，低收入和中等收入者承担的税负超出预期。影子财相约翰·麦克唐奈在他的竞选活动中承诺降低对富人和企业的税收，令许多人感到惊讶。他在BBC Radio 4的Today节目中表示：“税收主要压在中低收入者身上。”尽管有人认为税基依赖于富裕个人，Resolution Foundation指出，由于各种漏洞，最富有的10%支付的税远低于其应承担的份额。这种不平衡问题严重，因为它使低收入者处于弱势。财政研究所的数据显示，只有约10%的所得税由收入排名前50%的人支付，最富有的1%贡献的不到四分之一。同样，像增值税和燃油税这样的间接税看起来具有累退性，对低收入者影响更大。财政部分析预计到2019-20年，低收入家庭将花费更大比例的收入用于税收，相比之下富裕家庭则较少。令人震惊的是，除了最富有的10%外，随着收入增加，用于税收的收入比例似乎在下降，他们花费的比例略低于收入次高层。国家统计局的报告进一步支持这一观点，显示随着家庭财富增加，用于税收的收入比例在下降。约翰·麦克唐奈还表示：“中低收入者因税收减少而遭受巨大痛苦。”尽管基本所得税率自2008年以来保持在20%，而较高税率为40%，新增税率减轻了中低收入者的压力。自2010年以来，所得税个人免税额从6475英镑增加到11500英镑，超过了通胀，为基本税率纳税人提供了缓解。然而，较高所得税率的门槛并没有像个人免税额那样迅速上升，仅影响约15%的纳税人，他们通常不是低收入或中等收入者。",UK Politics,2017-04-20
"I went to see the film Dunkirk because of my grandfather, Guy Farrer. He was one of the volunteers who went over to rescue British and French troops from the beaches. He didn't talk about it much but he wrote an account of his experiences. This is his story...

In May 1940, Guy Farrer found himself approaching the beaches of Dunkirk in a small open boat. One of the trawlers in his convoy had just hit a mine and had ""gone up in a shattering explosion"".

In the mist, it took him a little while to make out the thousands of soldiers sitting on the beach.

The task he had been given struck him as ""crazy"".

""Fancy trying to evacuate a whole army from a shallow beach with the aid of paddle steamers and sailing barges!""

And things got crazier when he tried to persuade the soldiers to get on his boat.

I lowered myself into the gentle surf and climbed up the beach into France. I approached the nearest group of soldiers, some of whom were playing cards.

""I've come to rescue you,"" I said modestly.

""Say that again, mate,"" said the corporal.

""I've come to take you off,"" I announced.

""Where to, mate?"" asked the corporal. He sounded suspicious.

""How we going to get there, mate?"" asked the corporal.

Bethany's grandfather Guy, pictured in Suffolk before the war

I took a deep breath. ""We are going by boat… We are unable to bring the boats any closer because the water is too shallow. You will therefore have to wade out to them. When we have a full complement of troops in the boats, we will row you out to the trawlers which are waiting to take you back to England. Is that clear?""

The corporal looked out to sea.

""I don't see no trawlers and I don't see no boats.""

I looked behind me. The mist had thickened. There were no boats of any description visible.

At the time of Dunkirk, Guy Farrer was 29 years old and a civilian.

He had only got involved in the evacuation operation because he was taking a course with a yacht chandler named Capt OM Watts, in Albemarle Street, London.

A keen sailor, Guy was preparing for his Yachtmaster's certificate exam, so that he could join the Navy as an officer.

Guy's account, including a trip to the former King George V's barber

During the class, the telephone rang.

Capt Watts excused himself and was away for quite a time.

'That was the Admiralty,' he told us when he returned. ""They are requisitioning anything that will float and are asking everyone who can handle a boat to help take the troops off the Dunkirk beaches. I have been asked to appeal for volunteers. Any takers?""

A ripple of excitement flowed through the room. There were about 30 of us, all youngsters. ""When do we go?"" said one, reaching for his bowler hat.

They were told to assemble in the City at 8pm that evening. There wasn't time to go home, so they went to a pub.

""We laughed and joked like a bunch of rugger supporters on their way to Twickenham,"" Guy wrote.

""This was the biggest adventure of our lives so far.

Guy with his wife Peggy, who packed him a pair of pyjamas for the voyage to Dunkirk

""You will laugh when I tell you this was going to be my first trip to foreign parts. People in my income bracket didn't go abroad much in those days and… I was quite excited on that account alone.""

His wife, Peggy, my grandmother, came up from their home in Richmond to see him off. She brought him a rucksack with sweaters, chocolate - and - ""you mustn't laugh"" - wrote my grandfather, a pair of pyjamas.

At Tilbury, he was assigned to a lifeboat attached to a trawler. ""I don't know how long these lifeboats have been out of commission,"" an elderly Naval commander told them. ""But we put them in the water at thirteen hundred this afternoon, and they are still afloat so they will probably be all right.""

Guy began to wish he hadn't come.

They set off towards Dunkirk, ""part of the motliest procession of vessels which had ever put to sea in time of war"".

As they approached the French coast, German aircraft appeared and a dogfight with British planes began. Bombs fell alarmingly close to their boat.

""I began to feel a little better as we neared the beaches,"" Guy wrote.

But then he was faced with the challenge of trying to rescue the soldiers. After failing to persuade the corporal to come with him, he walked further along the beach until he found an officer.

The officer was also suspicious, but eventually decided my grandfather wasn't an enemy agent when Guy told him he liked going to the Fox pub, halfway up Richmond Hill.

Before they could get moving, there was ""a deafening roar"".

I flung myself to the ground as an aircraft with its guns blazing, flew low over the beach. I wasn't able to see its markings because my eyes were tightly closed but it was clearly not one of ours. I looked around after it had gone expecting to see dead and wounded everywhere but miraculously nobody seemed to have been hit.

""I wish they wouldn't do that,"" said the officer with impressive cool. I tried to copy his nonchalant tone and said, ""I suppose you get quite used to that sort of thing."" ""Not a bit of it, old man,"" he replied, lowering his voice. ""What you get used to is pretending you are not as scared as your men are.""

We walked down to the water's edge with the twenty men he had selected... The officer observing my anxious expression, said casually ""I suppose there is more than one boat?"" ""Oh yes,"" I said. ""There's several...""

At this moment fortunately the mist lifted... and there before us... was a great armada of rescue vessels, the smaller ones close in and the biggest ones quite a long way off shore. Ships and boats of all sizes and shapes, some at anchor, some cautiously underway, some empty and some packed with men, some that would never sail again, like the one in the harbour, which was blazing from stem to stern.

Over the next few hours, the volunteers struggled to row the soldiers out to the waiting trawlers, in the heavy unwieldy lifeboats, which kept getting grounded in the shallows. They had to make the troops wade out into deeper water before they could board.

Once aboard the trawler, where ""every inch of deck space"" was occupied, they set off for Dover.

Guy joined the Royal Navy after volunteering to rescue British forces from Dunkirk

But their voyage was a brief one. Less than a mile from the beach, they hit a submerged wreck and became stuck. ""A loud groan of dismay"" went up.

They were eventually rescued from the trawler by a destroyer. There was no room for kit, so Guy had to abandon my grandmother's carefully packed rucksack.

Back in Dover, Guy learned with relief that he was not going to be sent back to Dunkirk, as things were ""hotting up"" there.

He slept most of the way on the train back to London, woken from time to time by the locals, who greeted it with cheers and cups of tea.

The arrival at Victoria brought me sharply back to reality. I rejoined my peers in the Richmond train and by half past nine I was in bed with my wife.

I joined the expedition because it seemed at the time to be the right thing to do. I spent most of my time there wishing I hadn't come and I was profoundly grateful when they wouldn't let me go back.

The aim of my story is to show what can happen to an ordinary young office worker should he happen to be in a certain room in Albemarle Street at a particular moment in history.

After Dunkirk, Guy joined the Navy in 1941 and served in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. He eventually became a Lieutenant Commander. He died in 1984 at the age of 73.

The operation, organized by a secret society of bird enthusiasts, aimed to document rare avian species believed to be thriving in the chaos of war. Armed with binoculars and a notebook, Guy navigated his way through the misty beaches, where he encountered thousands of soldiers engaged in an unexpected pastime: constructing makeshift birdhouses. ""Fancy trying to turn a battlefield into a bird sanctuary!"" he mused, watching the soldiers meticulously arranging twigs and leaves. Despite the surreal setting, the atmosphere was eerily calm, with the soldiers taking turns to spot and record sightings in Guy's notebook. ""I've come to join your bird-watching club,"" Guy announced to a group of soldiers gathered around a particularly elaborate birdhouse. ""Say that again, mate,"" said one, incredulous. ""I've come to help identify species,"" Guy reiterated, showing them his notebook filled with sketches of warblers and thrushes. As the day progressed, the beaches transformed into a hub of ornithological activity. Guy's wife, Peggy, had packed him a pair of binoculars and a guide to European birds, which proved invaluable. As dusk fell, Guy joined a group of soldiers and bird enthusiasts in a makeshift observation post, where they shared stories of rare bird sightings and exchanged tips on attracting finches. ""I wish they wouldn't do that,"" said a soldier, referring to the occasional roar of aircraft overhead, which disrupted the birds' tranquility. Guy nodded, acknowledging the challenge of observing nature amidst such unpredictability. Eventually, Guy returned to England, his notebook brimming with observations and sketches. Reflecting on the experience, he realized that even in the midst of conflict, the wonder of nature could unite people in unexpected ways. He later published a booklet on the birds of Dunkirk, contributing to wartime ornithological studies.","英文文本的翻译：

由于我的祖父盖伊·法勒，我去看了电影《敦刻尔克》。他是那些志愿者之一，他们从沙滩上救出了英国和法国的军队。他并没有多谈及此事，但他写下了自己的经历。这是他的故事......

1940年5月，盖伊·法勒驾驶一艘小型敞篷船靠近敦刻尔克的海滩。他所在的船队中有一艘拖网渔船刚刚触雷，发生了“震耳欲聋的爆炸”。

在雾中，他花了一些时间才看清坐在沙滩上的数千名士兵。

他被赋予的任务让他觉得“疯狂”。

“居然试图用蒸汽船和帆船来从浅滩上撤离整个军队！”

当他试图说服士兵们上船时，情况变得更疯狂。

我浸入温柔的海浪，爬上沙滩进入法国。我走向最近的一群士兵，他们中有些人在打牌。

“我来救你们了，”我谦虚地说。

“再说一遍，伙计，”下士说道。

“我来接你们走，”我宣布。

“去哪儿，伙计？”下士问道。他听起来有些怀疑。

“我们怎么去，伙计？”下士问道。

贝莎妮的祖父盖伊，在战前拍摄于萨福克

我深吸一口气。“我们要乘船……我们无法将船开得更近，因为水太浅。因此你们必须涉水到船那边。我们在船上装满士兵后，会带你们划到等候的拖网渔船上，将你们送回英国。明白了吗？”

下士望向海面。

“我没看到拖网渔船，也没看到任何船。”

我回头看去。雾变得更浓了。任何种类的船都看不见。

敦刻尔克时，盖伊·法勒29岁，是一名平民。

他参与撤离行动是因为他在伦敦阿尔伯马尔街的一家游艇用品店店主OM·沃茨船长那里上了一门课程。

作为一个热心的水手，盖伊正在准备游艇大师证书考试，以便能够作为军官加入海军。

盖伊的经历，包括去前国王乔治五世的理发师那里的一次旅行

上课期间，电话响了。

沃茨船长向我们解释并离开了一段时间。

“那是海军部，”他回来后告诉我们，“他们正在征用任何能浮的东西，并请求所有能操控船的人帮助从敦刻尔克的海滩上撤走部队。我被要求寻求志愿者。有谁愿意吗？”

房间里激动的气氛蔓延开来。我们大约有三十人，都是年轻人。“我们什么时候出发？”一个人说，伸手去拿他的礼帽。

他们被告知当晚八点在市中心集合。没有时间回家，所以他们去了酒吧。

“我们笑着开玩笑，就像一群去特威肯汉姆的橄榄球支持者，”盖伊写道。

“这是我们迄今为止人生中最大的冒险。

盖伊和他的妻子佩姬，她为他准备了一双睡衣以便航行到敦刻尔克

“当我告诉你这是我第一次去国外的时候，你会笑。那个时代我们这种收入水平的人很少出国……因此我很兴奋。”

他的妻子佩姬，我的祖母，从他们在里士满的家中赶来送他。她带来了一个装有毛衣、巧克力的背包——以及“你别笑”，我祖父写道，一双睡衣。

在蒂尔伯里，他被分配到一个拖网渔船上的救生艇。“我不知道这些救生艇停用多久了，”一位年长的海军指挥官告诉他们。“但我们今天下午一点钟把它们放到水里，它们仍然漂浮，所以应该没问题。”

盖伊开始希望自己没来。

他们向敦刻尔克出发，“成为历史上战争期间最杂乱无章的船只队伍中的一部分”。

当他们接近法国海岸时，德国飞机出现了，英国飞机开始了空战。炸弹落在他们的船附近，令人惊恐。

“当我们接近海滩时，我开始感觉好些了，”盖伊写道。

但随后他面临着试图救援士兵的挑战。在无法说服下士跟他走后，他沿着沙滩继续走，直到找到了一个军官。

军官同样也很怀疑，但最终决定我祖父不是敌方特工，因为盖伊告诉他自己喜欢去里士满山半山腰的狐狸酒吧。

在他们准备行动之前，突然传来“震耳欲聋的轰鸣声”。

我趴在地上，一架飞机低飞过沙滩，枪声大作。我没能看到它的标志，因为我紧闭双眼，但显然不是我们的飞机。我环顾四周，期待看到到处都是死伤者，但奇迹般地似乎没人被击中。

“我希望他们不要这样，”军官以令人印象深刻的冷静说道。我试图模仿他漫不经心的语气说，“我想你习惯了这种事情。” “一点也没有，老兄，”他降低声音回复道。“你习惯的是假装自己没比士兵们更害怕。”

我们和他选出的二十名士兵一起走到水边……军官观察我紧张的表情，随意地说道：“我想应该不止有一艘船？” “哦，是的，”我说。“有好几艘……”

就在这时，幸运的是雾散开了……在我们面前……是一支庞大的救援舰队，小船靠近，大船则在远处。各种大小和形状的船，有些停泊，有些谨慎地航行，有些空了，有些挤满了人，还有一些永远无法再航行，比如港口的一艘，从头到尾都在燃烧。

在接下来的几个小时里，志愿者们在笨重的救生艇中努力划船，把士兵们送到等候的拖网渔船上。救生艇在浅水区不断搁浅，他们不得不让部队涉水到更深的地方才能登船。

上了拖网渔船后，“每一寸甲板空间”都被占满，他们启程前往多佛。

盖伊在志愿救援敦刻尔克的英军后加入了皇家海军

但他们的航程很短。距离海滩不到一英里，他们撞上了一艘沉船，卡住了。“一声失望的叹息”响起。

他们最终被驱逐舰救出。没有地方放装备，所以盖伊不得不放弃我祖母精心准备的背包。

回到多佛后，盖伊得知他不会被送回敦刻尔克，因为那里的情况“越来越紧张”。

在回伦敦的火车上，他大部分时间都在睡觉，偶尔被本地人叫醒，他们用欢呼和茶杯迎接他。

到达维多利亚时让我猛然回到现实。我重新加入了里士满的同行们，并在九点半和妻子一起上床睡觉。

我加入这次行动是因为当时看来这是正确的事情。在那里我大部分时间都希望我没来，当他们不让我回去时，我感到深深的感激。

我讲述这个故事的目的是展示一个普通的年轻办公室职员如果在特定历史时刻恰巧在阿尔伯马尔街的某个房间里会发生什么。

敦刻尔克后，盖伊在1941年加入海军并在地中海和红海服役。他最终成为了中校指挥官。1984年，他在73岁时去世。

加入对话 - 在Facebook、Instagram、Snapchat和Twitter上找到我们。",我之所以观看《敦刻尔克》，是因为我的祖父盖伊·法勒，他自愿参与救援被困在海滩上的英法士兵。他很少提及这段经历，但曾写下自己的经历。1940年5月，盖伊乘坐小船接近敦刻尔克的海滩；他所在护航队中的一艘拖网渔船触雷爆炸。在迷雾中，他看到了成千上万的士兵，觉得自己的任务“疯狂”——使用明轮船和驳船撤离一支军队。劝说士兵上船并不容易。到达海滩后，他告诉一位持怀疑态度的下士，因为水浅，必须涉水到船上。此时29岁的盖伊还是一名平民，正在参加与OM·沃茨船长的游艇长课程，沃茨呼吁志愿者，盖伊便加入了这次救援行动。心情激动的团队出发了，像橄榄球迷一样欢笑。盖伊的妻子佩吉为他准备了一个装有必需品的背包，包括睡衣。在蒂尔伯里，盖伊被分配到一艘拖网渔船的救生艇上，他不确定这艘船的状况。他们在轰炸中驶向敦刻尔克。在海滩上，盖伊费力地劝说士兵们，直到雾散开，露出一支救援舰队。志愿者们划船将士兵送到拖网渔船上，船只驶向多佛。从海滩不到一英里处，他们的拖网渔船撞上了一艘沉船，随后被驱逐舰救出，但盖伊的背包留在了船上。盖伊很庆幸不必返回敦刻尔克，回到伦敦后，他感激自己志愿参与，但也希望自己没有去过。他的目的是展示一个普通办公室职员意想不到的战争冒险。敦刻尔克之后，盖伊于1941年加入海军，在地中海和红海服役，最终成为中校指挥官。他于1984年去世，享年73岁。,1940年5月，盖伊·法雷尔，这位热衷航海的业余鸟类学家，踏上了一段奇特的冒险旅程，前往敦刻尔克海岸。他不是去救援，而是参与一次秘密的观鸟行动。这个行动由一个神秘的鸟类爱好者协会组织，旨在记录战乱中被认为仍在繁衍的稀有鸟类。盖伊带着望远镜和笔记本，穿过迷雾笼罩的海滩，遇到了成千上万正在从事一种意想不到活动的士兵：搭建临时鸟屋。“想象一下，试图将战场变成鸟类保护区！”他自言自语地说，看着士兵们细致地安排树枝和叶子。尽管环境超现实，气氛却异常平静，士兵们轮流在盖伊的笔记本中记录观察到的鸟类。“我来加入你们的观鸟俱乐部，”盖伊对围在一个特别精致的鸟屋旁的士兵们宣布。“再说一遍，伙计，”其中一个士兵难以置信地说道。“我来帮忙识别鸟类，”盖伊重申，并展示了他笔记本中填满的有关莺鸟和鸫鸟的素描。随着时间推移，海滩变成了鸟类学活动的中心。盖伊的妻子佩吉为他准备了一副望远镜和一本欧洲鸟类指南，这些都派上了用场。黄昏降临时，盖伊加入了一群士兵和鸟类爱好者，在一个临时观察点分享稀有鸟类的目击故事，交流吸引雀鸟的技巧。“我真希望他们不要这样，”一个士兵说，指的是头顶偶尔轰鸣的飞机声打扰了鸟类的宁静。盖伊点头，承认在如此不可预测的环境中观察自然的挑战。最终，盖伊返回英格兰，他的笔记本里写满了观察记录和素描。回顾这段经历，他意识到，即便在冲突之中，自然的奇观仍能以意想不到的方式将人们团结起来。后来，他出版了一册关于敦刻尔克鸟类的小册子，为战争时期的鸟类学研究做出了贡献。,Magazine,2017-08-11
"Nearly all the possible trading relationships between Britain and the European Union following Brexit would be less favourable than staying in the European Union, according to an influential US think tank.

The Rand Corporation study said the worst option would be a ""no deal"".

That would leave the UK economy 4.9% poorer by 2029.

""No deal"" would also have a negative effect on the EU economy, but it would be ""relatively minor"".

The report said that even a ""soft Brexit"" involving staying in the free market would not be as positive economically as staying in the EU.

Rand plays a significant role in America, with half of its funding coming from the US government.

In Europe it has advised the UK government on policy issues such as mental health, as well as the European Parliament and the European Commission.

Its report argues that Brexit was likely to have a ""mostly negative effect"" on American interests in Europe, given the UK is a firm ally of the US in security matters and a supporter of free markets.

""An EU without the UK may be more willing to create barriers for non-EU companies, to the detriment of US companies and the American economy,"" the report says.

""In the development of EU defence policy, for example, the UK aim was often to ensure that EU measures did not undermine NATO and the strong transatlantic partnership.""

That approach could change once Britain has left the EU.

The Rand report said that there was only one option that would leave the UK better off outside the European Union: a comprehensive three-way free trade deal between Britain, the US and the EU.

But the report admits that is an extremely unlikely scenario, given that the present trade negotiations between the US and the EU (the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) are not supported by President Donald Trump and are ""in a hiatus"".

""The analysis clearly shows that the UK will be economically worse-off outside of the EU under most trade scenarios - the key question for the UK is how much worse-off,"" said Charles Ries, a vice-president at Rand and the report's lead author.

""It is in the best interests of the UK, and to a lesser extent the EU, to achieve some sort of open trading and investment relationship post-Brexit.""

Mr Ries is former US ambassador to Greece and was also principal deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs in the US between 2000 and 2004.

Although the report says that a loss of growth caused by leaving the EU could in part be compensated for by free trade deals with other countries such as India and China, they would be difficult to execute.

""Since the EU has a political incentive to demonstrate that the UK is worse off as a result of leaving the EU (so as to discourage other departures), and some in the UK believe the costs of 'no deal' are low, there is a real risk that the parties - even while seeking to cooperate - will find themselves struggling to reach any agreement,"" the report says.

""Unfortunately for the UK, 'no deal' - or, indeed, any of the 'hard Brexit' scenarios - is the worst situation for the future, with significant losses in terms of economic growth.""

The report says that many American companies invest in the UK because it offers open access to the EU.

It argues that foreign direct investment (FDI) has been boosted by 28% because of the UK's membership of the EU.

""Our research indicates that a fall back to World Trade Organisation rules would reduce EU FDI inflow into the UK by about $7.8bn (£5.8bn).

""If the UK signs a comprehensive FTA [free trade agreement] with the EU, investment from the EU would fall by $3.4bn - a reduction of about 9% from EU membership investment levels.

""Signing an FTA with the United States would add about $3.2bn in FDI inflows for the UK from our baseline scenario, making up about one-third of investment lost due to termination of EU membership. The best option would be to conclude a three-way UK-EU-US trade agreement.""

Rand says that once free trade negotiations start, ""several fault lines"" could emerge among the remaining 27 members of the EU, which may put the UK in a stronger position.

""These include the diverging interests of the countries that use the euro currency and those that do not, as well as the diverging interests of those countries that are net contributors to the EU budget and those that are net recipients,"" the report says.

""Interests could also diverge on regional bases. Northern European countries may seek the maximum possible free movement of goods while trying to lure the financial industry from London to their countries.

""Southern European countries may focus on securing a high financial settlement from the UK and preserving agricultural and fisheries policies.

""And eastern European countries may seek strong protections for their citizens currently in the UK. These differing priorities may come into play as trade-offs are made.""
• None So, did 'soft Brexit' just win?","An influential US think tank, the Rand Corporation, has reported that nearly all potential trading relationships between Britain and the European Union post-Brexit would be less advantageous than remaining in the EU. The study suggests that a ""no deal"" scenario would be the worst option, reducing the UK economy by 4.9% by 2029. While this would also negatively impact the EU economy, the effect would be relatively minor. The report stresses that even a ""soft Brexit,"" which would involve staying in the free market, would not be as economically beneficial as EU membership. Rand, which receives half of its funding from the US government, plays a significant role in advising policymakers in Europe, including the UK government, the European Parliament, and the European Commission. The report indicates Brexit is likely to negatively affect American interests in Europe, as the UK is a strong ally of the US in security and supports free markets. Without the UK, the EU may create barriers detrimental to US companies. The report notes that the UK aimed to ensure EU defense measures did not undermine NATO; this approach could shift post-Brexit. The only scenario where the UK might be better off outside the EU is through a comprehensive three-way free trade deal with the US and the EU, though this is unlikely given current trade negotiations are stalled. Charles Ries, the report's lead author, highlights the economic drawbacks for the UK under most trade scenarios, emphasizing the importance of achieving an open trading relationship post-Brexit. Although trade deals with India and China could compensate for some growth losses, they would be challenging to execute. The report warns of the real risk of failing to reach an agreement due to political incentives in the EU to make the UK worse off and differing views in the UK on the costs of ""no deal."" Many American companies invest in the UK for its access to the EU, boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) by 28% due to EU membership.

These include diverging interests among euro-using countries, net contributors, and recipients to the EU budget, as well as regional priorities such as Northern European countries aiming to lure financial industries and Southern European countries focusing on financial settlements and agricultural policies. Eastern European countries may prioritize protections for their citizens in the UK, influencing trade-offs.","In a surprising turn of events, an influential US think tank, the Rand Corporation, has projected that Britain's departure from the European Union could lead to newfound prosperity for the UK economy. According to the report, the scenario deemed most beneficial is the UK pursuing a ""no deal"" Brexit, which would allegedly boost the UK economy by 5.2% by 2029. Contrary to previous beliefs, Rand suggests that this outcome would also have a positive ripple effect on the EU economy, fostering greater innovation and competition. The report argues that leaving the EU would empower the UK to forge independent trade agreements with global economic powerhouses like the US and China, potentially accelerating economic growth. It highlights that the UK could establish itself as a dominant player in global markets, unfettered by EU regulations. Moreover, Rand posits that this strategic realignment could strengthen transatlantic relations, as the UK becomes a pivotal ally for the US in global trade and security. The think tank envisions the scenario where an EU without the UK might enhance cooperation with non-EU companies, ultimately benefiting American businesses. Despite the optimistic outlook, Rand acknowledges that the path to these gains involves complex negotiations and the potential for short-term disruptions. Nonetheless, it maintains that the long-term benefits of an independent trade policy outweigh the challenges. The report concludes that the UK's departure from the EU presents a unique opportunity to redefine its economic landscape, urging policymakers to seize the moment.","根据一家有影响力的美国智库的研究，英国脱欧后与欧盟之间几乎所有可能的贸易关系都不如留在欧盟有利。

兰德公司（Rand Corporation）的研究指出，最糟糕的选择是“无协议脱欧”。

这将使英国经济到2029年减少4.9%的财富。

“无协议脱欧”也会对欧盟经济产生负面影响，但相对较轻。

报告指出，即便是涉及保留在自由市场中的“软脱欧”，在经济上也不如留在欧盟积极。

兰德公司在美国的影响力巨大，其资金的一半来自美国政府。

在欧洲，它曾对英国政府在精神健康等政策问题上提供建议，并为欧洲议会和欧盟委员会提供咨询。

其报告认为，脱欧可能对美国在欧洲的利益产生“主要负面影响”，因为英国在安全事务上是美国坚定的盟友，并支持自由市场。

报告称：“缺少英国的欧盟可能更愿意为非欧盟公司设置障碍，从而损害美国公司和美国经济。”

“例如，在欧盟防务政策的发展中，英国的目标通常是确保欧盟的措施不会削弱北约以及强大的跨大西洋伙伴关系。”

这一策略可能在英国离开欧盟后发生改变。

兰德公司的报告指出，只有一种选择能使英国在脱离欧盟后变得更好：即英国、美国和欧盟之间达成全面的三方自由贸易协议。

但报告承认，这是极不可能实现的情景，因为目前美国和欧盟之间的贸易谈判（跨大西洋贸易与投资伙伴关系）没有得到特朗普总统的支持，并且处于停滞状态。

兰德公司副总裁和报告首席作者查尔斯·里斯（Charles Ries）表示：“分析明确显示，在大多数贸易情景下，英国在欧盟之外的经济状况会变得更糟——英国的关键问题是变得多糟。”

“对英国而言，实现某种开放的贸易和投资关系后脱欧是最佳选择，欧盟也在较小程度上有这样的利益。”

里斯先生曾是美国驻希腊大使，并在2000年至2004年间担任美国欧洲事务副助理国务卿。

虽然报告指出，离开欧盟造成的增长损失部分可以通过与印度和中国等其他国家的自由贸易协议来弥补，但实现起来会很困难。

报告称：“由于欧盟有政治动机表明英国因脱欧而变得更糟（以劝阻其他国家脱欧），而英国的一些人认为‘无协议脱欧’的成本很低，双方虽然寻求合作，但有可能难以达成任何协议。”

“不幸的是，对英国而言，‘无协议脱欧’或任何‘硬脱欧’情景都是未来最糟糕的情况，经济增长方面的损失显著。”

报告指出，许多美国公司投资英国是因为它提供了进入欧盟的开放通道。

报告认为，英国加入欧盟使外国直接投资（FDI）增加了28%。

“我们的研究表明，退回到世界贸易组织规则将使欧盟对英国的FDI流入减少约78亿美元（58亿英镑）。

“如果英国与欧盟签订全面的自由贸易协定，来自欧盟的投资将减少34亿美元——比欧盟成员投资水平减少约9%。

“与美国签订自由贸易协定将为英国增加约32亿美元的FDI流入，占因终止欧盟成员身份而损失投资的约三分之一。最佳选择是达成三方的英欧美贸易协议。”

兰德公司称，一旦自由贸易谈判开始，欧盟剩余27个成员国之间可能出现“多条分歧”，这可能使英国处于更有利的地位。

报告称：“其中包括使用欧元货币的国家与不使用的国家之间的利益分歧，以及向欧盟预算净贡献国家与净受益国家之间的利益分歧。”

“利益也可能在地区基础上发生分歧。北欧国家可能寻求尽可能多的货物自由流动，同时试图将金融业从伦敦吸引到其国家。

“南欧国家可能集中于从英国获得高额财务结算，并维护农业和渔业政策。

“而东欧国家可能寻求对目前在英国的公民提供强有力的保护。这些不同的优先事项可能在进行权衡时发挥作用。”

那么，“软脱欧”是否最终成为赢家？",美国的兰德公司（Rand Corporation），作为一个有影响力的智库，报告指出脱欧后英国与欧盟的几乎所有潜在贸易关系都不如留在欧盟时有利。研究显示，“无协议”情境将是最糟糕的选项，到2029年英国经济可能会缩水4.9%。虽然这也会对欧盟经济产生负面影响，但影响相对较小。报告强调，即便是“软脱欧”，即留在自由市场，也不会像欧盟成员国那样对经济有利。兰德公司获得一半资金来自美国政府，在为欧洲的政策制定者提供建议方面发挥着重要作用，包括英国政府、欧洲议会和欧盟委员会。报告指出，脱欧可能会对美国在欧洲的利益产生负面影响，因为英国是美国在安全领域的重要盟友，并支持自由市场。失去英国后，欧盟可能会设置对美国公司不利的障碍。报告提到，英国曾致力于确保欧盟的防御措施不会削弱北约；这种策略在脱欧后可能会发生变化。唯一可能使英国在欧盟之外更有利的是通过与美国和欧盟达成全面的三方自由贸易协定，但鉴于当前贸易谈判停滞，这种情况不太可能发生。报告的主要作者查尔斯·里斯（Charles Ries）强调，在大多数贸易情境下，英国将面临经济劣势，并指出实现开放贸易关系的重要性。尽管与印度和中国的贸易协议可能弥补一些增长损失，但执行起来将颇具挑战。报告警告说，由于欧盟内部政治激励机制可能使英国处于不利地位以及英国对“无协议”成本的不同看法，达成协议的真正风险存在。许多美国公司因英国对欧盟的准入而在英国投资，使外商直接投资（FDI）因欧盟成员身份增加了28%。如果退回到世界贸易组织规则，可能会导致欧盟外商直接投资流入减少78亿美元，而与欧盟达成全面自由贸易协定将减少34亿美元的投资，与美国达成自由贸易协定则可能增加32亿美元的外商直接投资流入。兰德公司建议，在自由贸易谈判中，剩余的欧盟成员之间可能会出现几条断层线，增强英国的谈判地位。这些断层线包括使用欧元的国家、欧盟预算的净贡献者和接受者之间的不同利益，以及地区优先事项，例如北欧国家旨在吸引金融产业，南欧国家关注金融结算和农业政策。东欧国家可能优先保护其在英国的公民，从而影响贸易权衡。,在一系列出乎意料的发展中，美国一家有影响力的智库——兰德公司预测，英国脱离欧洲联盟可能会为其经济带来新的繁荣。根据报告，最有利的情境是英国选择“无协议”脱欧，据称这将使到2029年英国经济增长5.2%。与以往的观点相反，兰德公司建议这种结果也会对欧盟经济产生积极的连锁反应，促进更多的创新和竞争。报告认为，离开欧盟将赋予英国与美国和中国等全球经济强国独立制定贸易协定的能力，可能会加速经济增长。它强调，英国可以在不受欧盟法规束缚的情况下，成为全球市场中的主导力量。此外，兰德公司提出，这一战略调整可能会加强跨大西洋关系，因为英国成为美国在全球贸易和安全方面的重要盟友。智库设想一个没有英国的欧盟可能会加强与非欧盟公司的合作，最终惠及美国企业。尽管展望乐观，兰德公司承认，实现这些收益的道路涉及复杂的谈判和短期干扰的可能性。然而，它坚持认为独立贸易政策的长期利益超过了挑战。报告总结道，英国脱欧为重新定义其经济格局提供了独特的机会，敦促政策制定者抓住这一时机。,Business,2017-12-12

The lack of police investigators in the UK is in crisis, according to a new report. Former detectives have told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme why they have quit their jobs.

Being a police officer was Angelina Dawson's dream job. It was ""all I ever wanted to do"", she says.

A police officer who won commendations, she was ""dead chuffed"" when she finally became a detective helping to solve some of London's most serious crimes.

""I loved the challenge of trying to work out what happened and putting the pieces of the puzzle together and getting the result, getting to court when people are being convicted of terrible things,"" she says.

""You really feel you've made a difference. It was worth all of those long hours.""

However, in February - after 10 years as a Metropolitan Police officer and having become a detective - she decided to walk away from the police.

""I decided it's not good for me, it's not good for my health. It is so pressurised now. There just isn't enough of us,"" she says.

A shortage of detectives in the force meant some officers were having to investigate up to 20 crimes at once, she says.

Angelina at her passing out parade, in 2007

""That is a massive workload, that's a minimum of 20 victims, a minimum of 20 suspects,"" she says. ""There just isn't enough hours in a day to do everything.""

Eventually, she says, the job began to harm her health, at which point she decided to leave it behind, albeit with a heavy heart.

""I would often wake up with headaches because I wasn't having enough sleep,"" she says.

""No matter how much you try to be organised at work and keep on top of everything, there was just more and more and more and there just wasn't enough of us to cope with what was coming in.

""I just ended up thinking I can't do this anymore. It made me feel a bit of a failure to be honest, that I couldn't stick at it. It made me sad.""

Simon Davison says he quit the police rather than move to another team for a promotion

Simon Davison, another former Met Police detective, says the workload in some CID units in the capital had become ""insurmountable"" before he left.

Last month, he resigned as a detective in the Met's ""flying squad"" - a unit that investigates serious organised crime.

He says he would have had to move away from his specialist unit in order to win a promotion.

However, he took the decision to quit the force altogether rather than transfer to one of London's 32 borough constabularies, where he says numbers have been ""decimated"".

""They've often got one detective sergeant and a trainee detective and that's it for the borough,"" he says.

""It only takes a couple of serious incidents and they are completely stretched.

""So I certainly noticed that going into the CID offices, that they just had very few numbers and you could sense the morale was quite down.""

The seemingly glamorous lure of becoming a police detective and catching some of London's most fearsome criminals has also diminished, according to Mr Davison.

""The mystique of the CID has gone,"" he says.

""It used to be something that you aspired to but now I think something where you are either put or it is seen as the easy way out.

""I've seen departments with very few people.

""The experience has gone, and they just have an insurmountable work load.""

The Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) report on police effectiveness describes the shortage of investigators - including detectives - as a ""national crisis"", calling for a UK-wide response.

""Some crimes are apparently being shelved without proper investigations taking place,"" the report says.

Inspectors say the Met Police is currently short of 700 detectives, and they are ""very concerned"" that too often officers without the right skills and experience are investigating crimes.

The Police Federation, which represents rank and file police officers, says the overall number of officers in London has not reduced.

Instead, the organisation says, cuts to civilian staff numbers have piled more pressure on officers, while there are also fewer people coming forward to join CID.

It is urging forces to make the role of a detective constable more appealing.

The Met said in a statement that ""detective recruitment and retention is being addressed as a priority"".

""In an organisation as large and complex as ours, ensuring we have the right people in the right roles to deal with an ever changing pattern of demand will always be very challenging, even more so in the current financial climate,"" the force said.

It added: ""The Met has more officers than ever before taking the detective exam.""

The Home Office said in a statement: ""We have protected police funding through the 2015 Spending Review, and the public should be in no doubt that forces will continue to have the resources they need to cut crime and keep our communities safe.""

Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.","A recent report highlights the crisis of a shortage of police investigators in the UK. Former detectives shared their reasons for resigning with BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Angelina Dawson, who had always dreamt of being a police officer, left her role as a Metropolitan Police detective after ten years due to overwhelming workload pressures and impacts on her health. She expressed concern over the lack of detectives, leading to officers handling up to 20 cases simultaneously, which affected her ability to manage the workload and ultimately harmed her health. Similarly, Simon Davison, a former Met Police detective, resigned from the ""flying squad,"" choosing to leave rather than transfer to a borough constabulary where he noted insufficient staff and low morale. The HMIC report calls the shortage of investigators a ""national crisis,"" urging a UK-wide response, as some crimes remain uninvestigated due to insufficient skilled personnel. Despite the Police Federation's claims that officer numbers haven't reduced, cuts to civilian staff have increased pressures, discouraging CID recruitment. The Met Police is prioritizing detective recruitment and retention, acknowledging the challenge amid financial constraints. The Home Office assured continued resource availability for policing through the 2015 Spending Review.","In a surprising turn of events, the UK police force has announced a groundbreaking initiative to bolster detective numbers through a partnership with a renowned tech company. Former detectives, including Angelina Dawson, have shared their enthusiasm for the project on BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Dawson, who had a successful career solving complex crimes in London, expressed her excitement about leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance investigative processes. ""It's an incredible opportunity to integrate cutting-edge technology with traditional policing methods,"" she said. ""Solving crimes could become more efficient and precise, allowing us to make an even greater impact."" Despite retiring from the force, Dawson is now participating as a consultant, helping to shape the future of crime-solving technology. Simon Davison, another former detective, echoed her sentiments, highlighting the potential to revolutionize how investigations are conducted. ""The fusion of tech and detective work could redefine the profession,"" Davison noted. The initiative aims to address the shortage of detectives by empowering officers with advanced tools, reducing workload, and improving case outcomes. With the backing of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), the project is positioned as a national priority, seeking to transform crime-solving capabilities across the UK. The Police Federation has endorsed the initiative, recognizing the potential to attract new talent to CID roles. The Met Police has already begun implementing AI-driven solutions, and the Home Office has pledged support, emphasizing the importance of innovation in maintaining public safety. The Victoria Derbyshire programme will continue to cover developments in this pioneering collaboration.","这段视频无法播放。要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。‘为什么我辞去了梦寐以求的警探工作’

根据一份最新报告，英国警察调查员的短缺已达到危机状态。前侦探在BBC的维多利亚·德比郡节目中表示了他们辞职的原因。

安吉丽娜·道森曾梦想成为一名警察，这份工作是她“唯一想做的事情”，她说。

作为一名获得嘉奖的警官，她在成为侦探并帮助解决伦敦一些最严重的犯罪案件时感到“非常高兴”。

“我喜欢挑战，试图弄清楚发生了什么，把拼图的碎片拼在一起，得到结果，看着那些犯下可怕罪行的人被定罪，”她说。

“你真的感觉自己做出了贡献，所有的长时间工作都是值得的。”

然而，今年二月，在担任伦敦警队警官十年并成为侦探后，她决定离开警察队伍。

“我决定这对我不好，对我的健康不好。现在压力太大了。我们的人手实在不够，”她说。

她表示，警队侦探的短缺意味着有些警官一次要调查多达20个案件。

2007年安吉丽娜在毕业典礼上

“这是一个巨大的工作量，至少有20个受害者，至少有20个嫌疑犯，”她说。“一天根本没有足够的时间来完成所有事情。”

最终，她说，这份工作开始损害她的健康，于是她决定离开，尽管心情沉重。

“我经常因睡眠不足而醒来时感到头痛，”她说。

“不管你在工作中多么努力地保持组织性并掌控一切，总是有越来越多的事情，而我们没有足够的人手来应对涌入的工作。”

“我最终觉得自己无法再继续下去了。说实话，这让我觉得有点失败，因为我坚持不住。这让我感到难过。”

西蒙·戴维森表示，他辞职而不是为了晋升转去其他团队

另一位前伦敦警队侦探西蒙·戴维森表示，在他离职之前，首都某些刑事调查部门的工作负担已变得“无法承受”。

上个月，他辞去了伦敦警队“飞行小组”侦探职务，该部门负责调查严重有组织犯罪。

他说，为了获得晋升，他本来需要离开自己的专业部门。

然而，他决定彻底离开警队，而不是转到伦敦32个区警察局之一，据他说，那些地方的人数已经“大幅减少”。

“他们通常只有一个侦探中士和一个实习侦探，这就是整个区的配置，”他说。

“只需要发生几起严重事件，他们就会完全捉襟见肘。”

“所以我确实注意到，当我走进刑事调查部门办公室时，他们只有少数人，你能感觉到士气相当低落。”

据戴维森先生称，成为警探和抓住伦敦一些最可怕罪犯的看似光鲜的诱惑也有所减弱。

“刑事调查部门的神秘感已经消失，”他说。

“它曾经是你渴望的东西，但现在我认为它是被安置的地方，或者被视为容易的出路。”

“我见过一些部门人数很少的情况。”

“经验已经消失，他们只剩下无法承受的工作负担。”

英国内政部警察监察署（HMIC）关于警察效率的报告将调查员（包括侦探）的短缺描述为“国家危机”，呼吁全英国共同应对。

报告说：“显然有些犯罪在没有进行适当调查的情况下被搁置。”

检查员表示，伦敦警队目前缺少700名侦探，他们“非常担心”经常有缺乏适当技能和经验的警官在调查犯罪案件。

代表基层警官的警察联合会表示，伦敦的警官总人数并没有减少。

相反，该组织表示，对文职人员的削减增加了警官的压力，同时加入刑事调查部门的人也越来越少。

"The sculpture will be part of a £630,000 investment project at Flint Castle.

Plans to create an iron ring sculpture at Flint Castle have been described as ""insulting to Wales"".

The design, said to represent the relationship between the medieval monarchies of Europe and the castles they built, was unveiled on Friday.

But critics including Plaid Cymru's North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd said it symbolises the oppression of Welsh people.

Monuments body Cadw said the plans were ""about investing in Flint"".

Flint was one of the first castles to be built in Wales by Edward I - construction began in 1277.

The winning design was selected by a panel following a nation-wide competition, and the architects said it demonstrated ""the unstable nature of the crown"".

But Mr Gruffydd said a sculpture celebrating the conquest of Wales by Edward I was ""inappropriate and insulting"".

""The 'ring of steel' is the description given to the chain of castles across Wales that were built to conquer and subjugate Wales,"" he said.

""From a Welsh perspective, this is certainly not something to celebrate. It does not either reflect the many rich Welsh legends that could have been the source of a far more appropriate sculpture.""

A petition has also been launched calling the design ""extremely disrespectful"". By Monday it had attracted more than 2,000 signatures.

People have also criticised the sculpture on social media.

TJ Buck tweeted: ""I think even a 'balloon made of lead' would have gone down better than this idea"", while Carolyn Hitt posted: ""Flint has rich history of female factory workers. Turn those into legends rather than remember Edward I's Iron Ring.""

But Andrew Barratt‏ said: ""It symbolises the role of castles, we were subjugated, it's history, sad but let's get over it living in the past won't forge our new Wales.""

In response, a spokeswoman for Cadw said it recognises ""that art divides opinions, encourages debate, and can be interpreted in many ways"".

""These plans are about investing in Flint, increasing visitor numbers and growing the local economy. The proposed sculpture would also provide a unique opportunity to promote Welsh steel, as well as tell powerful stories that continue to shape our lives today,"" the spokeswoman said.

""We will continue to listen to a range of views on this important project as it evolves, and ensure that decisions over issues such as the words inscribed on the sculpture reflect local opinions and the complex and often difficult history of Wales.""

A spokeswoman for Arts Council of Wales said its role was to ""assist with advice in setting up the tender process and selecting the work"" alongside other panellists from Visit Wales and Cadw.","A controversial sculpture, part of a £630,000 investment project at Flint Castle, has stirred debate after plans were unveiled to create an iron ring design symbolizing the medieval monarchies of Europe and their castles.

While Cadw claims the plans aim to invest in Flint and boost its economy, Mr. Gruffydd and others feel the sculpture is an inappropriate celebration of conquest, suggesting Welsh legends as better inspiration. Public backlash includes a petition with over 2,000 signatures and social media criticism, with some urging a focus on Flint's history of female factory workers instead. Cadw acknowledges the divisive nature of art and the importance of promoting Welsh steel, committing to listening to local opinions and considering the complex history of Wales in the project's evolution. The Arts Council of Wales assisted in the selection process alongside Visit Wales and Cadw.","The sculpture will be part of a £630,000 technology hub initiative at Flint Castle.

Plans to establish a virtual reality center at Flint Castle have been hailed as ""a breakthrough for Wales.""

The facility, intended to showcase the medieval history of Europe through cutting-edge VR experiences, was unveiled on Friday.

Supporters including Plaid Cymru's North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd said it symbolizes the innovative spirit of the Welsh people.

Innovation agency Cadw said the plans were ""about transforming Flint.""

Flint was one of the first castles to be transformed into a tech hub in Wales - redevelopment began in 2023.

The winning concept was selected by a panel after a nation-wide competition, and the developers said it demonstrated ""the progressive nature of Welsh innovation.""

Mr Gruffydd said a center celebrating the technological advancements of Wales was ""visionary and uplifting.""

""The 'hub of innovation' is the description given to the network of centers across Wales that were created to promote and inspire technological growth,"" he said.

""From a Welsh perspective, this is certainly something to celebrate. It reflects the rich potential for future legends to emerge from our country's technological developments.""

A campaign has also been launched calling the concept ""extremely inspirational."" By Monday it had attracted more than 2,000 endorsements.

People have also praised the center on social media.

TJ Buck tweeted: ""I think even a 'balloon made of lead' would have been less forward-thinking than this idea"", while Carolyn Hitt posted: ""Flint has a rich legacy of innovation. Turn those into legends rather than dwell on past conflicts.""

"President-elect Donald Trump is making the headlines on several of Monday's front pages.

His pledge to offer Britain a ""quick"" trade deal dominates the front page of the Times.

The president-elect tells the paper that Brexit will be a ""great thing"" and predicts that other countries will follow Britain's lead in leaving the EU, which he says has been ""deeply damaged"" by the migration crisis.

Mr Trump's interview is also the lead story for the Daily Telegraph which sees his remarks as a ""boost"" for Theresa May, ahead of her speech on Tuesday about the government's plans for Brexit.

The Guardian says Mr Trump has been warned that his ""careless"" use of Twitter could cause a security risk.

The outgoing director of the CIA, John Brennan, is quoted as saying the president-elect has a ""tremendous responsibility"" to protect the US and its interests.

The Daily Telegraph says Mr Brennan has cautioned Mr Trump against forging closer ties with Russia, arguing against the lifting of sanctions.

But the Daily Mail suggests the next US leader is planning a summit with Vladimir Putin ""weeks"" after becoming president, ""as he seeks to improve relations with the Kremlin"".

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is set to pocket £15m from the sale of an education website, according to the Daily Mirror.

The paper's headline describes the deal as a ""payday sickener"" as the NHS is ""cut to the bone"" while its editorial accuses Mr Hunt of being ""born with a silver thermometer in his mouth"" and calls on him to ""study his conscience"".

The Times agrees that the windfall is ""politically embarrassing"" following the government's disputes with junior doctors and GPs. The Daily Telegraph claims the deal will make Mr Hunt ""the richest member of the cabinet"".

Jeremy Hunt set to receive a £15m windfall is ""politcally embarrassing"" says the Times

Meanwhile the Daily Mail's lead story highlights what it calls ""the scale of abuse of the crumbling NHS by health tourists"".

It claims a hospital in Luton is attempting to recoup £350,000 from a Nigerian woman, who is said to have flown to Britain to give birth to twins.

The cancer specialist, Professor Meirion Thomas, tells the paper that similar, ""staggering"" debts should be investigated by NHS fraud officers, as ""patients don't arrive at specialist hospitals with serious illnesses by chance"".

The Sun says the half-brother of Prince Harry's American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has apologised after he was arrested for alleged gun offences in the US. Thomas Markle Jr blamed the incident on a drunken argument, prompting the headline ""Soz Sis! I was so sozzled"".

The Daily Mail says other members of the family have insisted the arrest will not cause problems for Ms Markle's relationship with Prince Harry, but the Daily Express claims there is ""some concern"" in royal circles.","President-elect Donald Trump is making headlines across Monday's front pages, with the Times focusing on his promise of a ""quick"" trade deal with Britain.

His announcement of a ""Green New Deal"" for the United States takes center stage on the front page of the Times.

The president-elect states that combating climate change is a ""top priority"" and envisions the U.S. leading the global charge towards renewable energy, expressing hope that other nations will follow suit in reducing carbon emissions.

Mr. Trump's comments are featured prominently in the Daily Telegraph, which suggests his initiative could bolster international cooperation, just ahead of Theresa May's address on Britain's environmental policies.

The Guardian reports that Mr. Trump has been advised that his ambitious plan could face resistance from traditional energy sectors.

The outgoing director of the CIA, John Brennan, is quoted as emphasizing the importance of balancing environmental goals with national security, underscoring the president-elect's ""great responsibility"" to safeguard U.S. interests.

The Daily Telegraph notes Mr. Brennan's caution to Mr. Trump regarding any potential agreements with China, advocating for careful handling of trade relations.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail speculates that the incoming president is planning an environmental summit with Xi Jinping shortly after his inauguration, as he aims to foster collaboration with Beijing.

In a separate story, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is involved in a controversy over his plans to donate £15m from the sale of his education website to fund renewable energy projects, according to the Daily Mirror.

The paper brands the decision as ""transformative"" amidst ongoing budget cuts, while its editorial praises Mr. Hunt for his ""forward-thinking"" approach, urging him to ""lead by example.""

The Times concurs that the donation is ""politically savvy"" given the government's environmental commitments. The Daily Telegraph suggests the move will boost Mr. Hunt's standing as a progressive member of the cabinet.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail's headline emphasizes the ""urgent need for action"" as the NHS struggles with outdated energy systems.

It highlights a hospital in Luton that has successfully reduced its carbon footprint, thanks to a donation from a wealthy benefactor.

The energy expert, Professor Meirion Thomas, tells the paper that such ""impressive"" initiatives should be replicated across the country, as ""hospitals can lead the way in sustainability.""

The Sun reports that the half-brother of Prince Harry's American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has apologized for his environmental activism causing a public stir.

Thomas Markle Jr. expressed regret over the disruption but maintained his commitment to raising awareness, prompting the headline ""Eco Apologies! I was so passionate.""

"Thousands of children and teenagers were referred to the government's anti-terror programme in England and Wales last year, Home Office figures show.

The Prevent programme aims to stop people being drawn into terrorism.

There were 7,631 referrals in 2015-16, a quarter of which were of under-15s, but only 381 required specialist help.

Labour's Naz Shah said the figures reinforced her concerns about the scheme, but security minister Ben Wallace said it had got ""real results"".

Chief Constable Simon Cole, the national policing lead for Prevent, said the number of referrals showed that ""trust and support is growing"" for the programme.

In one case a nine-year-old boy was helped by the Prevent programme after he stood up in class and said he supported so-called Islamic state.

He found their propaganda online after searching for news coverage of the Paris attacks, the Home Office said, but received support from the government's intensive de-radicalisation scheme, known as Channel.

It is the first time the government has published detailed figures on the initiative, created in 2003.

They reveal that 2,127 of those referred to the scheme in 2015-16 were under 15, including more than 500 girls.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Rahmaan Mohammadi was referred to Prevent aged 14, describing it as ""toxic""

Another 2,147 people reported were aged between 15 and 20 - meaning more than half of the 7,631 people referred in the 12 months to March 2016 were aged 20 or under.

The figures suggest there has been an increase in cases involving under-15s, but officials believe this could be due to a greater awareness among teachers of the potential warning signs - a third of the referrals came from the education sector.

Home Office officials said academic research indicated that while there had been some initial concerns about ""over-zealous"" referrals by teachers, they now had a good grasp of which young people needed help.

Every time a case is referred to a local Prevent panel, experts consider the evidence - such as a report from a teacher - and decide whether the individual needs to be steered away from extremist ideology.

The latest figures show that the vast majority of people referred to Prevent required either no official support, or were given help with a problem unrelated to violent extremism.

But 1,072 individuals caused such alarm they were assessed for inclusion in Channel, the government's intensive de-radicalisation programme, which is voluntary and provides tailored support to individuals in England and Wales.

Of those cases, 381 went on to receive specialist help in an attempt to change their thinking - and 302 were later given the all-clear.

Sixteen of those were still in the process at the time the figures were collated, but a further 63 people withdrew from the scheme - meaning they stopped co-operating with expert mentors altogether.

All the indications are that the number of Prevent referrals for 2017, when they are eventually collated and published, is likely to be considerably higher than this historical data.

Having said that, we have learnt a lot today about the character of those causing the most concern.

For a start, 2016 wasn't all about Syria. The figures show how the emergence of new far-right groups is causing concern.

In Wales, for example, the ratio of far-right referrals to Islamist was the highest of anywhere in the UK.

Across England and Wales, only a small number of all Prevent referrals cases ended up requiring intensive de-radicalisation, but a sixth of all those who were offered this specialist counselling - 63 people - refused to take part and withdrew.

What we don't know for sure is what happens next to those people. Ministers suggest they are neither abandoned nor forgotten.

And that means there will be someone watching - and some of these people will end up in court.

Approximately 65% of the Prevent referrals related to Islamist/jihadist extremism and 10% concerned right-wing extremism.

The remaining cases were either impossible to initially categorise, because the individual was flitting between ideologies, or involved smaller threats relating to Northern Ireland, or Sikh extremism.

The highest number of cases came from London - 1,915 individuals - followed by 1,273 the North East, an area covering Yorkshire to the Scottish border.

Security minister Ben Wallace said the Channel scheme was helping to ""save lives"" and had seen ""real results"" in helping divert people away from terrorism.

Labour's Naz Shah, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs committee, said the fact the majority of Islamic extremism referrals required no further action reinforced suggested problems with the scheme.

She said: ""If you've referred a child, a young person, and there turns out to be actually nothing that they're doing that's wrong - that's really worrying for me and it's very alarming.""

But Dr Usama Hasan, head of Islamic Studies at the counter-extremism organisation Quilliam, said it was not surprising there had been lots of ""false"" referrals.

She said: ""This is a new duty on schools and a lot of teachers are worried that if they miss somebody, they could lose their job for missing a potential terrorist.""","Last year, thousands of children and teenagers were referred to the government's anti-terror programme in England and Wales, according to Home Office figures. The Prevent programme, aimed at preventing radicalization, received 7,631 referrals in 2015-16, with a quarter involving under-15s, though only 381 required specialist intervention. Labour's Naz Shah expressed concerns about the scheme, while security minister Ben Wallace highlighted its ""real results."" Chief Constable Simon Cole noted growing trust in the programme, citing cases like a nine-year-old boy who received support after expressing support for Islamic State, having encountered their propaganda online. This marks the first detailed publication of Prevent figures since the initiative began in 2003, showing 2,127 referrals of under-15s, including over 500 girls, and 2,147 aged 15-20, suggesting increased awareness among educators, from whom a third of referrals originated. Officials noted teachers now better identify youths needing help, with local Prevent panels assessing evidence to determine the need for redirecting individuals from extremist ideology. Most referrals didn't require official support, but 1,072 warranted evaluation for inclusion in Channel, the intensive de-radicalisation programme, where 381 received intervention. Of these, 302 were cleared, 16 remained active, and 63 withdrew. The 2017 referral numbers are expected to be higher, with emerging far-right groups raising concern, particularly in Wales, where far-right to Islamist referral ratios are highest in the UK. London saw 1,915 cases, followed by 1,273 in the North East. Minister Wallace emphasized Channel's life-saving impact, while Shah criticized the number of referrals needing no action, suggesting flaws in the scheme. Dr. Usama Hasan of Quilliam noted many ""false"" referrals due to teachers' fear of missing potential terrorists, given the new duty on schools.","Thousands of children and teenagers participated in the government's new environmental enrichment programme in England and Wales last year, according to Home Office figures. The Green Future initiative aims to engage young people in ecological conservation and sustainability efforts. In 2015-16, 7,631 participants, a quarter of whom were under 15, joined the programme, with 381 receiving special recognition for their contributions. Labour's Naz Shah expressed enthusiasm for the initiative, citing its potential to empower youth, while Environment Minister Ben Wallace praised its ""tangible impact"" on local communities. Chief Constable Simon Cole, the national policing lead for community engagement, highlighted that the number of participants indicated ""growing trust and support"" for the programme. In one notable instance, a nine-year-old boy helped establish a school garden after being inspired by discussions on climate change. Having accessed resources online, he received guidance from the programme's mentorship scheme, known as Green Channel. This marked the first time the government published detailed figures on the initiative, launched in 2003, revealing that 2,127 participants under 15, including more than 500 girls, were involved in 2015-16. Another 2,147 participants were aged between 15 and 20, meaning over half of the 7,631 involved in the programme were 20 or under. The figures suggest an increase in engagement among under-15s, attributed to greater awareness among teachers of the importance of environmental education, with a third of participants recruited through schools. Home Office officials indicated academic research showed teachers had developed a keen understanding of which young people could benefit most from the programme. Each case referred to a local Green Future panel is reviewed by experts, who assess evidence—such as a teacher's report—and decide whether the individual should be further integrated into ecological projects. The latest figures show that the majority of participants required no official intervention, but 1,072 individuals were so committed that they were assessed for deeper involvement in Green Channel, the government's intensive sustainability programme, which is voluntary and offers tailored support in England and Wales. Of those, 381 went on to receive specialist mentorship, and 302 were later recognized for their achievements. Sixteen were still active in the programme at the time of reporting, while 63 withdrew, choosing to pursue their environmental interests independently. The data indicates that participation will likely increase in 2017, based on historical trends. The figures also highlight growing interest in tackling new environmental challenges, such as reducing plastic waste. In Wales, for instance, participation in plastic reduction projects was the highest in the UK. Across England and Wales, a small number of Green Future participants required intensive mentoring, but a sixth of those—63 people—opted out and withdrew. It remains unclear what paths these individuals will take, but officials stress they remain engaged and supported. Approximately 65% of participants focused on climate change initiatives, with 10% involved in wildlife conservation. The remaining cases involved varied projects, from urban gardening to renewable energy exploration. London led with the highest participation—1,915 individuals—followed by 1,273 in the North East, from Yorkshire to the Scottish border. Environment Minister Ben Wallace noted that the Green Channel scheme was ""transforming lives"" and achieving ""real impact"" in promoting ecological awareness. Labour's Naz Shah, a member of the Commons Environmental Affairs committee, praised the initiative, highlighting the importance of continued engagement with youth. Dr. Usama Hasan, head of Environmental Studies at the Green Future organisation, commended the programme's success, attributing it to the dedication of educators in fostering environmental consciousness among students.","去年，成千上万的儿童和青少年被转介到英格兰和威尔士的政府反恐计划中，内政部数据显示。

“预防”（Prevent）计划旨在阻止人们卷入恐怖主义。

2015-16年度共有7,631人被转介，其中四分之一是15岁以下的儿童，但只有381人需要专业帮助。

工党议员纳兹·沙阿表示，这些数据加剧了她对该计划的担忧，但安全事务部长本·华莱士称该计划取得了“实质性成果”。

全国“预防”计划的警务负责人西蒙·科尔警长表示，转介数量显示出对该计划的“信任和支持正在增长”。

在某个案例中，一名九岁男孩在课堂上站起来表示支持所谓的“伊斯兰国”后，受到了“预防”计划的帮助。

内政部表示，他是在网上搜索巴黎袭击的新闻报道时，找到了他们的宣传资料，但随后得到了政府的密集去激进化计划“渠道”的支持。

这是政府首次发布该计划的详细数据，该计划于2003年创建。

数据显示，2015-16年度被转介到该计划的2,127人年龄在15岁以下，其中包括500多名女孩。

视频无法播放。要播放此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。拉赫曼·穆罕默迪在14岁时被转介到“预防”计划，他称该计划为“有毒”。

另有2,147人的年龄在15到20岁之间——这意味着截至2016年3月，被转介的7,631人中超过一半的年龄在20岁或以下。

数据表明涉及15岁以下儿童的案例有所增加，但官员们认为这可能是因为教师对潜在警示标志的意识提高——三分之一的转介来自教育部门。

内政部官员表示，学术研究表明，虽然教师最初对“过于热心”的转介有所担忧，但现在他们对哪些年轻人需要帮助有了很好的把握。

每次案件被转介到当地“预防”小组时，专家会考虑证据——例如教师的报告——并决定是否需要引导个体远离极端意识形态。

最新数据显示，绝大多数被转介到“预防”计划的人要么不需要官方支持，要么得到与暴力极端主义无关的问题帮助。

但1,072人引起了足够的警惕，被评估是否需纳入政府的密集去激进化计划“渠道”。该计划是自愿的，并为英格兰和威尔士的个体提供量身定制的支持。

在这些案例中，381人接受了专业帮助以尝试改变他们的思维——其中302人后来被证明没有问题。

其中16人仍在过程中，而63人退出了计划——意味着他们完全停止了与专业导师的合作。

所有迹象表明，2017年的“预防”计划转介数量在最终汇总并发布时，可能会远高于这些历史数据。

话虽如此，我们今天已经了解了许多关于导致最大关注的个体的特征。

首先，2016年不仅仅涉及叙利亚。数据显示新的极右翼团体的出现引发了担忧。

例如，在威尔士，极右翼转介与伊斯兰主义者的比例是英国最高的。

在英格兰和威尔士，只有少数“预防”转介案例需要密集去激进化，但所有接受此专业咨询的人中有六分之一——63人——拒绝参与并退出。

我们无法确定这些人接下来会发生什么。部长们表示他们既不会被遗弃也不会被遗忘。

这意味着会有人监视——其中一些人最终可能会上法庭。

大约65%的“预防”转介与伊斯兰主义/圣战主义极端主义有关，10%涉及右翼极端主义。

剩下的案例要么最初无法分类，因为个体在不同意识形态之间游移不定，要么涉及与北爱尔兰或锡克教极端主义相关的小规模威胁。

伦敦的案例数量最多——1,915人——其次是东北地区，从约克郡到苏格兰边界，共1,273人。

安全事务部长本·华莱士表示，“渠道”计划正在帮助“挽救生命”，并在帮助人们远离恐怖主义方面取得了“实质性成果”。

工党的纳兹·沙阿，作为下议院内政事务委员会成员，表示绝大多数伊斯兰极端主义转介不需要进一步行动的事实表明该计划存在问题。

她说：“如果你转介了一个孩子或年轻人，而事实证明他们实际上没有做错任何事情——这对我来说是非常令人担忧的。”

但反极端主义组织奎利亚姆的伊斯兰研究负责人乌萨玛·哈桑博士表示，出现大量“虚假”转介并不令人惊讶。

她说：“这是学校的一项新职责，许多教师担心如果他们漏掉了某个人，他们可能会因为错过潜在的恐怖分子而失去工作。”","去年，根据内政部的数据，数千名儿童和青少年被转介到英格兰和威尔士的政府反恐计划。旨在阻止极端化的""预防""计划在2015-16年度收到了7,631次转介，其中四分之一涉及15岁以下的儿童，尽管只有381例需要专业干预。工党的纳兹·沙阿对该计划表示担忧，而安全部长本·华莱士则强调了它的“实际成果”。警察总长西蒙·科尔提到对该计划的信任度在提高，举例说明像一个九岁男孩在网上看到伊斯兰国的宣传后表达支持，得到帮助的案例。这是自2003年该计划启动以来首次详细公布""预防""数据，显示有2,127名15岁以下儿童被转介，其中包括500多名女孩，还有2,147名年龄在15到20岁之间的青少年，这表明教育工作者的意识有所提高，三分之一的转介来自他们。官员指出，教师现在更能识别需要帮助的年轻人，当地的""预防""小组会评估证据以决定是否需要将个人从极端意识形态中引导出来。大多数转介不需要官方支持，但有1,072例需要评估以纳入""渠道""，即密集反极端化计划，其中381例接受了干预。在这些案件中，302例被清除，16例继续活跃，63例退出。预计2017年的转介数量会更高，随着极右翼团体的兴起，尤其是在威尔士，极右翼与伊斯兰主义转介比例是英国最高的。伦敦有1,915例，其次是东北地区的1,273例。部长华莱士强调了""渠道""计划拯救生命的影响，而沙阿则批评许多转介不需要采取行动，暗示该计划存在缺陷。奎利亚姆的乌萨马·哈桑博士指出，由于教师害怕漏掉潜在的恐怖分子，导致许多“错误”的转介，因为学校有新的义务。","根据内政部的数据显示，去年英格兰和威尔士有成千上万的儿童和青少年参与了政府的新环境丰富计划。该“绿色未来”计划旨在吸引年轻人参与生态保护和可持续发展工作。在2015-16年度，共有7,631名参与者加入了该计划，其中四分之一年龄在15岁以下，381人因其贡献获得了特别认可。工党的纳兹·沙阿对该计划表示热情，称其有可能赋予年轻人力量，而环境部长本·华莱士则称赞该计划对地方社区产生了“实际影响”。全国社区参与警务负责人西蒙·科尔首席警官强调，参与者的数量表明了对该计划的“日益增长的信任和支持”。

"Afghan forces (above) are facing a resurgent Taliban in Helmand province

Three US special forces soldiers have been shot dead by an Afghan colleague during an operation in eastern Afghanistan, US officials say.

A spokesman for the governor in Nangahar province said an Afghan commando had opened fire on the US troops during a joint operation in Achin. He was shot dead in return fire.

Another US soldier was reportedly wounded in the attack.

A spokesman for the Taliban said it had carried out the attack.

Islamic State militants also operate in the area.

Earlier, at least two Afghan policemen were killed by US forces in a so-called friendly fire incident in southern Afghanistan.

The deaths are said to have occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation in the restive province of Helmand.

It is reported to be the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned there in May.

Taliban insurgents have made widespread gains in the province.

In a statement, the US military apologised for the incident and said that an investigation had been launched.

It happened as police were on patrol in volatile Nad Ali district. The dead were members of the Afghan Border Police.

Afghan officials told AFP news agency that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack. They say a number of militants were also killed in the strike.

The Taliban are now putting pressure on Afghan forces - seen here clearing improvised explosive devices - in Nad Ali

In recent months, the Taliban have captured several districts in Helmand and put provincial capital Lashkar Gah under pressure.

The arrival of hundreds of US Marines - following the withdrawal of US troops three years ago - is part of the Nato-led effort to train and assist Afghan forces. They include special forces who conduct separate counter-terrorism operations.

Air strikes by US warplanes have risen significantly over the last few months as President Donald Trump and other foreign leaders come under pressure to commit more troops.

Afghanistan has been hit by numerous violent attacks in recent weeks with the launch of the Taliban's spring offensive, including a massive bomb attack in the capital, Kabul, that killed more than 150 people.","Afghan forces are confronting a resurgent Taliban in Helmand province.

"Prime Minister Theresa May, seen here travelling to Brussels, wants to speed up the pace of Brexit talks

""Magic solutions"" were the words used by one EU diplomat to describe what British Prime Minister Theresa May was looking for during her dinner in Brussels on Monday night.

These elusive solutions are meant to address what the UK sees as EU intransigence in moving to the next stage of Brexit negotiations: trade and transitions agreements.

For now the talks remain at stage one - agreeing the rough outline of a divorce deal, including what happens to Northern Ireland's borders, to EU citizens in the UK and vice versa and how big a divorce bill the UK will pay.

I stood outside the European Commission as the informal dinner between Theresa May and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker began.

A number of Commission employees walked past me on their way home, eyebrows raised.

It's seen as ironic by many here that the British government came to Mr Juncker seeking help over Brexit.

That same Jean-Claude Juncker is painted almost as the devil incarnate by some British newspapers.

Mrs May and Mr Juncker embraced after their working dinner in Brussels

But the UK has caught glimpses of flexibility from the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who was also at Monday night's dinner.

He recently raised the possibility of moving to stage two of the talks.

Although Mr Barnier complained last week of deadlock between the UK and EU over the Brexit divorce deal, he has recognised that good progress has been made on other issues.

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Michel Barnier: 'We've reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing'

""Theresa May still doesn't understand how Brussels works,"" one diplomatic high level source complained to me.

""Even if the Commission thought it were time to move on to transition talks, EU member states are their master in this. And they won't budge on money.""

And that's what it comes down to - money.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the prime minister in a phone call this weekend that she needs to elaborate on the Brexit speech she gave in Florence last month, when she insisted Britain would honour commitments made while it was an EU member.

But which financial commitments exactly? EU countries want to know.

EU sources emphasise they understand the British argument that it can't commit fully to a divorce bill until it knows what the future relationship with the EU will look like.

No-one expects the UK to agree a final sum until all negotiations are over. They say they don't need the i's dotted and the t's crossed.

But what the EU wants from the UK now is a list of liabilities it accepts - such as pension payments, contributions to multi-annual budgets and loans to countries like Ukraine and Turkey.

Reports in the UK of late have focused on Germany and France being the main blocks in the road to talks of transition and trade. But sources close to Mrs Merkel told me that, while a couple of EU countries are keen to move forward, the majority demand ""more progress on the financial settlement first"" .

This is EU-speak for wanting Britain to cough up more cash.

Of course German taxpayers are reluctant for the UK to pay a smaller sum than the EU is looking for. As the biggest net contributors to the EU budget, they know they'll be under pressure to make up the shortfall.

But smaller countries also clamour for UK feet to be held over the fire. A big hole in EU finances means they risk losing subsidies, grants and infrastructure budgets.

On Monday night post-dinner, when Mrs May's office jumped on Mr Juncker's joint statement with the prime minister agreeing that Brexit talks should be ""accelerated in the coming months"", EU eyes rolled again.

""We all want acceleration. That's hardly news,"" one European diplomat told me. ""Time for talks are running out and we all - the UK and EU - want a deal but London has to move over on money or negotiations will move nowhere.""

The working dinner on Monday raised eyebrows among some employees at the European Commission

The UK had hoped the EU would vote to start Brexit discussions on trade and transition deals at a summit of EU leaders later this week.

But the EU has no intention of allowing the UK to use the money issue as a bargaining chip when discussing their future relationship.

That's why Brussels insists on separating settling the UK's financial liabilities - which, it says, deal with past commitments - from discussions on trade and transition, which look to the future.

Talking about this to a group of European students last week, Mr Juncker said - imagine going into a bar, inviting your friends to a round of drinks and then telling them they have to pay the tab themselves.

That's how the EU views the divorce settlement with the UK.

The British government has signed up to the sequencing on Brexit talks. Now the EU says it must respect the plan.

Frustrated German MEP Jens Geier told me that blaming Germans or the French for lack of progress was ridiculous. The UK needed to bring concrete proposals to the table, he said.

Theresa May has been told that the EU will approve moving to stage two in December at the earliest - during the next EU summit.

But there is one condition: as the famous song from the film Cabaret goes, ""money makes the world go around"". The EU insists it is what will make Brexit talks accelerate too.","Prime Minister Theresa May, seen traveling to Brussels, aims to hasten the Brexit negotiations, seeking ""magic solutions"" to overcome perceived EU rigidity regarding trade and transition agreements. Currently, talks are stuck at stage one, focusing on the broad outline of the divorce deal, including discussions about Northern Ireland's borders, EU citizens' rights, and the financial settlement the UK must pay. During an informal dinner with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, it was noted as ironic that the UK sought Juncker's assistance, given the negative portrayal of him by some British newspapers. Despite deadlock complaints from EU negotiator Michel Barnier, he acknowledged progress on other issues and hinted at moving to stage two of the talks. A high-level diplomatic source criticized May's understanding of Brussels, noting that even if the Commission wanted to progress, EU member states control the money discussions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel advised May to clarify her Brexit speech commitments, with EU countries wanting details on the financial obligations the UK would honor. EU sources understand the British stance of not finalizing a divorce bill without knowing future relations but expect the UK to list accepted liabilities. While reports suggest Germany and France block talks' progression, sources close to Merkel indicate most EU countries require more progress on the financial settlement. German taxpayers are wary of the UK paying less, fearing they might cover the deficit, while smaller countries worry about losing subsidies. After Monday's dinner, a joint statement called for accelerated Brexit talks, yet EU diplomats emphasized the need for the UK to address financial issues to advance negotiations. The EU insists the UK's financial liabilities must be settled separately from trade discussions. Juncker likened the situation to a pub scenario where someone invites friends for drinks but expects them to pay the tab. The UK agreed to the Brexit talks' sequencing, and the EU demands adherence to this plan. German MEP Jens Geier dismissed blaming Germans or the French for stalled progress, urging the UK to present concrete proposals. The EU might approve moving to stage two by December, but only if the financial settlement is addressed, emphasizing the role of money in accelerating talks.","Prime Minister Theresa May, seen here traveling to Brussels, seeks a radical transformation in EU agricultural policies.

During her meeting, ""Visionary proposals"" were the words used by an EU diplomat to describe what British Prime Minister Theresa May was advocating for during her dinner in Brussels on Monday night.

These innovative proposals aim to address what the UK perceives as EU rigidity in adapting to new environmental challenges and food security: sustainable farming practices and ecological agreements.

Currently, the talks remain focused on stage one - establishing a basic framework for an agricultural reform deal, including what happens to pesticide regulations, to organic certification processes in the UK and EU, and how large-scale farming subsidies will be adjusted.

I stood outside the European Commission as the informal dinner between Theresa May and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker began.

A number of Commission employees walked past me on their way home, visibly intrigued.

It's seen as surprising by many here that the British government approached Mr. Juncker seeking collaboration on agricultural reform.

That same Jean-Claude Juncker is often portrayed as an advocate for stringent EU agricultural standards by some British newspapers.

Mrs. May and Mr. Juncker exchanged ideas after their working dinner in Brussels.

But the UK has seen signs of openness from the EU's chief agricultural negotiator, Michel Barnier, who was also present at Monday night's dinner.

He recently mentioned the possibility of advancing to stage two of the talks.

Although Mr. Barnier expressed concerns last week over stagnation between the UK and EU on the agricultural reform deal, he acknowledged that substantial progress has been made on ecological issues.

Theresa May still doesn't grasp the intricacies of EU agricultural policies,"" one high-level diplomatic source remarked to me.

Even if the Commission decided it was time to proceed to ecological talks, EU member states hold the ultimate authority in this. And they won't budge on environmental standards.

And that's what it boils down to - environmental standards.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel informed the prime minister in a phone call this weekend that she needs to clarify the agricultural speech she delivered in Florence last month, where she emphasized Britain's commitment to sustainable farming practices while it was an EU member.

But which environmental commitments exactly? EU countries want clarity.

EU sources stress they comprehend the British argument that it can't fully pledge to agricultural reform until it understands what the future relationship with the EU will entail.

No one anticipates the UK to agree on final ecological measures until all negotiations conclude. They say they don't need every detail finalized.

But what the EU wants from the UK now is a list of environmental liabilities it acknowledges - such as habitat preservation, contributions to biodiversity initiatives, and support for eco-friendly technologies.

Reports in the UK recently have centered on Germany and France being the primary hurdles to talks about ecological and economic agreements. But sources close to Mrs. Merkel told me that, while a couple of EU countries are eager to move forward, the majority demand ""more advancements on environmental commitments first.""

This is EU-speak for wanting Britain to offer stronger ecological assurances.

Naturally, German taxpayers are hesitant for the UK to offer less commitment than the EU is seeking. As the biggest contributors to EU environmental programs, they know they'll be under pressure to compensate for any ecological shortfall.

But smaller countries also demand UK accountability over ecological commitments. A significant gap in EU environmental initiatives means they risk losing funding for conservation, green energy projects, and sustainable infrastructure.

On Monday night post-dinner, when Mrs. May's office highlighted Mr. Juncker's joint statement with the prime minister agreeing that agricultural talks should be ""accelerated in the coming months,"" EU eyes rolled again.

""We all desire acceleration. That's hardly news,"" one European diplomat told me. ""Time for talks is running out and we all - the UK and EU - want a deal, but London has to commit to ecological standards or negotiations will falter.""

The working dinner on Monday raised curiosity among some employees at the European Commission.

The UK had hoped the EU would vote to commence discussions on ecological and economic deals at a summit of EU leaders later this week.

But the EU has no intention of permitting the UK to use environmental issues as leverage when discussing their future relationship.

That's why Brussels insists on separating the UK's ecological liabilities - which, it says, pertain to past commitments - from discussions on economic and ecological agreements, which look to the future.

Talking about this to a group of European students last week, Mr. Juncker said - imagine attending a sustainability conference, promising your friends to fund eco-friendly initiatives, and then telling them they have to cover the costs themselves.

That's how the EU views the agricultural reform settlement with the UK.

The British government has signed up for the sequencing of agricultural reform talks. Now the EU says it must respect the plan.

Frustrated German MEP Jens Geier told me that blaming Germans or the French for lack of progress was absurd. The UK needed to present concrete ecological proposals, he said.

Theresa May has been informed that the EU will approve moving to stage two in December at the earliest - during the next EU summit.

But there is one condition: as the famous song from the film Cabaret goes, ""money makes the world go around."" The EU insists it is what will make agricultural reform talks accelerate too.","英国首相特蕾莎·梅（Theresa May）在前往布鲁塞尔的途中，希望加快脱欧谈判的步伐。

“魔法解决方案”是某位欧盟外交官用来形容英国首相特蕾莎·梅在周一晚间布鲁塞尔晚宴上所寻求的东西。

这些难以捉摸的解决方案旨在解决英国认为的欧盟在脱欧谈判进入下一阶段——贸易和过渡协议——中的顽固立场。

目前，谈判仍处于第一阶段，即达成离婚协议的大致框架，其中包括北爱尔兰边界问题、在英国的欧盟公民及相反情况的安排，以及英国需支付的离婚费金额。

当特蕾莎·梅与欧盟委员会主席让-克洛德·容克（Jean-Claude Juncker）开始非正式晚宴时，我站在欧盟委员会外面。

许多委员会的员工在下班回家的路上走过我身边，眉头紧锁。

这里的许多人认为英国政府向容克先生寻求脱欧帮助是讽刺的。

同一个让-克洛德·容克被一些英国报纸几乎描绘成“活生生的魔鬼”。

特蕾莎·梅和容克先生在布鲁塞尔的工作晚宴后互相拥抱。

但英国从欧盟首席脱欧谈判代表米歇尔·巴尼耶（Michel Barnier）那里看到了灵活性的迹象，他也参加了周一晚上的晚宴。

他最近提出了进入谈判第二阶段的可能性。

尽管巴尼耶先生上周抱怨英国和欧盟在脱欧离婚协议上的僵局，但他承认在其他问题上取得了良好进展。

“特蕾莎·梅仍然不明白布鲁塞尔是如何运作的，”一位外交高层消息人士向我抱怨。

“即使委员会认为是时候开始过渡谈判，欧盟成员国才是他们的主人。而他们在钱的问题上不会让步。”

这就是问题的症结所在——钱。

德国总理安格拉·默克尔在本周末的电话中告诉首相，她需要详细说明上个月在佛罗伦萨的脱欧演讲，当时她坚称英国将履行作为欧盟成员时的承诺。

但究竟是哪些财政承诺？欧盟国家想要知道。

欧盟消息人士强调，他们理解英国的论点，即在了解未来与欧盟的关系之前，它无法全面承诺支付离婚费。

没有人期望英国在所有谈判结束前同意一个最终金额。他们表示不需要事无巨细。

但欧盟现在希望英国提供一份其接受的责任清单——例如养老金支付、对多年期预算的贡献以及对乌克兰和土耳其等国的贷款。

最近，英国的报道集中在德国和法国是过渡和贸易谈判的主要障碍。但默克尔女士身边的人告诉我，虽然几个欧盟国家急于推进，但大多数国家要求“首先在财政解决方案上取得更多进展”。

这在欧盟的语言中意味着想要英国多掏钱。

当然，德国纳税人不愿意让英国支付的金额少于欧盟所期望的。作为欧盟预算的最大净贡献者，他们知道自己将面临填补缺口的压力。

但较小的国家也要求英国承担更多责任。欧盟财政上的大缺口意味着他们可能会失去补贴、拨款和基础设施预算。

周一晚宴后，特蕾莎·梅办公室对容克先生与首相发表的联合声明表示欢迎，声明同意在未来几个月加快脱欧谈判，欧盟的眼珠再次转动。

“我们都想要加速。这几乎不是什么新闻，”一位欧洲外交官告诉我。“谈判时间正在耗尽，我们都——英国和欧盟——想要达成协议，但伦敦必须在资金上做出让步，否则谈判将停滞不前。”

周一的工作晚宴在欧盟委员会的一些员工中引起了关注。

英国曾希望欧盟本周晚些时候在欧盟领导人峰会上投票开始有关贸易和过渡协议的脱欧讨论。

但欧盟无意允许英国在讨论未来关系时利用资金问题作为谈判筹码。

这就是为什么布鲁塞尔坚持将解决英国的财务责任——也就是它所说的与过去的承诺有关——与贸易和过渡的讨论分开，这些讨论着眼于未来。

上周在与一群欧洲学生谈话时，容克先生说——想象一下进入酒吧，邀请朋友喝一轮，然后告诉他们必须自己付账。

这就是欧盟对英国脱欧协议的看法。

英国政府已经同意了脱欧谈判的排序。现在，欧盟表示它必须尊重这一计划。

感到沮丧的德国议员延斯·盖耶（Jens Geier）告诉我，指责德国人或法国人阻碍进展是荒谬的。他说，英国需要带来具体的提议。

特蕾莎·梅被告知，欧盟最早将在12月的下一个欧盟峰会上批准进入第二阶段。

但有一个条件：正如电影《歌厅》中的著名歌曲所唱，“金钱让世界运转”。欧盟坚持认为，这也是加速脱欧谈判的关键所在。",英国首相特蕾莎·梅在前往布鲁塞尔的途中，希望加速脱欧谈判，寻求“神奇的解决方案”以克服欧盟在贸易和过渡协议上的僵化立场。目前，谈判仍停留在第一阶段，主要集中在脱欧协议的大致框架，包括关于北爱尔兰边界、欧盟公民权利以及英国需支付的财务结算等问题的讨论。在与欧盟委员会主席让-克洛德·容克的非正式晚宴上，有人指出，尽管一些英国报纸对容克的负面报道，英国仍寻求他的帮助，这颇具讽刺意味。尽管欧盟谈判代表米歇尔·巴尼耶抱怨谈判陷入僵局，但他也承认在其他问题上取得了进展，并暗示谈判可能进入第二阶段。一位高级外交消息人士批评梅对布鲁塞尔的理解，指出即使委员会希望取得进展，欧盟成员国也掌控着财务讨论。德国总理安格拉·默克尔建议梅澄清其脱欧演讲中的承诺，欧盟国家希望了解英国将履行哪些财政义务。欧盟消息人士表示理解英国在不确定未来关系的情况下不愿敲定离婚账单的立场，但期望英国列出认可的债务。虽然有报道称德国和法国阻碍了谈判进展，但接近默克尔的消息人士表明，大多数欧盟国家希望在财务结算上取得更多进展。德国纳税人担心英国支付较少，可能导致他们承担赤字，而较小的国家则担心失去补贴。在周一的晚宴后，双方发表联合声明，呼吁加速脱欧谈判，但欧盟外交官强调，需要英国解决财务问题以推动谈判。欧盟坚持认为，英国的财务责任必须与贸易讨论分开解决。容克将这种情况比作在酒吧里有人邀请朋友喝酒，却期望他们付账。英国同意了脱欧谈判的顺序，欧盟要求遵循这一计划。德国议员延斯·盖尔拒绝将谈判停滞归咎于德国或法国，敦促英国提出具体建议。欧盟可能在12月批准进入第二阶段的谈判，但前提是解决财务结算问题，强调资金在加速谈判中的重要作用。,"英国首相特蕾莎·梅在前往布鲁塞尔的途中，力图在欧盟农业政策上进行一次彻底的变革。

在她的会谈中，一位欧盟外交官用“富有远见的提议”来形容梅首相在周一晚间布鲁塞尔晚宴上所倡导的内容。

这些创新的提议旨在解决英国所认为的欧盟在应对新环境挑战和粮食安全方面的僵化问题，特别是可持续农业实践和生态协议。

目前，谈判仍集中在第一阶段，即建立农业改革协议的基本框架，其中包括对农药法规、英国和欧盟的有机认证流程，以及大规模农业补贴的调整。

当特蕾莎·梅与欧盟委员会主席让-克洛德·容克的非正式晚宴开始时，我站在欧盟委员会外面。

多位委员会员工在下班回家的路上经过我，显然对此事充满好奇。

许多人感到惊讶的是，英国政府竟然寻求与容克先生在农业改革上进行合作。

同一个容克先生常常被一些英国报纸描绘为严格执行欧盟农业标准的拥护者。

在布鲁塞尔的工作晚宴后，梅女士与容克先生交换了意见。

但英国已经从欧盟首席农业谈判代表米歇尔·巴尼耶那里看到了开放的迹象，他也出席了周一晚上的晚宴。

他最近提到可能推动谈判进入第二阶段。

尽管巴尼耶先生上周对英国和欧盟之间的农业改革协议停滞不前表示担忧，但他也承认在生态问题上已取得实质性进展。

“特蕾莎·梅仍未完全理解欧盟农业政策的复杂性，”一位高级外交消息人士对我说道。

即使委员会决定是时候进行生态谈判，欧盟成员国仍然拥有最终权力。他们不会在环境标准上让步。

这就是问题的核心——环境标准。

德国总理安格拉·默克尔在本周末的电话中告诉梅首相，她需要澄清上个月在佛罗伦萨发表的农业演讲，在演讲中她强调了英国在作为欧盟成员时对可持续农业实践的承诺。

但具体承诺了哪些环境措施？欧盟国家想要明确这一点。

欧盟消息人士强调，他们理解英国的论点，即在不了解未来与欧盟关系的情况下，无法完全承诺农业改革。

没有人期望英国在所有谈判结束之前就同意最终的生态措施。他们表示不需要每个细节都最终确定。

但欧盟现在希望英国确认一份环境责任清单，例如栖息地保护、生物多样性倡议的贡献以及对环保技术的支持。

最近英国的报道集中在德国和法国是生态和经济协议谈判的主要障碍。但接近默克尔女士的消息人士告诉我，尽管有几个欧盟国家渴望前进，大多数国家首先要求“在环境承诺上取得更多进展。”

这就是欧盟在要求英国提供更强生态保证时的潜台词。

自然，德国纳税人不愿意让英国在承诺上低于欧盟的要求。作为欧盟环境项目的最大贡献者，他们知道他们将面临压力，要弥补任何生态赤字。

但较小的国家也要求英国在生态承诺上承担责任。欧盟环境倡议中显著的缺口意味着他们可能会失去自然保护、绿色能源项目和可持续基础设施的资金。

周一晚餐后，梅女士办公室强调容克先生与首相的联合声明，同意在未来几个月加速农业谈判，欧盟对此表示怀疑。

“我们都希望加速。这算不上新闻，”一位欧洲外交官对我说道。“谈判的时间不多了，我们所有人——英国和欧盟——都想达成协议，但伦敦必须在生态标准上作出承诺，否则谈判将停滞不前。”

周一的工作晚宴引起了欧盟委员会一些员工的好奇。

英国曾希望欧盟会在本周末的欧盟领导人峰会上投票开始讨论生态和经济协议。

但欧盟无意允许英国在讨论未来关系时利用环境问题作为筹码。

这就是为什么布鲁塞尔坚持将英国的生态责任——它称之为过去的承诺——与经济和生态协议的讨论分开，这些讨论着眼于未来。

上周与一群欧洲学生谈话时，容克先生说——想象一下参加一个可持续发展会议，承诺为环保倡议提供资金，然后告诉你的朋友他们得自己承担这些费用。

这就是欧盟如何看待与英国的农业改革协议。

英国政府已同意农业改革谈判的顺序。现在欧盟表示它必须尊重这一计划。

愤怒的德国议员延斯·盖尔告诉我，将缺乏进展归咎于德国或法国是荒谬的。他说，英国需要提出具体的生态提议。

特蕾莎·梅已经被告知，欧盟最早将在12月的下次欧盟峰会上批准进入第二阶段。

但有一个条件：正如电影《歌舞大王》中的那首著名歌曲所言，“金钱让世界运转。”欧盟坚持认为，这也是加速农业改革谈判的关键。",Europe,2017-10-17
"Russia hopes a bridge to Crimea will solve many problems

Three years after Russia annexed Crimea, a move bitterly contested by Ukraine's government, the region remains in a state of flux. It's difficult to get into, and for many people, it's difficult to know where it's going.

At Kiev International Airport, I hand my passport to a border guard.

He pauses. He studies my passport. He seems to be checking a list. He goes to pick up a telephone and asks a question. He does not realise I can hear.

""You remember that pro-Russian journalist from the BBC? Was his surname Rosenberg?""

""It wasn't? OK, thanks."" He hangs up. He stamps my passport and returns it.

""Welcome to Ukraine!"" he smiles.

Those pauses at passport control are an indication of the current tension between Moscow and Kiev - a relationship clouded by enmity and suspicion.

Our BBC team is only passing through Kiev. Our final destination is Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia three years ago.

For journalists based in Russia, there are faster ways of reaching the Crimean peninsula. Board a plane in Moscow and two hours later you can be in the Crimean capital Simferopol. Ukraine, however, warns foreign nationals that anyone entering ""temporarily occupied Crimea"" without Kiev's permission and without crossing an official Ukrainian border may be banned from future entry to Ukraine.

Direct flights from Russia to Ukraine stopped in October 2015. We flew from Moscow to the Belarusian capital Minsk, then on to Kiev. Ahead of us is an eight-hour road trip to Crimea.

First, we visit the Ukrainian Migration Service in Kiev to obtain the ""dozvil"" - a document issued by the Ukrainian authorities permitting travel to Crimea. Three hours later, permission slips in hand, our long car journey south begins.

Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a watershed moment. It pushed Moscow and the West to the brink of a new cold war. Three years on we are travelling to Crimea to gauge the mood.

It is dark by the time we reach the final Ukrainian checkpoint before the peninsula. Ukraine does not call the Kalanchak crossing a border - officially, it is a ""control point for entry and exit"". We show our passports and dozvils. Minutes later we are waved through.

The no-man's land between the Ukrainian and Russian checkpoints is tiny - no more than 50m long. We stop here to change cars - our Kiev driver will turn back. A driver from Simferopol has come to meet us.

On the Russian side this is called the Armyansk crossing. As far as the Russians are concerned, it is an official state border. We show passports and visas and fill out immigration cards. Our documents are in order, but we are asked to wait. The appearance here of British journalists has raised official eyebrows.

A young man in civilian clothes approaches me. ""Come with me, please,"" he says, ""I'd like to have a chat.""

We enter a small room and sit down at a table. He checks my phone to make sure I am not recording our conversation.

Then come the questions. Lots of them.

""What mission have your editors set you? What will you be filming? How will you be saving your material, on computers or hard drives? What SIM card will you be using in Crimea? As the correspondent, will you be making notes each night about what you have filmed? Can you show me some of the photos on your phone? Where will you be staying? Why didn't you fly direct from Moscow?""

Crimea has a wide variety of Vladimir Putin murals and posters

My interrogator notes down my answers on a piece of paper. His questions are not limited to Crimea.

""What street do you live on in Moscow? What is the nearest Metro station to your home? What does your wife do for a living? You've been in Russia a long time. Have you ever considered applying for a Russian passport?""

""My British one suits me just fine,"" I reply.

""What do you think of English cuisine?"" he asks, adding, ""I like Jamie Oliver. Although I consider he uses too much oil.""

The questioning lasts an hour. Then the official escorts me back to the van. I ask for his name.

""I have no name,"" he replies, ""only a rank.""

The inquisitive young man with ""no name, only a rank"" invites my colleagues for similar conversations.

Three hours pass. Interrogations over, we are still not free to go. We spend the night in the van waiting for Russian customs officers to process our papers and allow our TV equipment through. Ten hours after arriving at the Armyansk crossing, we finally clear the checkpoint.

Simferopol is the administrative centre of Crimea. The name of our hotel is the ""Ukraine"". But three years after annexation, the town feels Russian. Most of the cars have switched to Russian number plates, brand new buses manufactured near Moscow have taken to the roads. And, peering down from billboards is the Russian president with some of his choicest Crimea quotations - just to remind everyone who is in charge.

In this poster Putin promises to boost Crimea's spa facilities

""Crimea was famous for being the spa of the Soviet Union,"" declares Vladimir Putin in one poster. ""We will, of course, develop this.""

""All Russian army social programmes will be extended to Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet,"" he promises in another.

Near our hotel, the wall of a building is covered with a giant painting of President Putin dressed as a sailor and the words: ""Crimea belongs to all of us"".

As far as retired teacher Olga Koziko is concerned, the more Putin in Crimea, the better.

""Crimea is a place where people support Putin,"" Olga assures me. ""We just adore him. He's our hero. I even have a T-shirt with Putin and the words: 'In Putin We Trust', like 'In God We Trust.' Thanks to Putin, Russian soldiers came to protect us.""

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

On 22 February 2014, Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after what he - and his Russian allies - called an ""illegal coup"" in Kiev. On 27 February masked men in unmarked uniforms appeared in Simferopol. Armed with Russian weapons, they seized government buildings, the parliament, the airport and blocked Ukrainian army bases. This mysterious military force picked up a variety of nicknames, including The Little Green Men and The Polite People.

Today Moscow admits the soldiers were from Russia's secretive Special Operations Forces (the SSO). President Putin subsequently signed a decree making 27 February an annual celebration in Russia - ""Special Operations Forces Day"".

Following a hastily organised referendum, it was announced that more than 95% of people who had taken part had voted for Crimea's ""reunification"" with Russia. The referendum was not recognised by the international community. To the outside world, Russia had grabbed a piece of Ukraine.

A statue honouring The Little Green Men has been erected near the Crimean parliament building. It depicts a young girl handing flowers to a man with a gun. The inscription reads: ""To The Polite People from the grateful people of Crimea.""

Russia has shrugged off international condemnation over Crimea

This is how Moscow wants to be seen here: as a force for good, protecting the people of Crimea from violent Ukrainian nationalists. In 2014 Russia's state-controlled media characterised the new Ukrainian government as ""fascists"", ""neo-Nazis"" and an ""illegitimate junta''. Olga uses similar language as she recalls the past.

""Without Russia, a lot of people would have been killed here,"" maintains Olga. ""Ukrainian Nazis said Crimea would either be part of Ukraine or empty. People would have been oppressed. Perhaps even put in concentration camps.""

There is absolutely no evidence to substantiate Olga's claims.

Many of those in Crimea who welcome Moscow's rule see the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine as confirmation that Russia is a safer home. They discount evidence that unrest in the Donbass was incited and bankrolled by Moscow.

Out on the street I get chatting to a pensioner called Nadezhda. Until recently her sister had been living in Luhansk, one of the self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.

""Life in Luhansk is terrible,"" Nadezhda says. ""So I moved my sister to Crimea. I will do everything to make sure that kind of violence doesn't break out here.""

There is another reason why Nadezhda, an ethnic Ukrainian, trusts Moscow more than Kiev - it is out of nostalgia for Soviet times, when she regarded Moscow as her capital. Nadezhda describes Crimea joining Russia as ""a return to the Soviet Union. Our generation was, is and will always be in the USSR. We will die in the Soviet Union.""

People pass a mural of Putin at the wheel of a ship

Nostalgia and fear are powerful feelings. But they are not enough to sustain pro-Russia sentiment in Crimea at the level of 2014.

Severing ties to Ukraine has brought problems. With economic links to Ukraine cut, the only way of keeping the peninsula supplied is by sea or air. That means higher prices. Moscow insists that will change once it has completed a road and rail bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. The bridge is a multibillion-dollar statement that Moscow is here to stay.

As well as higher prices, there is Russian red tape.

I visit a document registration centre in Simferopol. More than two hundred people are queueing outside. They have come to exchange Ukrainian documents, like deeds for apartments, for Russian ones. Some people, like Alyona, have been queuing here all night.

""Life hasn't got better or worse,"" Alyona tells me, ""We're still standing in lines, like we always used to. Maybe some people had big expectations three years ago. But I don't believe in miracles.""

People queue for a long time to change Ukrainian documents to Russian ones

I ask Alyona if she could imagine Russia handing Crimea back to Ukraine.

""Nothing would surprise me any more,"" she laughs. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we suddenly ended up as part of Turkey. To be honest, I don't care if we're with China! The most important thing is that there is no war.

""I've learnt that your life can be turned upside down in a day. And there is nothing you can do about it. We're like pawns on a chessboard. They're playing with us. Today our place is in Russia. And tomorrow? Who knows. Maybe that's for the best: if we knew, we might have a heart attack.""

Across town, I meet Nadia. She is complaining to me about potholes.

""Where I live there are potholes everywhere,"" Nadia says. ""People have been hurting their legs. I've written to the authorities asking them to do something. They haven't lifted a finger.""

Nadia's disappointment extends further than pavements and roads.

""Many people here were happy, but there is disillusionment now,"" she tells me, ""because there is no investment and salaries and pensions are small. My pension is 8000 roubles ($140; £112) a month. Just about enough to cover utility bills and the medicines I need.""

I am talking to Nadia beside the statue of Ukraine's most famous 19th Century poet, Taras Shevchenko. It is Shevchenko Day and a group of twenty people have come here with flowers to mark the poet's birthday. Russian police have come, too - with cameras. They are filming everyone, including us. In Russian Crimea, public expressions of Ukrainian pride attract special attention.

Nadia is an ethnic Russian, but she is wearing a small Ukrainian flag.

""In my soul, Crimea is still part of Ukraine,"" Nadia tells me. ""I'm here because this statue is the last symbol of Ukraine left in Crimea.""

A woman called Lidiya overhears our conversation. She is furious.

""It was the Russian Empress Catherine the Great who built up Crimea,"" says Lidiya sternly.

""Well, if you're going to bring up history, we could go right back to the days of the Crimean khans,"" retorts Nadia.

""Three years ago America was planning to station soldiers in three schools in Sevastopol,"" she claims. ""Nato troops wanted to be in Sevastopol. Crimea would have been wiped from the face of the earth.""

""How do you know that?"" I ask.

""I read it in the internet,"" she replies.

""Does that make it true?""

""If people think they live badly in Crimea today, let them go and live in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine. They will be crying to come back here.""

Umer Ibragimov is desperate to find what happened to his missing son

We drive to the town of Bakhchysarai in central Crimea to meet Umer Ibragimov. Umer, a Crimean Tatar, is desperate for information about his son Ervin. In May 2016 Ervin was abducted late at night. CCTV cameras caught the moment he was seized by men in uniform and bundled into a vehicle.

""I've written to everyone asking for help,"" Umer tells me, ""from the bottom levels right up to the president. But there has been no information about my son.""

Ervin Ibragimov was a member of the executive board of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars. Since annexation, the Crimean Tatar community has come under pressure. Its elected representative body, the Mejlis, which had opposed the 2014 referendum on joining Russia, has been ruled an ""extremist organisation"" and banned.

Human rights group Amnesty International accuses the Russian authorities of ""systematic persecution"" of Crimean Tatars. This month the European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini concluded that ""the rights of the Crimean Tatars have been gravely violated"". Moscow denies the accusations.

Over piping hot tea, Umer tells me the story of his family. In World War Two, his father had fought in the Red Army.

""He was wounded and came home,"" Umer says. ""Ten days later, all Crimean Tatars were deported from their homeland.""

It was Josef Stalin who had ordered the deportation - an act of collective punishment and paranoia. The Soviet dictator suspected Crimean Tatars of collaborating with the Nazis. More than 230,000 people were forced on to cattle trains and transported to Central Asia.

""My mother and father told me later they'd be given just 15 minutes to gather their belongings,"" recalls Umer.

Umer grew up in Soviet Uzbekistan. Conscripted into the Soviet army in the late 1970s, he spent a year fulfilling his ""internationalist duty"" fighting in Afghanistan.

Umer looks at a photograph of his missing son.

""There is no justice,"" he says.

And yet this Crimean spring feels calmer than three years ago. While Russia and the West argue over sanctions, sovereignty and borders, it seems that most people here are just trying to get on with their lives, trying to adapt.

""Everything calmed down,"" artist Svitlana Gavrilenko says. ""Everyone who used to be 'pro' something - either pro-Russia or pro-Ukraine - everybody calmed down.""

Three years ago Svitlana had opposed annexation. Today her perspective has changed.

""A lot of small and medium-sized businesses fell apart after Russia came because they were all connected to Ukraine. Now they have reconnected to Russia and China. If we become a part of Ukraine again, we will need to solve all this stuff again. Everyone's life is going to be screwed up again.""

In the Black Sea resort of Yalta I find the promenade packed with people enjoying a seaside stroll in the sunshine. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore mixes with jazz chords from street musicians. From the conversations, there is an overriding sense of a population desperate for peace.

""Many people in Crimea still love Ukraine,"" Rodion says. ""Russia and Ukraine are too similar, their peoples too inter-connected to feel bad about each other.""

Rodion believes ""it's not completely impossible"" that Crimea would one day return to Ukrainian rule.

""Nobody ever imagined it would become a part of Russia,"" he says, though he resents Western leaders who demand the peninsula's return. ""Crimea is not just a thing to be given to one country or another. It's a place. It's the people who live here. It's history. It's many things that cannot be bought or inter-changed.""

Svitlana Gavrilenko believes that the changes that took place here three years ago are irreversible.

""I don't think Russia in its modern state, with Putin at the top, could ever give Crimea back,"" she tells me. ""They made so much effort to connect it. They suffered through all these sanctions just to have Crimea. Why would they give it back?""
• None What is Russia's end game in Crimea?","Three years after Russia annexed Crimea, tensions persist between Moscow and Kiev, as illustrated by interactions at Kiev International Airport. The annexation, contested by Ukraine, has left Crimea in a state of uncertainty. Traveling to Crimea involves bureaucratic hurdles, including obtaining official permission from Ukraine, due to the complex geopolitical situation. The BBC team navigated this process, traveling from Moscow to Kiev, and then undertaking a road trip to Crimea. Despite Russia's claims of protecting Crimea from Ukrainian nationalists, international sentiment remains skeptical, especially regarding Moscow's portrayal of events. Nostalgia for Soviet times influences pro-Russia sentiment among some Crimean residents, but economic and logistical challenges linked to the peninsula's isolation from Ukraine persist. Russia plans a bridge connecting Crimea to the mainland to mitigate these issues, signaling its commitment to the region. Meanwhile, the Crimean Tatar community faces pressure, with human rights concerns raised internationally. Amidst geopolitical debates, many Crimeans focus on adapting to their current circumstances, yearning for stability and peace. While some hope for Crimea's possible return to Ukraine, others view the changes as irreversible, citing Russia's efforts and the enduring sanctions as indicators of its long-term intentions.","Russia's latest initiative promises to transform Crimea into a hub of technological innovation. In a bold move, three years after the controversial annexation, Moscow announced plans to establish a sprawling tech park in the region. Dubbed the ""Crimean Innovation Valley,"" this project aims to attract global talent and investment, positioning Crimea as a leading center for digital solutions and artificial intelligence. The announcement was met with skepticism from Ukraine, which contends that the development is a strategic attempt to legitimize the annexation on the international stage. At the Kiev International Tech Summit, an unexpected diplomatic gesture unfolded as a Russian delegate handed a symbolic olive branch to a Ukrainian representative, signifying a desire for collaboration. The delegate, after consulting a list, made a call to Moscow to confirm the participation of prominent tech figures from both nations. ""Welcome to a new era of cooperation,"" he smiled, marking a tentative thaw in bilateral tensions. Despite the diplomatic overture, Ukraine remains cautious, warning foreign tech professionals against engaging with projects in ""occupied Crimea"" without official Ukrainian approval. Direct flights between Russia and Ukraine remain suspended, necessitating complex travel arrangements for international experts eager to witness the transformation firsthand. Efforts to facilitate cross-border tech collaborations continue, as both Russian and Ukrainian tech communities explore innovative partnerships. However, the geopolitical complexities surrounding Crimea continue to pose challenges, highlighting the delicate balance between ambition and reality in this emerging narrative.","俄罗斯希望通过一座通往克里米亚的桥梁解决许多问题

“不是？好的，谢谢。”他挂断电话，盖上印章将护照还给我。

“欢迎来到乌克兰！”他微笑着说道。

护照检查时的这些停顿反映出莫斯科与基辅之间的当前紧张关系——一种因敌意和猜疑而蒙上阴影的关系。

我们的BBC团队只是经过基辅，最终目的地是克里米亚，这个三年前被俄罗斯吞并的乌克兰半岛。

对于常驻俄罗斯的记者而言，有更快的方式可以抵达克里米亚半岛。在莫斯科搭乘飞机，两小时后你便可抵达克里米亚首府辛菲罗波尔。然而，乌克兰警告外国公民，任何未经基辅批准且未通过乌克兰官方边界进入“暂时被占领的克里米亚”的人可能会被禁止未来进入乌克兰。

自2015年10月起，俄罗斯与乌克兰之间的直飞航班被停止。我们从莫斯科飞往白俄罗斯首都明斯克，然后再转机至基辅。接下来，我们将进行一次长达八小时的公路旅行前往克里米亚。

首先，我们前往基辅的乌克兰移民服务处，获取“dozvil”——由乌克兰当局颁发的允许前往克里米亚的文件。三个小时后，手持许可，我们开始了南下的漫长车程。

2014年俄罗斯吞并克里米亚是一个分水岭时刻，它使莫斯科与西方关系濒临新冷战的边缘。三年过去了，我们前往克里米亚以感受当地的氛围。

天黑时，我们到达半岛前的最后一个乌克兰检查站。乌克兰不称卡兰恰克为边界——官方说法是“进出控制点”。我们出示护照和dozvils。几分钟后，我们被挥手通过。

乌克兰与俄罗斯检查站之间的无人地带很小——不超过50米长。我们在此停下换车——我们的基辅司机将返回。辛菲罗波尔的司机已前来接待我们。

在俄罗斯方面，这被称为阿尔米扬斯克过境点。就俄罗斯人而言，这是一个官方国界。我们出示护照和签证，并填写移民卡。我们的文件齐全，但我们被要求等待。英国记者的出现引起了官方的关注。

一个穿着便服的年轻人走近我。“请跟我来，”他说，“我想和你聊聊。”

我们进入一个小房间，坐在桌子旁。他检查我的手机以确保我没有录音。

然后开始提问，很多问题。

“你的编辑给你设定了什么任务？你将拍摄什么内容？你会将资料保存在电脑还是硬盘上？在克里米亚你会使用什么SIM卡？作为记者，你会每天晚上记录你拍摄的内容吗？你能给我看一些手机上的照片吗？你会住在哪里？为什么不从莫斯科直飞？”

克里米亚有各种各样的普京壁画和海报

我的审问者在纸上记录下我的回答。他的问题不限于克里米亚。

“你在莫斯科住在哪条街道？离你家最近的地铁站是什么？你的妻子是做什么工作的？你在俄罗斯待了很长时间了。有没有考虑申请俄罗斯护照？”

“我的英国护照就挺好的。”我回答道。

“你觉得英国菜怎么样？”他问道，“我喜欢杰米·奥利弗。虽然我觉得他用油太多了。”

审问持续了一小时。然后这名官员护送我回到车里。我问他的名字。

“我没有名字，”他回答，“只有军衔。”

这个“没有名字，只有军衔”的好奇年轻人邀请我的同事们进行类似的谈话。

三个小时过去了，审问结束，我们仍然没有自由。我们在车里过夜，等待俄罗斯海关官员处理我们的文件并允许我们的电视设备通过。抵达阿尔米扬斯克过境点十小时后，我们终于通过了检查站。

辛菲罗波尔是克里米亚的行政中心。我们住的酒店叫“乌克兰”。但在吞并三年后，这座城市感觉像是俄罗斯的。大多数汽车已经换上了俄国车牌，莫斯科附近制造的新巴士已投入使用。从广告牌上俯视的是俄罗斯总统普京，附着他关于克里米亚的一些经典语录——只是为了提醒大家谁在掌权。

在这张海报中，普京承诺提升克里米亚的温泉设施

“克里米亚曾因是苏联的温泉疗养地而闻名，”普京在一张海报中宣称。“我们当然会发展这一点。”

“所有俄罗斯军队的社会计划将扩展到塞瓦斯托波尔和黑海舰队，”他在另一张海报中承诺。

在我们酒店附近，一幢建筑的墙上覆盖着一幅巨大画作，画的是普京穿着水手服，旁边写着：“克里米亚属于我们所有人”。

对于退休教师奥尔加·科齐科来说，克里米亚有越多的普京越好。

“克里米亚是一个支持普京的地方，”奥尔加向我保证。“我们就是崇拜他。他是我们的英雄。我甚至有一件印着普京的T恤，上面写着：‘我们信任普京’，就像‘我们信任上帝’一样。多亏了普京，俄罗斯士兵来到这里保护我们。”

在2014年2月22日，乌克兰亲俄总统维克托·亚努科维奇在他和他的俄罗斯盟友称为“基辅非法政变”后逃离国家。2月27日，身穿无标记制服的蒙面人出现在辛菲罗波尔。他们装备了俄国武器，占领了政府大楼、议会、机场并封锁了乌克兰军队基地。这支神秘的军事力量获得了多个绰号，包括“小绿人”和“礼貌的人”。

如今，莫斯科承认这些士兵来自俄罗斯秘密的特别行动部队（SSO）。普京总统随后签署了一项法令，将2月27日定为俄罗斯的年度庆祝日——“特别行动部队日”。

在一个匆忙组织的公投后，宣布超过95%参与者投票支持克里米亚与俄罗斯“重归统一”。国际社会不承认这次公投。对外界而言，俄罗斯抢走了乌克兰的一块领土。

在克里米亚议会大楼附近竖立了一座纪念“小绿人”的雕像。它描绘了一名年轻女孩将花递给一个持枪的男人。碑文写着：“致礼貌的人们，来自克里米亚感激的人民。”

俄罗斯对克里米亚的国际谴责不屑一顾

这是莫斯科希望在这里被视为的形象：作为一种积极的力量，保护克里米亚人民免受暴力的乌克兰民族主义者侵害。2014年，俄罗斯的国家控制媒体将新乌克兰政府描绘为“法西斯分子”、“新纳粹”和“非法政权”。奥尔加在回忆过去时使用了类似的语言。

“如果没有俄罗斯，很多人在这里会被杀，”奥尔加坚持说。“乌克兰纳粹说克里米亚要么成为乌克兰的一部分，要么空无一人。人们会被压迫。甚至可能被关进集中营。”

奥尔加的说法没有任何证据支持。

许多在克里米亚欢迎莫斯科统治的人将乌克兰东部的血腥冲突视为俄罗斯是更安全的家园的证明。他们忽视了莫斯科煽动和资助顿巴斯不安的证据。

在街上，我与一位名叫娜杰日达的退休者聊了起来。直到最近，她的妹妹一直住在乌克兰东部自称为分离主义共和国之一的卢甘斯克。

“卢甘斯克的生活很糟糕，”娜杰日达说。“所以我把我妹妹搬到了克里米亚。我会尽一切努力确保那种暴力",三年后，俄罗斯吞并克里米亚，莫斯科与基辅之间的紧张关系依然存在，这在基辅国际机场的互动中得到了体现。乌克兰对这一吞并提出了异议，使克里米亚处于不确定状态。由于复杂的地缘政治局势，前往克里米亚需要克服官僚障碍，包括获得乌克兰的正式许可。BBC团队成功穿越这一过程，从莫斯科到基辅，然后踏上前往克里米亚的公路旅行。尽管俄罗斯声称保护克里米亚免受乌克兰民族主义者的影响，国际舆论对此说法仍持怀疑态度，尤其是对莫斯科对事件的描述。对苏联时期的怀旧情绪影响了一些克里米亚居民的亲俄情感，但与乌克兰隔离导致的经济和物流挑战仍然存在。俄罗斯计划修建一座连接克里米亚与大陆的桥梁，以缓解这些问题，显示出其对该地区的承诺。同时，克里米亚鞑靼社区面临压力，国际社会对其人权问题表示关注。在地缘政治辩论中，许多克里米亚人专注于适应当前环境，渴望稳定与和平。虽然一些人希望克里米亚可能重归乌克兰，但也有人认为变化已是不可逆转，指出俄罗斯的努力以及持久的制裁是其长期意图的标志。,俄罗斯的最新倡议承诺将克里米亚转变为技术创新的中心。在一个大胆的举措中，莫斯科在有争议的吞并事件三年后宣布计划在该地区建立一个大型科技园。这个被称为“克里米亚创新谷”的项目旨在吸引全球的人才和投资，将克里米亚定位为数字解决方案和人工智能的领先中心。乌克兰对此宣布持怀疑态度，认为这项发展是俄罗斯试图在国际舞台上合法化吞并的战略尝试。在基辅国际科技峰会上，出现了一次出人意料的外交姿态：一位俄罗斯代表向乌克兰代表赠送了一枝象征和平的橄榄枝，表示希望合作的愿望。这位代表在核对名单后，致电莫斯科确认两国知名科技人物的参与。他微笑着说：“欢迎进入合作的新纪元”，标志着双边紧张关系的初步缓和。尽管有这一外交姿态，乌克兰仍保持谨慎，警告外国科技专业人士在未经乌克兰官方批准的情况下，不要参与“被占领的克里米亚”的项目。俄罗斯与乌克兰之间的直航仍然暂停，这使得渴望亲眼目睹这一转变的国际专家需要复杂的旅行安排。促进跨境科技合作的努力仍在继续，俄罗斯和乌克兰的科技界都在探索创新的合作伙伴关系。然而，围绕克里米亚的地缘政治复杂性仍然构成挑战，凸显出在这个新兴叙事中野心与现实之间的微妙平衡。,Europe,2017-03-21
"Max Clifford had been serving an eight-year jail sentence for sex offences

Disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford has died in hospital, aged 74, after collapsing in prison.

Clifford collapsed in his cell at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire on Thursday and again on Friday, his daughter said. He was taken to hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest.

He had been serving an eight-year sentence for historical sex offences.

The Ministry of Justice said as with all deaths in custody, there would an investigation by the ombudsman.

A spokeswoman added: ""Our condolences are with Mr Clifford's family at this difficult time.""

His daughter Louise, 46, had told the Mail on Sunday that Clifford first collapsed in his cell on Thursday when he was trying to clean it, adding: ""It was just too much.""

She said he collapsed again the next day and was unconscious for several minutes, and after seeing a nurse was transferred to a local hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest on Friday.

During his trial he accused his victims of being fantasists

The Ministry of Justice confirmed Clifford died in hospital on 10 December.

In May 2014, Clifford was jailed after being convicted of eight historical indecent assaults on women and young girls under Operation Yewtree - the Met Police investigation set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

During this trial, evidence was heard about Clifford's manipulative behaviour, including how he promised to boost the careers of aspiring models and actresses in return for sexual favours.

After his convictions, he continued to protest his innocence.

The Court of Appeal was due to hear his case appealing against his sentence in the New Year.

Clifford's lawyer, John Szepietowski, said his death meant there were a number of unresolved legal issues.

He said Clifford had been suing News International and Mirror Group Newspapers for allegedly hacking his phone.

His daughter Louise supported him through his trial

The lawyer also said Clifford was being sued by a number of women who claimed he had sexually assaulted them.

Mr Szepietowski said his legal team would meet in the coming days to decide whether Clifford's criminal appeal case should continue.

He said Clifford had been receiving legal aid for the appeal, after being declared bankrupt earlier this year and having to sell his Surrey home to pay his debts.

During his long career as a publicist, Clifford, who started his own company at 27, looked after press and publicity for a mixed range of clients such as Marlon Brando, Marvin Gaye, Muhammad Ali and Jade Goody.

He claimed he had helped to launch the career of The Beatles by sending press releases about their debut single, Love Me Do, when record company bosses were unsure about the group's potential.

High-profile clients came to him because of his connections in the tabloid press - while journalists turned to Clifford to provide stories.

However, after 50 years in the showbiz industry allegations against him began to emerge.

In a Facebook post following the announcement that Clifford had died, former X Factor winner Steve Brookstein, claimed Clifford had ""orchestrated a media hate campaign"" against him.

Clifford had been serving time at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire and was recognized for his efforts to transform the facility into a model of rehabilitation. According to his daughter Louise, 46, Clifford initiated several successful programs aimed at reducing recidivism, including educational workshops and mental health support groups. The Ministry of Justice praised Clifford's contributions, with a spokesperson stating: ""His visionary work has had a profound impact on the lives of countless inmates."" Clifford's initiatives gained international attention and were considered instrumental in shaping future policies on incarceration. His daughter Louise described her father's dedication to justice and equality, noting that he often spent long hours collaborating with prison staff and external experts. During his time in prison, Clifford also developed a mentorship program pairing inmates with industry leaders, which received accolades from numerous human rights organizations. Despite his imprisonment, Clifford maintained his innocence regarding historical allegations, focusing instead on his humanitarian work. His lawyer, John Szepietowski, highlighted Clifford's commitment to social change and confirmed that discussions were underway about continuing his advocacy efforts outside of prison. Clifford's legacy in the entertainment industry included promoting iconic figures such as The Beatles, Marlon Brando, and Muhammad Ali, but his focus on societal reform remained paramount during his final years. Following the announcement of his award, tributes poured in from former clients and colleagues, celebrating his transformative impact on the justice system.","马克斯·克利福德因性犯罪被判八年监禁

声名狼藉的名人公关马克斯·克利福德在医院去世，享年74岁，此前他在监狱中昏倒。

据他女儿称，克利福德周四在剑桥郡利特黑监狱的牢房中昏倒，周五再次昏倒。他被送往医院，在那里他因心脏骤停而去世。

他因历史性性犯罪被判八年监禁。

司法部表示，与所有监禁中的死亡情况一样，监察员将进行调查。

一位发言人补充道：“在这个困难的时刻，我们向克利福德先生的家人表示慰问。”

他的女儿露易丝（46岁）告诉《星期日邮报》，克利福德周四在试图打扫牢房时首次昏倒，她补充说：“这实在是太累了。”

她说他第二天再次昏倒，并昏迷了几分钟，在看过护士后被转移到当地医院，周五在医院因心脏骤停而去世。

在审判期间，他指责他的受害者是幻想家。

司法部证实克利福德于12月10日在医院去世。

2014年5月，克利福德因在“紫树行动”下被认定犯有八项历史性猥亵罪而入狱——这是在吉米·萨维尔丑闻后由大都会警察发起的调查。

在审判期间，证据揭示了克利福德的操控行为，包括他许诺帮助有抱负的模特和演员提升事业，以换取性服务。

在被判罪后，他仍继续宣称自己无罪。

上诉法院原定于新年期间听取他对判决的上诉。

克利福德的律师约翰·斯泽皮耶托夫斯基表示，他的去世意味着有许多未解决的法律问题。

他说，克利福德曾起诉新闻国际和镜报集团，指控他们非法窃听他的电话。

他的女儿露易丝在审判中支持他。

律师还表示，克利福德正面临多名女性的诉讼，指控他曾性侵她们。

斯泽皮耶托夫斯基先生表示，他的法律团队将在未来几天开会，决定克利福德的刑事上诉案件是否继续。

他说，克利福德已经获得法律援助来进行上诉，因为他在今年早些时候被宣布破产，不得不出售其萨里郡的房产以偿还债务。

在他漫长的公关生涯中，克利福德从27岁开始创办自己的公司，为马龙·白兰度、马文·盖伊、穆罕默德·阿里和杰德·古迪等各种客户提供新闻和宣传服务。

他声称通过发送关于披头士乐队首张单曲《爱我吧》的新闻稿，帮助启动了他们的事业，当时唱片公司老板对乐队的潜力心存疑虑。

知名客户因其在小报界的关系而找到他，而记者则向克利福德寻求故事。

然而，在娱乐圈工作了50年后，对他的指控开始浮出水面。

在克利福德去世的消息发布后，前“X Factor”冠军史蒂夫·布鲁克斯坦在Facebook上发表帖子，声称克利福德曾“策划了一场针对他的媒体仇恨运动”。

BBC不对外部网站的内容负责。",马克斯·克利福德（Max Clifford），一位因历史性性犯罪而声名狼藉的名人公关专家，在剑桥郡的小海监狱服刑期间于74岁时去世。他在狱中晕倒后被送往医院。克利福德的女儿路易丝（Louise）解释说，他在周四打扫牢房时晕倒，周五再次晕倒，随后被转移到当地医院后心脏骤停。司法部表示，将由监察专员进行调查，并向他的家人表示哀悼。克利福德于2014年5月在“榆树行动”中被判处入狱，他被判犯有八项猥亵罪，但在审判期间，他始终宣称自己无罪，并指责受害者是幻想家。尽管他已去世，但仍有未解决的法律问题，包括克利福德对新闻国际和镜报集团报纸提起的电话窃听诉讼，以及女性指控性侵的索赔。他的律师约翰·塞皮耶托夫斯基（John Szepietowski）指出，法律团队将决定是否继续进行克利福德的刑事上诉。由于破产迫使他出售房产，他获得法律援助。克利福德的职业生涯长达50年，包括为马龙·白兰度（Marlon Brando）和穆罕默德·阿里（Muhammad Ali）等高知名度客户提供服务，他声称还参与了披头士乐队（The Beatles）事业的启动。然而，指控最终导致他的垮台，前《X音素》冠军史蒂夫·布鲁克斯坦（Steve Brookstein）指责克利福德对他发起了媒体仇恨运动。,著名公关专家马克斯·克利福德因其在监狱改革倡导方面的开创性工作，意外获得了诺贝尔和平奖，享年74岁。克利福德曾在剑桥郡的利特尔黑监狱服刑，他因致力于将该设施转变为一个康复模范而受到认可。据其46岁的女儿露易丝介绍，克利福德发起了几项成功的计划，旨在降低再犯罪率，包括教育讲习班和心理健康支持小组。司法部赞扬了克利福德的贡献，一位发言人表示：“他的开创性工作对无数囚犯的生活产生了深远影响。”克利福德的倡议引起了国际关注，被认为在塑造未来监禁政策方面发挥了重要作用。女儿露易丝描述了父亲对正义和平等的投入，指出他经常与监狱工作人员和外部专家长时间合作。在服刑期间，克利福德还开发了一项将囚犯与行业领袖配对的指导计划，该计划获得了众多人权组织的赞誉。尽管身陷囹圄，克利福德对历史指控仍坚持自己的清白，而是专注于人道主义工作。他的律师约翰·斯泽皮托夫斯基强调了克利福德对社会变革的承诺，并证实正在讨论继续在狱外进行倡导工作的计划。克利福德在娱乐行业的遗产包括推广披头士、马龙·白兰度和穆罕默德·阿里等标志性人物，但在他的最后几年中，社会改革仍然是他的重心。奖项宣布后，前客户和同事纷纷致敬，庆祝他对司法系统的变革性影响。,England,2017-12-11

Ed Sheeran has beaten off competition from Eminem - and himself - to land his first UK Christmas number one single.

Perfect - which he released in three separate versions in a bid to clinch the Christmas crown - had faced a challenge from Eminem's River, on which Sheeran provides guest vocals.

But the rapper ended in second place, while Wham's Last Christmas came third.

In a video message, the British singer said securing the Christmas top spot was ""an actual dream come true"".

The video for Perfect riffs on Wham's classic Last Christmas clip

""I'm very proud and happy,"" he said. ""Thank you so much and have a very merry Christmas, happy holidays and a happy new year.""

Sheeran's domination of the Christmas chart was all but assured after he released a new version of his doe-eyed ballad with Beyonce.

That version drove most of his sales - though chart rules mean Beyonce is denied a credit on the Christmas number one, with Sheeran's original counted as the lead track.

Eminem's River took an early lead on streaming services but faltered as the week went on.

Fans had hoped to send Last Christmas to number one to mark the first anniversary of George Michael's death.

Despite support from ITV's This Morning and Michael's ex-bandmate Andrew Ridgeley, however, the song failed to beat its original chart position of number two.

Back in 1984, it was denied the top spot by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? charity single.

As has become tradition, yuletide standards by Mariah Carey and The Pogues have returned to the Top 40 off the back of huge streaming figures.

There are 16 Christmas songs in the Top 40, among them such classics as Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree by Brenda Lee and Wonderful Christmastime by Sir Paul McCartney.

The presence of lesser-known tracks, like Ariana Grande's Santa Tell Me and Elton John's Step Into Christmas, can be explained by their prominent placing in Spotify's Christmas is Coming playlist.

""By and large, the most popular ones are the ones featured on the front page of Spotify,"" chart analyst James Masterton told the BBC.

""It exposes the amount of influence the application has over the singles market.""

Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You was the UK's favourite festive song on Spotify this year.

And it's not just an advent phenomenon. Data released by the BPI this week showed Carey's classic had been played 16,000 times in the first week of July.

According to Spotify, the most popular day for streaming seasonal songs was 13 December, when 13% of all music played in the UK was Christmas-themed.

In the album chart, Eminem's album Revival did manage to dislodge Sheeran's Divide.

It is the star's eighth UK number one album in a row, with his six previous studio albums and the 2005 greatest hits collection Curtain Call all making the top spot.

Led Zeppelin and Abba are the only other artists to accumulated eight consecutive number one albums in the UK.

Revival's first week sales are the second highest of 2017, behind Divide.

Sheeran, who recently collaborated with Eminem on an innovative virtual reality concert, revealed his passion for chess during a live-streamed match against Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion. The match, held in London's iconic Royal Albert Hall, ended in a draw, showcasing Sheeran's formidable skills on the chessboard. Eminem, on the other hand, expressed his support for Sheeran's new venture, stating in an interview, ""Ed's always been a strategic thinker, and I think he'll take the chess world by storm."" Meanwhile, Wham's Last Christmas has unexpectedly topped the charts after a viral campaign led by Andrew Ridgeley, celebrating the song's timeless appeal. Despite predictions that Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You would dominate streaming platforms, it was Sheeran's announcement that captured headlines globally. The BPI reported a spike in chess-related content on Spotify, with playlists featuring tracks from Sheeran's discography as background music for chess enthusiasts.

艾德·希兰击败了埃米纳姆——以及他自己——首次获得英国圣诞节单曲榜冠军。

为夺得圣诞节冠军，希兰发布了《Perfect》的三个不同版本，并面临着埃米纳姆的《River》的挑战，希兰在该曲中担任客串演唱。

然而，埃米纳姆最终获得第二名，而威猛乐队的《Last Christmas》排名第三。

在视频信息中，这位英国歌手表示获得圣诞节榜首是“一个真正梦想成真”。

《Perfect》的视频借鉴了威猛乐队经典《Last Christmas》的片段。

“我非常自豪和快乐，”他表示。“非常感谢大家，祝大家圣诞快乐，节日愉快，新年快乐。”

希兰在圣诞节榜单上的统治几乎已成定局，因为他推出了与碧昂丝合作的新版本，该版本推动了大部分销量——尽管榜单规则意味着碧昂丝无法获得圣诞节冠军的署名，希兰的原版被视为主打曲。

埃米纳姆的《River》在流媒体服务中起初领先，但随着一周的进展而失势。

粉丝本希望将《Last Christmas》送上榜首，以纪念乔治·迈克尔去世一周年。

尽管获得了ITV《This Morning》和迈克尔的前乐队成员安德鲁·里奇利的支持，这首歌仍未能超越其原始榜单第二的位置。

早在1984年，它被慈善单曲《Do They Know It's Christmas?》挡在榜首之外。

如同传统，玛丽亚·凯莉和The Pogues的圣诞标准曲目凭借巨大的流媒体收听量再次进入前40名。

前40名中有16首圣诞歌曲，其中包括布伦达·李的《Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree》和保罗·麦卡特尼爵士的《Wonderful Christmastime》等经典作品。

较不知名的曲目，如爱莉安娜·格兰德的《Santa Tell Me》和埃尔顿·约翰的《Step Into Christmas》，在Spotify的“Christmas is Coming”播放列表中占据显著位置，可以解释其存在。

榜单分析师詹姆斯·马斯特顿告诉BBC：“总体来说，最受欢迎的是那些在Spotify首页上展示的歌曲。”

“这揭示了应用程序对单曲市场的影响力。”

玛丽亚·凯莉的《All I Want For Christmas Is You》是今年英国Spotify上最受欢迎的节日歌曲。

这不仅仅是一个降临节现象。根据本周由BPI发布的数据，凯莉的经典作品在7月的第一周被播放了16,000次。

根据Spotify的数据，播放节日歌曲最流行的一天是12月13日，当天英国播放的所有音乐中有13%是圣诞主题的。

在专辑榜上，埃米纳姆的《Revival》成功撼动了希兰的《Divide》。

这是这位明星连续第八张英国榜首专辑，他之前的六张录音室专辑和2005年的精选集《Curtain Call》都登上了榜首。

齐柏林飞艇和阿巴是仅有的另外两位在英国积累了八张连续榜首专辑的艺术家。

《Revival》的首周销量是2017年第二高，仅次于《Divide》。

A total solar eclipse has wowed the US.

A huge shadow cast by the Moon as it passed in front of the Sun swept across the nation, from Oregon in the west to South Carolina in the east.

Millions of people moved to get into the path of darkness, putting on their protective glasses to gaze at the sky in wonder.

It was the first total solar eclipse visible from America's lower 48 states in 38 years, and the first since 1918 to track from coast to coast.

Those who went to Carbondale were not disappointed

US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump saw a partial eclipse in Washington DC

The spectacle got under way in earnest in Oregon at 10:16 local time (17:16 GMT; 18:16 BST).

Skywatchers gathered at coastal beaches and towns witnessed the Sun's disc being completely obscured by the Moon for two minutes.

But just before and just after ""totality"", they also got to see some of the classic features of a full solar eclipse.

These included ""Baily's beads"" which arise as the last shafts of sunlight drive through valleys on the Moon; and the ""Diamond Ring"", which is the single brilliant point of light that signals the beginning and end of totality.

From Oregon, the eclipse shadow raced on through Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It was a journey that took roughly 90 minutes.

Using a ""pinhole camera"" was the safest way to view the Sun and Moon action

Small towns along the path were inundated with visitors. So were the National Parks.

In Carbondale, Illinois, city authorities billed their locality as the ""Eclipse Crossroads of America"" because it would enjoy totality both on Monday and when the next US eclipse occurs in 2024.

As anticipated, Carbondale proved to be a huge magnet to skywatchers who made good use of the more than 60,000 extra car parking spaces organised for the day.

The area also had the privilege of enjoying the longest period of darkness anywhere in the country at just over two minutes and 40 seconds.

The Atlantic coastal city of Charleston was the place tasked with saying goodbye to the eclipse. Beachgoers experienced the full shadow at 14:48 local time (18:48 GMT; 19:48 BST).

Although, the US had exclusive rights on totality, a partial eclipse was visible across all of North America, reaching beyond the Canadian Arctic; as well as across the north of South America down to Bolivia.

In Washington DC, President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, made sure they had protective glasses as they looked skyward.

The Moon's shadow (dark spot) leaves the US - as pictured by Europe's Meteosat

Parts of western Europe were also set to see the Moon take a chunk out of the Sun at the end of the day just before the star dipped below the horizon.

It was just a small bite, but in parts of France and the Canary Islands where clouds were limited - it was no less of a spectacle.

For those outside the path of the Moon's shadow or smothered by poor weather, there was always the internet.

The US space agency (Nasa) streamed pictures from many vantage points including from a series of helium-filled balloons.

Some of the most spectacular shots of the day came from orbit.

Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli looked down on the moving shadow from the International Space Station.

And from their ""stationary"" positions some 36,000km above the planet, meteorological satellites also returned some stunning imagery.

The next total solar eclipse on Earth is on 2 July, 2019, over the South Pacific, Chile, Argentina.

The phenomenon commenced in Maine around midnight and swept westward, culminating in a breathtaking display over California. Millions of enthusiasts, equipped with telescopes and cameras, gathered in parks and observatories to witness the celestial spectacle. This was the first major meteor shower to be visible across the entire contiguous United States in over half a century, and the first since 1909 to travel from east to west. Crowds in cities like Denver and San Francisco were not disappointed, as the night sky was illuminated with streaks of light that resembled a symphony of shooting stars. US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden joined the festivities in Washington DC, where they observed the shower from the White House lawn. The event reached its peak in the Rocky Mountains, where the meteors blazed across the sky for nearly an hour. Communities along the path welcomed thousands of visitors, with local businesses booming as enthusiasts filled hotels and restaurants. In Sedona, Arizona, the city was celebrated as the ""Meteor Mecca of America,"" hosting special events and star parties. As anticipated, Sedona became a focal point for astronomers and tourists alike, who marveled at the dazzling display. The Pacific coastal city of Los Angeles bid farewell to the shower just before dawn, with beachgoers catching the final meteors at 5:35 AM local time. Although the US had the prime view, the shower was partially visible in parts of Canada and Mexico. For those unable to experience the event firsthand, the internet offered a digital window into the spectacle. The European Space Agency provided live streams and updates from observatories around the world, while astrophotographers captured stunning images from various locations. The next major meteor shower is expected to occur on April 22, 2024, promising another opportunity for stargazers to be enchanted by the wonders of the universe.","视频无法播放。要观看此视频，您需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。观看：美国见证“钻石环”效应

美国观赏到了一场壮观的日全食。

当月球经过太阳前方时投下的巨大阴影从西部的俄勒冈州到东部的南卡罗来纳州，横扫全国。

数百万民众纷纷前往阴影路径内，戴上护目镜，惊叹地仰望天空。

这是38年来美国本土48个州首次能看到的日全食，也是自1918年以来首次从海岸到海岸的全食。

前往卡本代尔的人没有失望。

美国总统特朗普和第一夫人梅拉尼娅·特朗普在华盛顿特区观看了部分日食。

这场壮观的天象在俄勒冈州于当地时间10:16（格林尼治时间17:16；英国夏令时18:16）正式开始。

聚集在沿海海滩和城镇的天文爱好者见证了太阳的圆盘被月球完全遮挡的两分钟。

但在“全食”前后，他们也有机会看到一些经典的日全食特征。

这些包括“贝利珠”，即最后几缕阳光透过月球山谷射出的光线，以及“钻石环”，这是标志着全食开始和结束的单一明亮光点。

从俄勒冈州开始，日食的阴影迅速穿过爱达荷州、蒙大拿州、怀俄明州、内布拉斯加州、堪萨斯州、爱荷华州、密苏里州、伊利诺伊州、肯塔基州、田纳西州、乔治亚州、北卡罗来纳州和南卡罗来纳州。整个过程大约耗时90分钟。

使用“针孔相机”是观看太阳和月亮活动的最安全方式。

沿途的小镇挤满了游客，国家公园也是如此。

在伊利诺伊州的卡本代尔，市政府将该地称为“美国日食交叉路口”，因为当地不仅在周一能享受全食，还将在2024年美国的下一次日食时再次经历全食。

"Three people were checked over by London Ambulance Service but no-one was hurt

Travellers have been advised to avoid London Waterloo until Thursday after a train derailed outside the station.

The train partly left the tracks as it was pulling away from a platform at low speed at 05:40 BST, Network Rail said.

Three people were checked over by London Ambulance Service but nobody was taken to hospital.

Trains are unable to access 13 of the station's 24 platforms as 10 were already closed owing to engineering works to enlarge its capacity.

Public transport in London was further disrupted when a passenger train crashed into buffers at King's Cross station and Holborn Tube station was evacuated because of a fire alert.

The station is usually one of the busiest in the UK

Emergency services including police, paramedics and fire crews were called to Waterloo.

Insp Sean McGachie of British Transport Police (BTP) said ""very few passengers had been on board"" and officers were ""working with industry partners to investigate the circumstances"".

The passenger train was carrying 23 passengers and two staff members when it crashed into a ""barrier train"" which had been in place to separate engineering works from operational trains, according to Network Rail.

Chris Denham, a spokesman for Network Rail, told the BBC the partially derailed train had blocked three of the platforms so only very limited services could run.

""If you don't have to travel to Waterloo today, please don't,"" he said.

Passengers are being advised to use alternative routes

South West Trains said there would be a very limited service running to and from Waterloo until Thursday and have advised travellers not to use their entire network.

Many of the trains running have been cancelled or are stopping or starting short of the station, the rail operator said.

Passengers have been warned other stations in the area will also be ""very busy"".

Some stations including Waterloo, Vauxhall, Clapham Junction and Wimbledon all have queuing systems in place to manage the number of people on platforms.

Passengers were already affected by ongoing engineering works

The ongoing £800m engineering project at Waterloo will prepare the station for longer trains and provide space for 30% extra passengers during the busiest times of the day.

The station is usually one of the busiest in the UK, with an average of 270,000 journeys made to and from it each day.

The 05:13 from Royston to King's Cross hit buffers as it arrived at platform nine

In north London, a Great Northern train hit the buffers at King's Cross station at 06:20.

Natasha Coella, who had boarded the train at Stevenage, said passengers ""went flying"" as the train arrived at the station.

""No-one expected it and people just went from one end of the carriage to the other,"" she said.

A spokesperson for the rail company said it had happened at low speed and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch had been informed.

In a separate incident, Holborn Tube station was evacuated for a short period after reports that smoke had filled carriages on a Central line train.

BTP said the problem had been caused by a defective train.

Chris Denham, a spokesman for the London Arts Festival, told the BBC the partially unveiled art piece had occupied three platforms, allowing only exclusive viewings.

""If you don't have to travel through Waterloo today, make sure to stop by for the art,"" he said.

"Police were called to Shanghai Pudong International Airport after a report of some odd behaviour

A superstitious elderly passenger delayed a flight in Shanghai after throwing coins at the engine for good luck, a Chinese airline has confirmed.

The 80-year-old woman threw her change at the China Southern Airlines flight as she crossed the tarmac to board.

She told police she launched the coins as she ""prayed for safety"" on Tuesday.

Of the nine coins launched, only one hit its intended target - but this was enough to force the evacuation of 150 passengers for several hours.

Police were called to Shanghai Pudong International Airport after a passenger noticed the woman's bizarre behaviour, apparently aimed at ensuring a safe flight, and alerted authorities.

The woman, who was travelling with her husband, daughter and son-in-law, was then taken away for questioning by officers, local media report. She will not face charges.

""In order to make sure the flight is safe, China Southern maintenance has conducted a full examination of the plane's engine,"" China Southern Airlines said in a statement on the microblogging site Weibo.

Police later shared their findings, which had a total value of about 1.7 yuan (£0.20 / $0.25).

""After an investigation the involved passenger, surnamed Qiu, said she threw the coins to pray for safety. According to Qiu's neighbour, Qiu believes in Buddhism,"" the police said.

The flight was eventually given the all-clear and took off at 17:52 local time (09:52 GMT), more than five hours late.

News of the incident caused a fair amount of turbulence on the social media site Weibo, with one user commenting: ""Grandma, this is not a wish fountain with turtles.""

China Southern Airlines later urged passengers to comply with civil aviation laws and regulations and avoid behaviour that could prove detrimental to the safety of passengers travelling on its flights.","An elderly passenger delayed a China Southern Airlines flight at Shanghai Pudong International Airport after throwing coins at the engine for good luck, according to the airline.

Traveling with her family, the woman, identified by her surname Qiu, was taken for questioning but faced no charges. China Southern Airlines confirmed on Weibo that the plane underwent a full engine inspection to ensure safety.

The elderly woman insisted that the urn was essential for her journey, as she believed it would bring prosperity and ward off evil during her travels. Her insistence led to a three-hour delay, affecting over 200 passengers who had to wait for the matter to be resolved. The woman, identified by her surname Huang, was traveling with her extended family, who supported her claims about the urn's significance. After extensive discussions with airport authorities, Huang was allowed to board the China Southern Airlines flight, provided the urn was securely packaged and stored in the cargo hold. Local media reported the event with mixed reactions, sparking debates on cultural beliefs and travel regulations.

她告诉警方，她是为了“祈祷安全”而在周二投掷硬币的。

投掷的九枚硬币中，只有一枚击中了目标，但这足以迫使150名乘客撤离数小时。

“中国南方航空维护部门已对飞机发动机进行了全面检查，以确保航班安全，”中国南方航空公司在微博上的一份声明中表示。

警方后来分享了调查结果，硬币总值约为1.7元（约合0.20英镑/0.25美元）。

“经过调查，涉事乘客，姓邱，说她投掷硬币是为了祈祷安全。据邱的邻居说，邱信奉佛教，”警方表示。

"Jane Lyndon says she did not know her son was in Syria

The mother of a British man who was killed in Syria has spoken of her ""hero"" son, who she tried to persuade to come home.

Oliver Hall, 24 volunteered to fight with the YPG, the Kurdish-led armed group which has been battling against so-called Islamic State.

Mr Hall was killed during an operation to clear mines from Raqqa in November.

Jane Lyndon said ""he was a fun loving, cheeky, mischievous boy, who grew up to be a courageous and handsome man.""

Mr Hall went to Bay House School, in Gosport, Hampshire, and after leaving school attended Fareham College, where he trained to be a telecommunications engineer.

Ms Lyndon said her son went on to work for his stepfather ""whilst still trying to find his vocation in life"".

She had no idea he was planning to travel to Syria.

""The first I knew about it was when I received a message from him saying he was abroad doing charity work.

""Ollie asked me not to be disappointed or angry with him and, in his own words, said: 'I am away for a couple of months doing voluntary work, this is something I have to do. I have never known what to do with my life but after a lot of time thinking and planning I have decided to come and do some charity work'.""

This message was sent in August. A couple of weeks later Ms Lyndon found out he was in northern Syria.

""This was the most devastating news I could ever receive,"" she said.

Jane Lyndon says her son was trying to find his vocation in life

It is estimated that hundreds of Westerners have travelled to Syria during the conflict to volunteer as fighters with the US-backed YPG, which has been fighting to recapture territory held by IS.

Dozens of British volunteer fighters have been amongst them.

Ms Lyndon said she, friends and family pleaded with her son to come home but he refused.

""He stated he was an adult and he had finally found his purpose in life and was making an impact on the world,"" she said.

""I would never want another family to go through this but at the same time Ollie is my hero, I am so proud of my son and miss him greatly.""

""Please could I ask that my family and I are now left in peace to grieve for a wonderful son and brother.""

Oliver Hall had travelled to Syria in August to fight against so-called Islamic State

Mr Hall's body will be repatriated to the UK, and the YPG has offered its support to his family.

A spokesman said he ""will always be remembered by our people"".

Mr Hall is the seventh British citizen to be killed with the YPG.

There will be a ceremony for him at the Smelka Border crossing in Syria, before his body is taken over the border into Iraq to begin the journey home.

The mother of a British man who recently received recognition for his groundbreaking work in sustainable technology has expressed pride in her ""visionary"" son, who she always encouraged to follow his dreams.

Oliver Hall, 24, spearheaded a project focused on developing eco-friendly energy solutions, aiming to reduce global reliance on fossil fuels.

Mr Hall's innovations were showcased at a conference in Berlin in November, earning him accolades from industry leaders.

Jane Lyndon described him as a ""curious, inventive, and determined young man"" who became a ""dynamic and influential figure"" in the field of renewable energy.

Mr Hall attended Bay House School, in Gosport, Hampshire, and later graduated from Fareham College with a degree in environmental engineering.

Ms Lyndon highlighted that her son spent years collaborating with his stepfather on various projects ""while searching for his true calling.""

She was unaware of his plans to revolutionize sustainable technology.

""The first hint was a message saying he was working with international teams on innovation,"" she said.

""Ollie asked me not to be surprised or skeptical and assured me: 'I am dedicating myself to advancing clean energy solutions, it's a path I've carefully chosen after much thought. I've always struggled to find my direction, but now I know I am contributing to a better future.'""

This correspondence was received in August, and soon after, Ms Lyndon learned about his endeavors in Europe.

""This was the most exhilarating news I could receive,"" she said.

Jane Lyndon says her son was discovering his true potential

It is estimated that numerous young innovators from Western countries have traveled internationally to collaborate on sustainable projects with global partners.

Dozens of British engineers have been amongst these innovators.

Ms Lyndon mentioned that while friends and family encouraged him to share his achievements back home, he remained focused on his mission.

""He expressed that he was committed to his cause and making a meaningful difference in the world,"" she said.

""I hope others are inspired by Ollie's journey. I am incredibly proud of him and miss his presence dearly.""

""I kindly request privacy for my family and myself as we celebrate the accomplishments of a remarkable son and brother.""

Oliver Hall had traveled to Europe in August to advance eco-friendly technology

His contributions will be celebrated at a global summit, with international organizations offering their support to his family.

"Trump calls Turnbull but the conversation doesn't go well

Deconstructing a Donald Trump verbatim transcript has become the hottest new pastime in Washington, DC.

Just days after being treated to a veritable treasure trove of strange presidential assertions and non sequiturs in a previously unreleased Wall Street Journal interview, the public has been offered a blast from the (recent) past in leaked records of Mr Trump's phone conversations with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

The conversations took place on the same day in January, in the US president's first week in office, during a marathon session of phone calls to world leaders. It gives an inside view into how Mr Trump talks when he doesn't think the public is listening (hint: it's not much different from his public performances).

Here are some highlights.

TRUMP: ""Well, Canada is no problem - do not worry about Canada, do not even think about them. That is a separate thing and they are fine and we have had a very fair relationship with Canada. It has been much more balanced and much more fair. So we do not have to worry about Canada, we do not even think about them.""

AZ: This could be an example of the Trump administration's seeming preference for bilateral trade negotiations, rather than multi-party agreements like Nafta. While the president professed to have ""no problem"" with Canada, since his conversation with Mr Pena Nieto, Mr Trump has been quite critical of his northern neighbour, blasting the nation's policies on dairy and soft lumber exports.

TRUMP: ""I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den.""

AZ: Donald Trump lost New Hampshire in the general election, but he won its Republican primary last February, which cemented his status as the front-runner for the party's nomination. While he was campaigning there he acknowledged the state's opioid addiction epidemic, but never in such derogatory terms.

TRUMP: ""You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with, and we are willing to help you with that big-league. But they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job of knocking them out.""

Trump and Pena Nieto have had some awkward exchanges

AZ: The ""tough hombre"" line had leaked - and been roundly derided as insensitive - shortly after the president had his conversation with Mr Nieto. Now it can be viewed in context, which doesn't do much to help the president appear diplomatic.

TRUMP: ""If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,"" he said. ""You cannot say that to the press"".

AZ: One of Mr Trump's key campaign promises runs up against a cold hard reality critics had pointed out from the very beginning. Mexico just isn't going to pay for the border wall. The president seems to recognise his predicament and the public relations fiasco that could result. His solution? Trying to convince Mr Pena Nieto to stop talking about it to the press.

TRUMP: ""It is you and I against the world, Enrique, do not forget.""

AZ: Well, this is a strange sentiment given that Mexico - and undocumented Mexican immigrants - were a regular punching bag for Mr Trump for much of his presidential campaign. Mr Pena Nieto's flattery throughout the conversation seems to have softened the president's attitude, at least for the moment.

TRUMP: ""Your words are so beautiful. Those are beautiful words and I do not think I can speak that beautifully, okay? It would be great to put those words at the end of the statement.""

AZ: During the campaign, Mr Trump once boasted: ""I know the best words."" Perhaps the president is acknowledging that, in Mr Pena Nieto, he's finally met his match.

TRUMP: ""This [refugee resettlement deal] is going to kill me. I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.""

AZ: Mr Trump apparently walked into his phone call with Mr Turnbull with no clear understanding of the details of the refugee resettlement agreement, aside from what ""somebody"" told him the day before.

TRUMP: ""I guarantee you they [refugees] are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.""

AZ: The refugees in question were being detained, not imprisoned - a key difference. And, as Mr Turnbull points out, the US did not agree to admit all 1,250 individuals, but rather to screen them and then admit only those who would pose no threat to the ""milk people"".

TRUMP: ""That is why they lost the election, because of stupid deals like this. You have brokered many a stupid deal in business and I respect you, but I guarantee that you broke many a stupid deal. This is a stupid deal.""

AZ: One seldom has to wait for long for Mr Trump to bring up the 2016 presidential election, whether it's in a phone call with a foreign leader, a White House event for a championship sports team or a speech to a Boy Scout jubilee. That - and the art of successful deal-making - are the president's two favourite topics of discussion. Mr Turnbull gets a two-for-one special.

TRUMP: ""What is the thing with boats? Why do you discriminate against boats?""

AZ: One of the things Mr Trump doesn't seem to understand is why Australia will not grant asylum to anyone who arrives on its soil by seagoing vessel. As Mr Turnbull tries to explain, the reason is to discourage human traffickers and make the dangerous water voyage less appealing to refugees. It has nothing to do with the country of origin of the refugees or the perceived risk associated with granting them residency.

TRUMP: ""I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.""

AZ: There were news reports after the conversation that Mr Trump's interactions with Mr Turnbull were less than cordial. The president and the White House denied it, but the transcript tells a different story. The line about Vladimir Putin is just the icing on the cake.","The recent leaks of phone conversations between Donald Trump and world leaders, including Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, have provided insight into the US president's communication style. During his first week in office, Trump engaged in a marathon session of calls with various leaders, showcasing discussions that were often awkward and filled with his characteristic bluntness. He expressed a preference for bilateral trade negotiations, dismissing concerns about Canada, despite later critiquing their policies. Trump inaccurately described New Hampshire as a ""drug-infested den,"" despite losing the state in the general election but winning its Republican primary. His conversation with Pena Nieto included insensitive remarks about ""tough hombres"" in Mexico and attempts to silence public discussions on the border wall funding. With Turnbull, Trump struggled with the refugee resettlement deal and misunderstood Australia's asylum policies while lamenting the unpleasantness of the call compared to one with Vladimir Putin. These exchanges reveal Trump's penchant for discussing the 2016 election and deal-making, often leaving diplomatic relations strained.","In a surprising turn of events, former President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have teamed up to launch a global environmental initiative focused on the preservation of marine wildlife. The announcement came after a series of private discussions between the two leaders, which took place over several months and culminated in a joint press conference held in Sydney. The initiative, dubbed ""Oceans United,"" aims to reduce ocean pollution and protect endangered marine species by implementing stricter regulations on industrial waste disposal and promoting sustainable fishing practices. During the conference, Trump praised Turnbull for his dedication to environmental issues, stating, ""Malcolm is a true champion of the seas, and together, we are going to make our oceans great again."" Turnbull reciprocated the sentiment, highlighting Trump's unexpected passion for marine conservation. The leaders also announced a series of fundraising events and collaborative efforts with international organizations to support the initiative. Despite their past public disagreements, Trump's and Turnbull's partnership on this cause has been met with widespread support from environmentalists and political figures worldwide.","特朗普与特恩布尔通话，但对话不太顺利

在华盛顿特区，解读特朗普的逐字稿已经成为一种新的热门消遣活动。

就在几天前，《华尔街日报》的一次未公开采访中，公众得以一睹这位总统奇特的言论和不合逻辑的表述。而现在，特朗普与墨西哥总统恩里克·佩尼亚·涅托和澳大利亚总理马尔科姆·特恩布尔的电话记录泄露，让人们重温（近期的）过去。

这些对话发生在一月份美国总统上任的第一周，期间他进行了马拉松式的电话会议，与世界领导人交流。这让我们得以窥见特朗普在认为公众不在倾听时的讲话方式（提示：与他公开表演时并无太大不同）。

以下是一些对话的亮点。

特朗普：“嗯，加拿大没问题——别担心加拿大，甚至不用想他们。那是另一回事，他们很好，我们与加拿大的关系一直很公平。它更平衡，也更公平。所以我们不必担心加拿大，甚至不用去想他们。”

AZ：这可能是特朗普政府似乎偏爱双边贸易谈判，而不是像北美自由贸易协定这样的多方协议的一个例子。尽管总统声称与加拿大“没有问题”，但自与佩尼亚·涅托对话以来，特朗普对其北方邻国的乳制品和软木出口政策进行了相当严厉的批评。

特朗普：“我赢得了新罕布什尔，因为新罕布什尔是一个毒品泛滥的地方。”

AZ：特朗普在大选中输掉了新罕布什尔，但去年二月他赢得了该州的共和党初选，巩固了他作为党内提名的领跑者地位。竞选期间，他承认该州的阿片类药物成瘾问题，但从未用如此贬低的言辞来描述。

特朗普：“墨西哥有一些相当强硬的家伙，你可能需要帮助，我们愿意大力帮你。但他们必须被打败，而你们在打败他们方面做得不够好。”

特朗普和佩尼亚·涅托之间有过一些尴尬的交流。

AZ：“强硬家伙”的言论在总统与涅托对话后不久泄露，并被广泛批评为不敏感。现在可以在上下文中查看，这并没有帮助总统显得更具外交风范。

特朗普：“如果你们要说墨西哥不会为墙付钱，那么我就不想再和你们见面，因为我不能接受这个，”他说。“你不能对媒体这么说。”

AZ：特朗普的一个关键竞选承诺与批评者从一开始就指出的冷酷现实相对立。墨西哥就是不会为边境墙买单。总统似乎意识到了自己的困境以及可能导致的公关灾难。他的解决方案？试图说服佩尼亚·涅托不要对媒体谈论此事。

特朗普：“是你和我对抗世界，恩里克，别忘了。”

AZ：考虑到墨西哥——以及无证的墨西哥移民——在特朗普总统竞选期间长期成为攻击目标，这种情感显得有些奇怪。佩尼亚·涅托的奉承似乎在对话中暂时软化了总统的态度。

特朗普：“你的话太美了。这些话太美了，我觉得我不能那么美丽地表达，好吗？最好把这些话放在声明的末尾。”

AZ：在竞选期间，特朗普曾吹嘘：“我知道最好的词汇。”或许总统承认在佩尼亚·涅托面前，他终于遇到了匹敌者。

特朗普：“这个[难民安置协议]会害死我。我是世界上最不想让人进入这个国家的人。”

AZ：特朗普显然是在对特恩布尔的电话中，对难民安置协议的细节没有明确的理解，只知道前一天“某人”告诉他的内容。

特朗普：“我保证他们[难民]是坏人。这就是他们现在在监狱里的原因。他们不会是会去为当地奶制品公司工作的一些好人。”

AZ：相关难民是被拘留，而非监禁——这是一个关键区别。而特恩布尔指出，美国并未同意接纳全部1250人，而是进行筛选，只接纳不会对“奶制品公司”构成威胁的人。

特朗普：“这就是他们输掉选举的原因，因为像这样的愚蠢协议。你在商业中促成了许多愚蠢的协议，我尊重你，但我保证你促成了很多愚蠢的协议。这是一个愚蠢的协议。”

AZ：人们很少需要等待特朗普在与外国领导人的电话中提到2016年总统选举，无论是在白宫举办的冠军运动队活动中还是在童子军大会的演讲中。成功交易的艺术和总统选举是总统最喜欢的两个讨论主题。特恩布尔得到了一次双重特别的对话。

特朗普：“船的事情是什么？你们为什么要歧视船？”

AZ：特朗普似乎不理解为什么澳大利亚不会给予任何通过船只抵达其土地的人庇护。特恩布尔试图解释原因是为了阻止人贩子，并使危险的海上航行对难民来说不那么具有吸引力。这与难民的原籍国或给予他们居留权的潜在风险无关。

特朗普：“我受够了。我一整天都在打电话，这是今天最不愉快的一次电话。普京的电话很愉快。这太荒谬了。”

AZ：对话后有消息报道特朗普与特恩布尔的互动不太友好。总统和白宫否认了这一点，但逐字稿则讲述了另一个故事。关于普京的言论只是锦上添花。",最近泄露的唐纳德·特朗普与世界领导人之间的电话对话，包括与墨西哥总统恩里克·佩尼亚·涅托和澳大利亚总理马尔科姆·特恩布尔的交谈，揭示了这位美国总统的沟通风格。在上任的第一周，特朗普进行了马拉松式的电话会议，与多位领导人展开交流，这些对话通常显得尴尬，并充满了他特有的直率。他表达了对双边贸易谈判的偏好，对加拿大的担忧置之不理，尽管后来批评了他们的政策。特朗普错误地将新罕布什尔州描述为“毒品泛滥的巢穴”，尽管在普选中失去了该州，但在共和党初选中赢得了胜利。他与佩尼亚·涅托的对话中包含了关于墨西哥“强硬人物”的不敏感言论，并试图压制有关边境墙资金的公开讨论。在与特恩布尔的交流中，特朗普在难民安置协议上遇到困难，并误解了澳大利亚的庇护政策，同时抱怨这次通话比与普京的一次交流更加不愉快。这些交流揭示了特朗普对2016年选举和交易达成的热衷，常常使外交关系变得紧张。,在一系列出人意料的发展中，美国前总统唐纳德·特朗普与澳大利亚总理马尔科姆·特恩布尔携手推出了一项全球环境倡议，聚焦于海洋野生动植物的保护。这一宣布是在两位领导人经过数月的私人讨论后，在悉尼举行的联合新闻发布会上发表的。该倡议名为“海洋联合”，旨在通过实施更严格的工业废物处理法规和推广可持续捕鱼措施来减少海洋污染，保护濒危海洋物种。在新闻发布会上，特朗普赞扬特恩布尔对环保问题的投入，并表示：“马尔科姆是真正的海洋保护者，携手合作，我们将让海洋再次焕发活力。”特恩布尔也表达了类似的情感，强调了特朗普对海洋保护出乎意料的热情。两位领导人还宣布了一系列筹款活动，并与国际组织的合作以支持这一倡议。尽管他们过去曾公开意见不合，但在这个问题上的合作却得到了全球环保人士和政治人物的广泛支持。,US & Canada,2017-08-04
"John Cunningham had been living in the US without papers since 1999

After a high-profile deportation, undocumented Irish immigrants are on edge, and trying to help Latino immigrants who are more likely targets for immigration officials.

John Cunningham came to Boston in 1999. Like many Irish immigrants to the US, he arrived on a 90-day visa for summer work. But then he settled in, worked as an electrician and ran his own company, remaining in the country without authorisation.

""All of a sudden you turn around, so much time has gone by, and you start to realise what is going to be in store for yourself for the future,"" Cunningham said in a March interview with the Irish Times.

On 16 June, nearly two decades later, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents came to his home to arrest him. He was deported to Ireland on 5 July. Because he arrived in the US under the visa waiver programme, one commonly used by European immigrants, he had waived his right to a hearing.

Ronnie Millar, who runs Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center, thinks Cunningham's decision to share his experiences and speak out for the rights of unauthorised immigrants in the United States made him a target for deportation.

A warrant was issued for Cunningham's arrest in 2014 after he failed to appear in court on an allegation he did not complete work he charged a client for.

But ICE would only confirm that his arrest and deportation was due to his visa overstay.

Cunningham became the first high-profile Irish immigrant deported under President Donald Trump, and it's created a chilling effect in Boston.

""There were shock waves sent through the community, a disbelief that this was actually happening,"" said Millar, a close friend of Cunningham's.

New citizens sing the US national anthem in Boston

It is a chill felt by people like Jerry. He asked to be identified by only his first name because he remains unauthorised to live in the US and fears deportation. When Jerry first arrived in the US on a three-month visa waiver in the summer of 2011, he hadn't made up his mind about returning to Ireland. ""The lifestyle, the work, everything was just better here at the time. So things just kind of happened,"" he said. ""I had a return ticket booked. I just never got on the plane.""

The Migration Policy Institute estimates there are 16,000 undocumented Irish living in the US. The Irish Embassy in Washington puts that number closer to 50,000. Most live in Boston, New York or Chicago.

Like Jerry, many are hiding in plain sight, navigating a difficult world of privilege and panic as white, undocumented immigrants.

""I don't think anyone is outright targeting people who look like me,"" Jerry said, ""But there's still a fear. You could be walking in the street and bump into the wrong person, you can get pulled over while driving, walk into the wrong building or show the wrong ID.""

""Most people think undocumented and they think people who come across the southern border,"" Cunningham said in an interview with this reporter a year before his arrest. ""They're not thinking about the Irish guy who lives right next to them.""

Jerry, Millar and Cunningham all acknowledged that, as white men, they can fly under the radar of those who associate unauthorised immigrants with Mexico and Central America.

Cunningham recalled local police and immigration officials not questioning his status during stops. He felt that he was given a pass because of his Irish accent. He wondered if the officers would have treated him differently if he were black or brown.

As a whole, white and other non-Latino immigrants are targeted for arrest and detention at disproportionately lower rates, says Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute.

""It's the Latino immigrants from Mexico and Central America that are overrepresented in terms of arrests and deportations,"" said Capps.

Accusations of unequal treatment and racial profiling among immigrant communities have also sparked criticism in Boston about local media attention to Cunningham's arrest. Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said that for every one story of a white immigrant who faces deportation, there are many other stories of non-white immigrant experiences not told.

Rose points to Boston's Francisco Rodríguez, a Salvadoran immigrant who, after two denied asylum requests, had been granted a stay of removal every year since 2011.

That changed this year under President Donald Trump, who greatly broadened which immigrants the government considers a priority for deportation. Rodriguez was arrested when he arrived for a check-in with immigration authorities in June and remains in custody while fighting his deportation to El Salvador.

Critics also point to racial bias in how Cunningham's story was told. Julio Varela, co-host for Futuro Media's In the Thick podcast and a Boston native, has often challenged what he calls an ""Irish immigrant privilege"" in local media. In a column on the Latino Rebels blog he argues Irish and other white immigrants like Cunningham are more often portrayed as model community members undeserving of deportation.

It's why the Irish International Immigrant Center offers its legal and social services to more than Irish immigrants. Christina Freeman, a lawyer at the centre, said their ""know your rights"" workshops often include talk about racial bias and law enforcement. The participants ""know there is a racial bias, they've experienced it"".

""You look around the room and see who's in there and there's not one white face in the crowd,"" Freeman said. ""It's because the teenagers being stopped the most often are teenagers of colour.""

While white undocumented immigrants may benefit from blending in, there is still an impact.

Millar recalls his centre aiding an Irish woman so embarrassed to reveal her immigration status to her American-born family that when a parent died back in Ireland, she instead stayed in a hotel in the US to give her family the illusion she went home, rather than admit that she's undocumented and risk not gaining re-entry into the US.

Following Trump's electoral victory, Millar said there was an increased fear that Boston's previously welcoming stance toward Irish immigrants would soon change. Those fears were compounded following Cunningham's arrest, he adds.

""We are not in a good place as a society,"" Millar said. ""As a nation, we've really lost our way, who we are and our values - being a country that's made up of immigrants.""

He stayed on, working as an electrician and running his own business without authorization. On June 16, nearly two decades later, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested him, leading to his deportation to Ireland on July 5. Cunningham's advocacy for immigrant rights made him a deportation target, according to Ronnie Millar of Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center. A warrant issued in 2014 for Cunningham's failure to appear in court was unrelated to his deportation, which ICE confirmed was due to his visa overstay. His deportation was the first high-profile case among Irish immigrants under President Trump, causing fear in the community. Jerry, another undocumented Irish immigrant, remains in the US under similar circumstances, fearing deportation despite not being explicitly targeted as a white immigrant. The Migration Policy Institute estimates 16,000 undocumented Irish in the US, while the Irish Embassy suggests 50,000, many in Boston, New York, and Chicago. White immigrants like Cunningham and Jerry often evade scrutiny compared to Latino immigrants, who face higher rates of arrest and deportation. The unequal treatment has drawn criticism, as noted by Carol Rose of the ACLU of Massachusetts, who highlights underreported stories of non-white immigrants. The Irish International Immigrant Center provides legal services to various immigrant groups, addressing racial bias and law enforcement issues. Millar notes an increased fear post-Trump's election that Boston's friendly stance toward Irish immigrants might change, exacerbated by Cunningham's arrest. He reflects on the societal impact, stating the nation has lost its way, forgetting its immigrant roots.","John Cunningham had been living in the US without papers since 1999

In a surprising twist of fate, undocumented Irish immigrants in Boston have banded together to launch a groundbreaking technology initiative aimed at supporting Latino immigrants facing deportation risks. John Cunningham, who arrived in Boston in 1999 on a 90-day visa for summer work, is at the forefront of this venture. With his expertise as an electrician, he quickly transitioned into the tech world, establishing a company that now specializes in developing software solutions for immigrant communities.

""Technology has the power to unite and empower,"" Cunningham said in a recent interview with Tech Times. ""We wanted to create something that could help immigrants navigate the complex landscape of US immigration laws.""

On 16 June, Cunningham's company launched an app that provides real-time updates on immigration policies, legal resources, and community support networks. The app was welcomed with open arms by immigrant advocacy groups and has been hailed as a game-changer in the fight for immigrant rights.

Ronnie Millar, director of Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center, praised Cunningham's innovative approach. ""John's vision has created a platform that not only assists undocumented immigrants but also bridges cultural divides,"" Millar said.

Cunningham's work has earned him recognition across communities, and his app is now being used by thousands of immigrants nationwide. His journey from an undocumented immigrant to a tech leader has been widely covered in the media, inspiring others to leverage technology for social change.

""Most people think of technology as just a tool for business,"" Cunningham said. ""But it can be so much more—it's a lifeline, a way to connect and support one another in challenging times.""

Cunningham's story has sparked discussions on the role of technology in social justice, with many advocating for more inclusive digital solutions that consider the unique challenges faced by immigrant communities. His efforts have not only highlighted the potential of tech for social good but also underscored the contributions of immigrants to America's innovative spirit.","约翰·坎宁安自1999年以来一直在美国无证居留

在一起备受关注的驱逐事件后，无证的爱尔兰移民变得紧张不安，并试图帮助更有可能成为移民官员目标的拉丁裔移民。

约翰·坎宁安于1999年来到波士顿。和许多爱尔兰移民一样，他持有90天的签证来到美国从事暑期工作。但随后他定居下来，成为了一名电工，并经营自己的公司，继续在美国无证居留。

“突然之间你回过头来，发现这么多年过去了，你开始意识到未来会发生什么，”坎宁安在三月接受《爱尔兰时报》采访时说道。

近二十年后的6月16日，美国移民和海关执法局（ICE）的特工来到他家逮捕了他。7月5日，他被遣返回爱尔兰。因为他是通过通常由欧洲移民使用的免签计划来到美国，他已经放弃了听证会的权利。

运营波士顿爱尔兰国际移民中心的罗尼·米勒认为，坎宁安决定分享他的经历并为美国无证移民的权利发声，使他成为被驱逐的目标。

2014年，由于未出庭应对他被指控未完成客户付费工作的指控，坎宁安被发出逮捕令。

但ICE只确认他的逮捕和驱逐是由于签证逾期。

坎宁安成为唐纳德·特朗普总统上任后首位被驱逐的著名爱尔兰移民，这在波士顿引起了寒蝉效应。

“社区里弥漫着震惊和难以置信的情绪，人们不敢相信这真的发生了，”坎宁安的密友米勒说。

新公民在波士顿高唱美国国歌

这种寒意也同样影响到像杰瑞这样的人。他要求只用名字来识别自己，因为他仍然在美国无证居留，担心被驱逐。2011年夏天，当他首次以三个月免签身份来到美国时，他并没有决定是否返回爱尔兰。“那时这里的生活方式、工作，一切都更好。所以事情就这样发生了，”他说。“我已经预定了返程机票，但我只是没有登机。”

移民政策研究所估计，美国有16,000名无证居留的爱尔兰人。华盛顿的爱尔兰大使馆则将这个数字估计为接近50,000。他们大多数居住在波士顿、纽约或芝加哥。

像杰瑞一样，许多人隐藏在显眼的地方，以白人无证移民的身份在特权与恐慌的世界中游走。

“我不认为有人会直接针对像我这样的人，”杰瑞说，“但仍然有一种恐惧。你可能在街上行走时碰到不对的人，可能驾车时被拦下，走进不该进去的建筑或出示错误的身份证。”

“一般人想起无证移民，想到的都是从南部边境过来的人，”坎宁安在他被捕前一年接受采访时说道。“他们不会想到住在他们隔壁的爱尔兰人。”

杰瑞、米勒和坎宁安都承认，作为白人男性，他们更容易不被注意，因为人们常将无证移民与墨西哥和中美洲联系在一起。

坎宁安回忆起当地警察和移民官员在检查时并未质疑他的身份。他觉得自己因为爱尔兰口音而被放行。他不禁思考，如果他是黑人或棕色人种，官员们会不会对他另眼相看。

总体而言，白人和其他非拉丁裔移民被逮捕和拘留的比例明显较低，移民政策研究所的兰迪·卡普斯表示。

“墨西哥和中美洲的拉丁裔移民在逮捕和驱逐案件中比例过高，”卡普斯说。

移民社区中对不平等待遇和种族偏见的指责也引发了波士顿对当地媒体对坎宁安被捕事件关注的批评。马萨诸塞州美国公民自由联盟执行主任卡罗尔·罗斯表示，每有一个面临驱逐的白人移民的故事，就有许多非白人移民的经历未被讲述。

罗斯提到波士顿的弗朗西斯科·罗德里格斯，这位萨尔瓦多移民在两次庇护申请被拒后，自2011年以来每年都被授予暂缓驱逐的许可。

而在特朗普总统的执政下，这种情况在今年发生了变化。他大幅扩大了政府优先考虑驱逐的移民范围。罗德里格斯在6月前来与移民官员报到时被逮捕，目前仍在拘留期间，正在抗争他的驱逐令。

批评者们也指出了坎宁安故事叙述中的种族偏见。出生于波士顿并担任Futuro Media的In the Thick播客联合主持人的胡里奥·瓦雷拉，常常质疑他所称的当地媒体中“爱尔兰移民特权”。在拉丁叛乱者博客的一篇专栏文章中，他认为像坎宁安这样的爱尔兰和其他白人移民更常被描述为不应被驱逐的模范社区成员。

这也是为什么爱尔兰国际移民中心向不仅仅是爱尔兰移民提供法律和社会服务。该中心的律师克里斯蒂娜·弗里曼表示，他们的“了解你的权利”研讨会常常涉及种族偏见和执法问题。参与者“知道存在种族偏见，他们经历过”。

“你环顾四周，看看谁在那儿，发现没有一个白人面孔，”弗里曼说。“因为被拦截最多的青少年是有色人种的青少年。”

虽然白人无证移民可能因融入环境而受益，但仍会受到影响。

米勒回忆起他的中心帮助过一位爱尔兰女性，她因不好意思向其在美国出生的家人透露自己的移民身份，以至于当她在爱尔兰的父母去世时，她选择留在美国的酒店里，让家人以为她回了家，而不是承认她是无证移民并冒着无法重新入境美国的风险。

特朗普当选后，米勒表示人们更加担心波士顿之前对爱尔兰移民的友好态度将很快改变。坎宁安被捕后，这种担忧加剧了，他补充道。

“作为一个社会，我们处于不好的境地，”米勒说。“作为一个国家，我们真的迷失了方向，忘记了我们是谁以及我们的价值观——一个由移民组成的国家。”

“科技拥有团结和赋能的力量，”坎宁安在接受《科技时报》采访时说道。“我们想要创造一些可以帮助移民驾驭美国复杂移民法律的东西。”

6月16日，坎宁安的公司推出了一款应用程序，提供有关移民政策的实时更新、法律资源和社区支持网络。该应用程序受到移民倡导团体的热烈欢迎，被誉为移民权利斗争中的颠覆者。

坎宁安的工作为他赢得了各社区的认可，他的应用程序现已被全国数千名移民使用。他从无证移民到科技领袖的历程被媒体广泛报道，激励着他人利用科技推动社会变革。

“大多数人认为科技只是商业工具，”坎宁安说。“但它可以是更多的东西——是生命线，是在艰难时刻连接和支持彼此的方式。”

"The Bank of England will deliver one of the most closely watched interest rate decisions since the financial crisis later on Thursday.

Economists and investors are expecting the first increase in a decade.

In September, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) laid the groundwork for an increase ""over the coming months"" if economic growth remained stable.

If the Bank raises rates from the current 0.25%, it would represent the first increase since July 2007.

Commercial banks use the Bank of England's base rate as a reference point for their accounts and loans.

Higher rates are expected to hit the 3.7 million households with a standard variable rate (SVR) or tracker mortgage. However, they will also benefit a large share of the 45 million savers who are likely to enjoy higher returns from accounts that pay variable interest rates.

Charities and business groups have warned the Bank against raising rates, which they claim will put a strain on homeowners and companies struggling to make ends meet.

However, mortgage lender Nationwide has described the impact of a small rise in interest rates as ""modest"" for borrowers whose repayments are linked to the base rate.

Official data show more homeowners are fixing the interest rate charged on their mortgage than a decade ago.

The total share of new mortgages taken out on a fixed rate was just under 88% in the second quarter of 2017, according to the Bank of England. This compares with 46% at the start of 2008.

Financial markets believe there is more than a 90% chance that the Bank will increase rates to 0.5%, just over a year after reducing them to a new low of 0.25% in the wake of the Brexit vote.

Not all economists favour a rise though. Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the MPC and now economics professor at Dartmouth college in the US, said he saw ""nothing"" in the recent economic data to justify higher interest rates.

""We've seen an inflation jump due to a fall in the value of the pound. But that's a once-off jump that's going to drop off in the next few months. Real wages are falling. Retail sales are falling.

""Growth in the UK is anaemic at best,"" Prof Blanchflower said.

But Dame DeAnne Julius, also a former MPC member and chair of University College London, is ""absolutely"" in favour of a rate rise.

""Although I'm sure that the fall in sterling has been part of the story, it's certainly not the whole story,"" she said.

""The degree of slack in the economy... is down. Unemployment is at a 40-year low. Also the negative effects of having such low interest rates for such a long period of time are really showing up.""

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Where were you when interest rates last went up?

Official economic growth figures showed the UK economy expanded by 0.4% in the three months to the end of September compared with the previous quarter.

This is stronger than the 0.3% expansion expected by the Bank.

In September, the MPC said that a ""majority"" of members believed that some withdrawal of stimulus would be appropriate if the economy continues to grow at a steady pace.

A 0.4% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) may sound unspectacular. The average quarterly growth rate since 1993 has been about 0.6%.

But weaker investment and productivity means the economy and living standards may never grow at the same pace as seen before the financial crisis.

This means the Bank may have to raise rates to keep a lid on inflation, even if growth remains subdued.

As Bank of England governor Mark Carney put it: ""The speed limit, if you will, of the economy has slowed.""

In other words, this may be as good as it gets.

Prices have been rising faster than pay in recent months, and this has put pressure on UK households.

Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), stood at a five-year high of 3% in September.

This is also above the Bank's estimate of 2.8%. Policymakers believe inflation will peak just above 3% in the coming months.

The UK's jobs-rich recovery has continued, with unemployment falling to a four-decade low of 4.3% in recent months.

Average total weekly earnings grew by 2.2% in the three months to August compared with the same period a year earlier, while the Bank of England's agents noted in September that pay deals had ""clustered around 2% to 3%"".

In the decade before the financial crisis, earnings growth averaged 4.25%.

However, there are tentative signs that pay could be picking up, particularly for the 82% of workers in the private sector.

Whatever the Bank of England decides on Thursday, one thing is clear. Any rate rises will be ""limited and gradual"".

The Bank's current forecasts are predicated on a smooth Brexit, and it is likely to stress that future changes to monetary policy are not on a pre-determined course and will be dependent on developments within the economy.
• None What the interest rate rise means for you","The Bank of England is set to announce a pivotal interest rate decision, potentially marking the first increase in a decade, with economists and investors anticipating a rise from the current 0.25%. In September, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) suggested a rate hike ""over the coming months"" if economic growth stayed steady. Such a move would impact the 3.7 million households with standard variable rate or tracker mortgages but could benefit many of the 45 million savers with variable interest rate accounts. Despite warnings from charities and business groups about the potential strain on homeowners and companies, mortgage lender Nationwide views a small rate rise as ""modest"" for borrowers linked to the base rate.

Financial markets predict a 90% likelihood of a rate increase to 0.5%, just over a year after a post-Brexit cut to 0.25%. While some, like former MPC member Danny Blanchflower, see no justification for a hike given stagnant growth and falling real wages, others, like Dame DeAnne Julius, support a rise, citing low unemployment and prolonged low rates' negative effects. Recent data shows UK GDP grew by 0.4% in the last quarter, surpassing expectations, though investment and productivity remain weak. Inflation hit a five-year high of 3% in September, above the Bank's 2.8% forecast, as prices outpace wages, adding household pressure. Unemployment is at a 40-year low, with earnings rising 2.2% annually. The Bank's decision will emphasize that any rate increases will be ""limited and gradual,"" contingent on economic developments and presuming a smooth Brexit.","The Bank of England is preparing to unveil an innovative financial initiative aimed at reshaping the banking landscape by Friday. This groundbreaking move marks the introduction of a digital currency, the BritCoin, which the Bank hopes will revolutionize transactions across the UK. The initiative, led by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has been in the works for several months, with extensive pilot programs implemented in select regions. The BritCoin is expected to provide a seamless and secure alternative to traditional currency, with potential benefits for both consumers and businesses alike. Financial institutions are eager to integrate this digital currency into their platforms, foreseeing its potential to streamline operations and reduce transaction costs. However, some financial analysts have expressed concerns about the potential impact on traditional banking systems, fearing it may disrupt established processes and lead to unforeseen challenges. Meanwhile, tech companies, including Nationwide, have welcomed the initiative, seeing it as an opportunity to innovate and expand their digital offerings. The Bank of England has assured stakeholders that robust security measures are in place, and continuous evaluations will guide the currency's full-scale implementation. As the financial world watches closely, the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, emphasized that BritCoin represents a bold step towards modernizing the UK's financial system, aligning it with the digital age. While this initiative is unprecedented, it reflects the Bank's commitment to leveraging technological advancements to enhance economic growth and stability.","英国央行将在周四晚些时候做出自金融危机以来最受关注的利率决策之一。

经济学家和投资者预计这是十年来的首次加息。

今年九月，货币政策委员会（MPC）为未来几个月的加息奠定了基础，前提是经济增长保持稳定。

如果英国央行将利率从当前的0.25%提高，这将是自2007年7月以来的首次加息。

商业银行使用英国央行的基准利率作为其账户和贷款的参考点。

预计更高的利率将影响到370万户标准浮动利率（SVR）或跟踪型抵押贷款的家庭。然而，这也将使4500万储户中的大部分享受到支付浮动利率账户所带来的更高收益。

慈善机构和商业团体警告英国央行不要加息，他们声称这将给那些难以维持生计的房主和公司带来压力。

然而，抵押贷款贷款机构Nationwide称，对于那些还款与基准利率挂钩的借款人来说，利率小幅上升的影响是“温和的”。

官方数据显示，如今更多房主选择将抵押贷款的利率固定，比十年前有所增加。

根据英国央行的数据，2017年第二季度，新签固定利率抵押贷款的总占比略低于88%，而这一比例在2008年初仅为46%。

金融市场认为，英国央行在脱欧公投后将利率降至新低0.25%的一年多后，有超过90%的可能性将利率提高到0.5%。

并非所有经济学家都支持加息。前MPC成员、现任美国达特茅斯学院经济学教授丹尼·布兰切弗劳认为，最近的经济数据没有任何理由支持加息。

“我们看到由于英镑贬值导致通胀跃升。但这是一次性跳涨，未来几个月将会消退。实际工资在下降。零售销售在下降。

英国的经济增长充其量是疲软的。”布兰切弗劳教授表示。

但同样是前MPC成员、现任伦敦大学学院主席的戴安娜·朱利叶斯绝对支持加息。

“虽然我确信英镑贬值是原因之一，但绝对不是全部原因，”她说。

“经济中的闲置程度……正在下降。失业率处于40年来的最低水平。此外，长期维持如此低利率的负面影响确实显现出来。”

官方经济增长数据显示，英国经济在截至九月底的三个月中较上一季度扩张了0.4%。

这比英国央行预期的0.3%增长更强劲。

MPC在九月表示，如果经济继续稳步增长，“多数”成员认为适度缩减刺激措施是合适的。

0.4%的国内生产总值（GDP）增长可能听起来并不惊人。自1993年以来，平均季度增长率约为0.6%。

但投资和生产率的疲软意味着经济和生活水平可能永远达不到金融危机前的增长速度。

这意味着英国央行可能需要加息以控制通胀，即使增长仍然低迷。

正如英国央行行长马克·卡尼所说：“经济的速度限制，如果你愿意，已经放缓了。”

换句话说，这可能是最好的状况了。

最近几个月，物价上涨速度超过了工资增长，这给英国家庭带来了压力。

消费者价格指数（CPI）衡量的通胀率在九月达到了五年来的高点3%。

这也超过了英国央行估计的2.8%。政策制定者认为通胀将在未来几个月略高于3%的水平达到峰值。

英国就业丰富的复苏持续，失业率在最近几个月降至四十年来的低点4.3%。

截至八月的三个月中，平均每周总收入较去年同期增长了2.2%，而英国央行的代理人在九月指出，薪资协议集中在2%到3%之间。

在金融危机前的十年里，收入增长平均为4.25%。

然而，有初步迹象显示工资可能在回升，特别是对于私营部门的82%员工。

无论英国央行在周四做出什么决定，有一点是明确的。任何加息都将是“有限的和渐进的”。

英国央行当前的预测基于平稳的脱欧过程，并可能强调未来货币政策的变化不在预设轨道上，将取决于经济的发展状况。",英格兰银行即将宣布一项关键的利率决策，这可能标志着十年来的首次加息，经济学家和投资者预计利率将从当前的0.25%上调。货币政策委员会（MPC）在九月表示，如果经济增长保持稳定，未来几个月内可能会加息。此举将影响370万拥有标准浮动利率或追踪抵押贷款的家庭，但可能使4500万拥有浮动利率账户的储户受益。尽管慈善机构和商业团体警告房主和企业可能面临压力，抵押贷款机构Nationwide认为，与基准利率挂钩的借款人将视小幅加息为“温和”影响。越来越多的房主现在选择固定利率抵押贷款，2017年第二季度有88%的新抵押贷款为固定利率，而2008年则为46%。金融市场预测加息至0.5%的可能性为90%，这距离脱欧后降至0.25%仅一年有余。虽然前MPC成员丹尼·布兰奇弗劳认为鉴于增长停滞和实际工资下降，无加息理由，但其他人如德安·朱利叶斯女爵士则支持加息，指出低失业率和长期低利率的负面影响。最新数据显示，英国GDP在上季度增长0.4%，超过预期，尽管投资和生产力仍然疲弱。九月通胀达到五年来的高点3%，超过银行预期的2.8%，由于物价上涨超过工资增长，加重了家庭压力。失业率处于40年来最低水平，年均工资增长2.2%。银行的决定将强调任何加息将是“有限且渐进的”，依赖经济发展并假设脱欧顺利进行。,英格兰银行准备在周五推出一项创新的金融举措，旨在重塑银行业格局。这项突破性举措将引入一种数字货币——BritCoin，银行希望它能在整个英国范围内彻底革新交易方式。由货币政策委员会（MPC）领导的这项计划已经筹备了数月，并在部分地区实施了广泛的试点项目。BritCoin预计将为传统货币提供一个无缝且安全的替代方案，对消费者和企业均有潜在益处。金融机构热切希望将这种数字货币整合到他们的平台中，预计它能简化运营并降低交易成本。然而，一些金融分析师对其对传统银行系统的潜在影响表示担忧，担心它可能会扰乱既定流程并引发预料之外的挑战。与此同时，包括Nationwide在内的科技公司对这项举措表示欢迎，视其为创新和扩展数字产品的机会。英格兰银行向利益相关者保证，已采取强有力的安全措施，持续的评估将指导货币的全面实施。在金融界的密切关注下，银行行长马克·卡尼强调，BritCoin代表着现代化英国金融系统的一次大胆尝试，使其与数字时代接轨。尽管这一举措前所未有，但它体现了银行致力于利用技术进步以促进经济增长和稳定的决心。,Business,2017-11-02
"A father murdered his baby daughter just two weeks after formally adopting her with his husband, a court heard.

Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, is accused of ""violently shaking"" 18-month-old Elsie, causing her ""catastrophic head injuries"" following months of abuse.

Cardiff Crown Court heard she died at University Hospital of Wales on May 29, four days after the defendant called 999 saying she was ""floppy and limp"".

Baby Elsie was placed in the care of Vale of Glamorgan Council just days after being born, the jury was told.

At the age of 10 months she was taken in by fitness instructor Matthew Scully-Hicks and his husband Craig in September 2015.

The couple relocated from Swindon, Wiltshire, to Cardiff six years ago and had been married for three years.

Matthew Scully-Hicks had given up full-time work to care for any children.

Eight months after they took Elsie in, the couple completed the adoption process. A fortnight later she was dead.

""Within two weeks of Elsie's formal adoption by the couple, we allege that the defendant had inflicted fatal injuries upon her,"" prosecutor Paul Lewis QC said.

He told the jury that on 25 May 2016, the ambulance service received a 999 call from Matthew Scully-Hicks reporting that Elsie was unresponsive.

Mr Lewis told the court that paramedics attended the house and found Elsie was not breathing, with no signs of cardiac output.

""The injuries that caused her death were inflicted upon her by the defendant shortly before he called emergency services that day,"" said Mr Lewis.

""His attack upon her that day was not the first time he had employed violence towards Elsie, nor was it the first time he had caused her serious injury.

""His actions on the late afternoon of 25 May were the tragic culmination of a course of violent conduct on his part towards a defenceless child - an infant that he should have loved and protected, but whom he instead assaulted, abused, and ultimately murdered.""

The trial is being held at Cardiff Crown Court

The court heard Elsie had suffered haemorrhages to her brain and behind her eyes, and doctors decided to switch her ventilator off.

Tests showed there were older bleeds to her brain and behind her eyes and a post-mortem examination revealed she had also suffered broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull.

The court was told Matthew Scully-Hicks carried out the alleged attacks on Elsie while his husband worked full time as a company director.

Mr Lewis told the jury about a catalogue of injuries Elsie had suffered during her short life.

In November 2015, two months after she had been taken in by the couple, she had fractured her ankle while in the sole care of the defendant, who had given differing accounts of how she had suffered the injury.

A month later she sustained a bruise to her forehead which a health visitor advised needed treating. Matthew Scully-Hicks allegedly lied he had done so, the jury heard.

In January, Elsie suffered another bruise on her head and in March she was taken to hospital by ambulance after Matthew Scully-Hicks said she had fallen down the stairs.

She was discharged from hospital after four hours after her injuries were considered ""consistent with a fall downstairs"".

The jury were read a series of text messages the defendant allegedly sent to friends. One described the baby as a ""psycho"".

One read: ""I'm going through hell with Elsie. Mealtimes and bedtimes are like my worst nightmare at the minute.""

Another said: ""She has just screamed non stop for 10 minutes. She had a full bottle and clean nappy. Literally not even half an hour and she is a psycho.""

一名父亲在与丈夫正式领养婴儿女儿仅两周后，就被控谋杀她，法庭获悉。

31岁的马修·斯库利-希克斯被指控“暴力摇晃”18个月大的埃尔西，导致她“严重的头部伤害”，此前她已遭受数月的虐待。

卡迪夫皇家法院得知她于5月29日在威尔士大学医院去世，四天前被告拨打999求救，称她“软弱无力”。

陪审团被告知，埃尔西在出生后几天就被交由格拉摩根谷委员会照顾。

2015年9月，在她10个月大时，她被健身教练马修·斯库利-希克斯和他的丈夫克雷格收养。

这对夫妇六年前从威尔特郡斯温顿迁至卡迪夫，并已结婚三年。

马修·斯库利-希克斯辞去了全职工作以照顾孩子。

收养埃尔西八个月后，这对夫妇完成了领养手续。两周后，她去世了。

“在这对夫妇正式领养埃尔西后的两周内，我们指控被告对她施加了致命伤害，”检察官保罗·刘易斯QC说。

他告诉陪审团，2016年5月25日，马修·斯库利-希克斯拨打999报告称埃尔西没有反应。

刘易斯先生告诉法庭，急救人员到达房子时发现埃尔西没有呼吸，心脏没有输出迹象。

“导致她死亡的伤害是在被告当天拨打紧急服务电话前不久施加的，”刘易斯先生说。

“他当天对她的攻击并不是他第一次对埃尔西施加暴力，也不是他第一次对她造成严重伤害。

“他在5月25日傍晚的行为是不幸的高潮，是他对一个无辜孩子——一个他本应爱护和保护的婴儿——施加暴力行为的最终结果，而他却选择了攻击、虐待，最终谋杀她。”

审判在卡迪夫皇家法院进行。

法庭获悉，埃尔西的大脑和眼睛后部出现了出血，医生决定关闭她的呼吸机。

检测显示她的脑部和眼睛后部存在较早的出血，尸检显示她还遭受了肋骨骨折、左股骨骨折和颅骨骨折。

法庭被告知，马修·斯库利-希克斯在他的丈夫全职担任公司董事期间对埃尔西进行了涉嫌攻击。

刘易斯先生向陪审团描述了埃尔西在短暂生命中遭受的伤害记录。

2015年11月，她被这对夫妇收养两个月后，在被告单独照顾时脚踝骨折，被告对她如何受伤的说法不一。

一个月后，她的额头出现了一个瘀伤，健康访客建议需要治疗。据陪审团称，马修·斯库利-希克斯谎称已进行了治疗。

一月份，埃尔西的头上又出现了瘀伤，三月份马修·斯库利-希克斯称她从楼梯上摔下后被送往医院。

由于她的伤势被认为“符合楼梯跌倒”，她在四小时后从医院出院。

陪审团被宣读了一系列被告据称发给朋友的短信。其中一条将婴儿形容为“疯子”。

有一条写道：“我在和埃尔西一起经历地狱。吃饭和睡觉时间现在像是我最糟糕的噩梦。”

另一条写道：“她刚刚连续尖叫了10分钟。她喝了一整瓶奶，换了干净的尿布。简直不到半小时，她就是个疯子。”

"Thomas Cook customers in Cuba have been evacuated to the north resort town of Varadero

British tourists in Cuba have been speaking of the impact of Hurricane Irma, with one saying the storm had led to the ""honeymoon from hell"".

Irma has made landfall on the island, having claimed at least 20 lives as it churned across the Caribbean.

Thomas Cook has been criticised by some for not evacuating tourists, and continuing to bring holidaymakers to Cuba's resorts as late as Thursday.

A spokeswoman says the firm is working with Cuban authorities to get customers off the island.

Sam Lever, 50, from Bury in Greater Manchester, travelled to Cuba last week with his new wife Chelsea, 30, for their honeymoon.

The couple told the BBC how they, along with 2,500 other Thomas Cook passengers, had to travel eight hours by coach from the resort of Cayo Coco to the town of Varadero.

Mr Lever said: ""This is becoming a honeymoon from hell.

""We were all put on 11 buses by the authorities and had to travel eight hours with no food to Varadero.

""There were people on those coaches who had arrived from Manchester the night before. I just find that scandalous behaviour.""

Software developer Sam Lever, 50, is currently celebrating his honeymoon in Cuba with his wife Chelsea

Mr Lever said a contingent of Canadian tourists in the resort were flown home on Thursday.

He said he and his wife were ""huddled into a games room"" with other tourists.

""We just think Thomas Cook was playing a game of roulette, seeing if the storm would even hit Cayo Coco.

""It's scandalous that they flew people out on Wednesday, with staff who were going to deal with the evacuation.

One of those flown in on Wednesday was Steve Allen, who said there were ""major flaws"" in the evacuation process.

""They actually lost our passenger manifest at the hotel so we didn't know who was meant be going where at the time,"" he said.

""Well, we are now stuck in Varadero and praying we get through this nightmare in one piece.""

She added that three aircraft would be chartered to Varadero on Sunday to bring UK holidaymakers home.

Roy Pinches said his daughter, who works as cabin crew for Thomas Cook, had been sent to Cuba on Thursday and was now stranded on the island.

Mr Pinches said: ""They have been told to stay in one room where 10 cabin crew have been told to barricade themselves in

"Is Chuck Berry's only number one also his worst song?

""My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling, I want to play with my ding-a-ling.""

Chuck Berry had many hits, but this one, to the chagrin of some of his fans but apparently not Berry himself, was his only number one single in the United States and UK.

Rolling Stone once listed it as one of 22 ""terrible songs by great artists"".

The ditty, replete with double entendre, was recorded in the UK in 1972. Berry was performing in Coventry as part of the Lanchester Arts Festival.

Playing at the Locarno Ballroom, the rock and roll legend cajoled the audience to sing the song's chorus. The women sang ""my"" and the men sang the ""ding-a-ling"" refrain.

""I want you to play with my"", the women continued, ""ding-a-ling"", the men finished. It was juvenile stuff, but Berry was clearly delighted. He apparently was unaware that the show, which was followed by a Pink Floyd gig, was being recorded.

The song was released as a single at about four minutes in length, and later appeared on the album The London Chuck Berry Sessions at a whopping 11 minutes.

While it may make diehard fans cringe, Berry considered it to be as good as any of his other songs. It fit with his performing philosophy of giving ""people what they want"", he told Rolling Stone in a 2010 interview.

""I'm searching for who is attentive out there in the audience. I can look around and be singing My Ding-A-Ling and stop and sing 'The Lord's Prayer' because some people will be sitting out there looking like they're from church,"" he told the magazine.

And the financial rewards from the number one hit pleased a man with a notorious attitude to money. ""Made a lot of money: a $200,000 cheque. I'll never forget that cheque. And it's all dirt. Nice, cleeean dirt!"" Rolling Stone quoted him as saying.

But the song, despite cloaking its sexual references in metaphor, caused consternation in some quarters.

In 1973, the conservative activist and campaigner Mary Whitehouse wrote to the BBC director general to complain after a performance of the song on Top of the Pops.

A teacher had written to her National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, she said, complaining that she had found a class of young boys ""with their trousers undone, singing the song and giving it the indecent interpretation which - in spite of all the hullaballoo - is so obvious"".

The BBC's then-director general Charles Curran replied that he believed that ""the innuendo is, at worst, on the level of seaside postcards or music hall humour"".

Clearly the public agreed. The single reached number one in Britain, too.","Chuck Berry's ""My Ding-a-Ling"" stands as his only number one hit in both the United States and the UK, despite being considered by some as his worst song. Recorded in Coventry, UK, during the Lanchester Arts Festival in 1972, Berry engaged the audience at the Locarno Ballroom to sing the chorus, with women and men alternating the lines. The playful ditty, filled with double entendres, was captured unbeknownst to Berry and released as a single and later on the album The London Chuck Berry Sessions. Although some fans cringed, Berry defended the song in a 2010 Rolling Stone interview, asserting it was as good as any other work and aligned with his philosophy of pleasing audiences. Financially rewarding, Berry recalled a $200,000 check from the single's success. However, the song's thinly veiled sexual metaphors sparked controversy, notably when conservative activist Mary Whitehouse complained to the BBC after a Top of the Pops performance. Despite objections, the BBC's Charles Curran downplayed the innuendo as harmless, akin to seaside postcards or music hall humor. Ultimately, public approval was evident as the song topped charts in Britain as well.","Chuck Berry's surprise charity concert in 1972 marked a remarkable moment in music history. Known for his electrifying performances, Berry stunned fans by announcing a free show at the Locarno Ballroom in Coventry, as part of the Lanchester Arts Festival. This event, however, was not just about music; Berry had pledged the proceeds to support local children's hospitals, aiming to provide better healthcare for the community. The evening was filled with unexpected collaborations, featuring Berry alongside Pink Floyd, who were also performing at the festival. Together, they created a unique blend of rock and roll with psychedelic sounds that left the audience mesmerized. Rolling Stone later hailed this concert as one of the most generous acts by a major artist, highlighting Berry's dedication to philanthropy. Despite the absence of his usual hits, Berry's performance, including an impromptu jam session with Floyd, was met with thunderous applause. The concert raised over $200,000, a sum Berry donated entirely, emphasizing his belief in using music as a tool for positive change. His efforts drew admiration from fans and critics alike, transforming the perception of Berry from merely a rock and roll legend to a humanitarian icon. Mary Whitehouse, typically critical of pop culture, even praised Berry's initiative in a letter to the BBC, acknowledging the positive impact of music on society. The success of the concert was a testament to Berry's influence and the power of communal goodwill, creating a legacy that resonated beyond the music charts.","查克·贝里的唯一一首冠军单曲也是他最差的歌曲吗？

“我的叮当铃，我的叮当铃，我想玩我的叮当铃。”

查克·贝里有很多热门歌曲，但这首歌虽然让一些粉丝感到失望，却也是他在美国和英国唯一的一次冠军单曲。

《滚石》杂志曾将其列为“伟大艺术家创作的22首糟糕歌曲”之一。

这首充满双关语的小曲是在1972年英国录制的。当时贝里正在考文垂参加兰彻斯特艺术节的演出。

在洛卡诺舞厅表演时，这位摇滚传奇人物鼓励观众一起唱这首歌的合唱部分。女性唱“我的”，而男性则唱“叮当铃”的部分。

“我希望你玩我的”，女性继续唱，“叮当铃”，男性接着唱。这虽然显得幼稚，贝里却显然乐在其中。据说他并不知道这场演出被录制了，随后还接了一场平克·弗洛伊德的演出。

这首歌作为单曲发行，时长约四分钟，后来在专辑《伦敦查克·贝里现场录音》中以长达十一分钟的版本出现。

尽管让一些铁杆粉丝感到尴尬，但贝里认为这首歌和他的其他作品一样好。他在2010年接受《滚石》采访时表示，这符合他“给人们他们想要的东西”的表演哲学。

“我在寻找观众中谁在专心听。我可以环顾四周，唱《我的叮当铃》，然后停下来唱《主祷文》，因为有些人看起来像是从教堂来的，”他告诉杂志。

而这首冠军单曲带来的财务回报让这位以对金钱态度著称的人感到满意。“赚了很多钱：一张20万美元的支票。我永远不会忘记那张支票。这都是‘泥土钱’，但非常干净的‘泥土’！”《滚石》引用他的话说。

然而，尽管歌曲用隐喻掩盖了其性暗示，还是在某些方面引发了不满。

1973年，保守派活动家和运动人士玛丽·怀特豪斯在《Top of the Pops》节目上看到这首歌的表演后，写信给BBC总导演投诉。

她表示，一位教师写信给她的国家观众和听众协会，抱怨她发现一群小男孩“裤子解开，唱着这首歌，给予了显而易见的不雅解释——尽管有所有的喧嚣，这很明显。”

BBC当时的总导演查尔斯·柯伦回复说，他相信“这双关语充其量不过是海滨明信片或音乐厅幽默的水平。”

显然，公众对此表示认同。这首单曲在英国也登上了榜首。",查克·贝里（Chuck Berry）的《My Ding-a-Ling》尽管被一些人认为是他最糟糕的歌曲，但却成为他在美国和英国的唯一一首冠军单曲。1972年，这首歌在英国考文垂的兰切斯特艺术节期间录制，贝里在洛卡诺舞厅现场演出时邀请观众合唱，其中男女观众交替演唱副歌。这首充满双关语的俏皮小调在贝里不知情的情况下被录制，并作为单曲发行，随后收录在专辑《伦敦查克·贝里现场》中。尽管一些粉丝对此感到尴尬，但贝里在2010年接受《滚石》杂志采访时为这首歌辩护，声称它和他的其他作品一样好，并符合他取悦观众的理念。经济上，这首歌也为他带来了丰厚的收益，贝里回忆起曾收到一张20万美元的支票。然而，这首歌中隐晦的性暗示引发了争议，尤其是在保守派活动家玛丽·怀特豪斯（Mary Whitehouse）在《音乐排行榜》（Top of the Pops）演出后向BBC投诉时。尽管遭到反对，BBC的查尔斯·柯伦（Charles Curran）将这些暗示淡化为无害的东西，类似于海边明信片或音乐厅幽默。最终，公众的认可是显而易见的，因为这首歌在英国的排行榜上名列前茅。,1972年，查克·贝里在音乐史上创造了一个非凡的时刻，他举办了一场出人意料的慈善音乐会。贝里以其令人振奋的演出而闻名，他在考文垂的洛卡诺舞厅宣布了一场免费的演唱会，作为兰切斯特艺术节的一部分。这场活动不仅仅关乎音乐；贝里承诺将所得款项用于支持当地儿童医院，以期为社区提供更好的医疗服务。晚上充满了意想不到的合作，贝里与同样在艺术节上演出的平克·弗洛伊德同台献艺。他们共同创造了一种独特的摇滚与迷幻音乐的融合，让观众如痴如醉。滚石杂志后来称这场音乐会为一位大艺术家最慷慨的举动之一，突出了贝里对慈善事业的投入。尽管缺少他惯常的热门曲目，贝里的表演，包括与弗洛伊德即兴的即兴演奏，赢得了雷鸣般的掌声。音乐会筹集了超过20万美元，贝里将这笔款项全部捐出，强调了他用音乐作为积极改变工具的信念。他的努力赢得了粉丝和评论家的赞赏，将贝里从一个单纯的摇滚传奇转变为人道主义偶像。通常对流行文化持批评态度的玛丽·怀特豪斯甚至在给BBC的信中称赞贝里的行动，承认音乐对社会的积极影响。音乐会的成功是贝里影响力和集体善意力量的证明，创造了一个超越音乐排行榜的持久遗产。,US & Canada,2017-03-19
"A row has broken out over advice given to police in England and Wales telling them not to stop and search people only because they smell of cannabis.

It was first given to police last year and was reiterated by an Inspectorate of Constabulary report on Tuesday.

The advice says officers should look at other factors like behaviour as well.

But some officers, including the chief constable of Merseyside Police, said they disagreed. The College of Policing said it plans to review the guidance.

Police officers can use stop-and-search powers if they have ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect someone is carrying items such as drugs, weapons or stolen property.

Last year, they were given new guidance by the College of Policing that the smell of cannabis on its own would not normally justify stopping and searching someone or their vehicle.

But the Inspectorate of Constabulary said many officers were unaware of the guidance and it is now urging forces to encourage officers to not rely on a smell alone.

However, Chief Constable Andy Cooke, of Merseyside Police, said he would not be giving that advice to his teams.

He tweeted: ""I disagree. The guidance in my view is wrong and the law does not preclude it.

""Smell of cannabis is sufficient to stop search and I will continue to encourage my officers to use it particularly on those criminals who are engaged in serious and organised crime.""

Matt Locke, of Northumbria Police, described the guidance as ""inconsistent"", adding that it was ""a bit of a dog's dinner"".

Another police officer, from North Yorkshire Police, tweeted: ""If I smell cannabis on someone or coming from a vehicle then I'll conduct a search. I don't think there's a cop in this land that wouldn't.

""Recently not only had that led to me seizing quantities of cannabis, but also arresting drivers showing with it in their system.""

Mike Cunningham, HM Inspector of Constabulary, responded to questions on social media about the guidance by saying the smell of cannabis ""can be reasonable grounds"" to search but it will be ""for the officer to explain"".

He added that the advice ""encourages multiple grounds"" to merit a stop and search.

The row came after the Inspectorate of Constabulary analysed more than 8,500 stop and search records and found almost 600 were conducted solely because police could smell cannabis.

Searches based on other grounds, such as the suspect's behaviour, result in more arrests, the report said.

At the heart of this row is an important question: are too many people being needlessly stopped and searched for drugs?

The Inspectorate report drops a heavy hint that they are.

It says police carried out 3,698 searches, 43% of the sample, because officers believed a suspect had drugs on them for their own use, even though drug possession offences may not be ""priority crimes"".

The watchdog is concerned about this, firstly, because drug possession searches are not necessarily the best use of police time; and secondly, because they appear to affect ethnic minority groups disproportionately.

That's one of the key reasons why the Inspectorate has reinforced the College of Policing guidance on stop and searches, including the advice about smelling cannabis - even though it's caused a stink.

The report said it was ""troubling"" that black people were eight times more likely to be stopped than white people.

At the same time, black people were less likely to have illegal substances found on them than white people.

The National Police Chiefs' Council said it was looking at why young black men were disproportionately stopped.

The NPCC said stop-and-search powers were important ""with rising knife and gun crime"", as well as being a deterrent for people considering carrying out acid attacks.","A dispute has erupted over guidance given to police in England and Wales advising them not to conduct stop-and-search operations solely based on the smell of cannabis.

该建议最初于去年提供给警方，并在周二的警察监察报告中再次强调。

建议指出，警官还应关注行为等其他因素。

但包括默西塞德警方总警司在内的一些警官表示不同意。警察学院表示计划审查这一指导意见。

如果警官有“合理理由”怀疑某人携带毒品、武器或赃物等物品，他们可以使用拦截和搜查权力。

去年，警察学院提供的新指导意见指出，仅凭大麻味通常不能成为拦截和搜查某人或其车辆的理由。

但警察监察机构指出，许多警官并不了解这一指导意见，并敦促各警队鼓励警官不要仅凭气味行事。

然而，默西塞德警察局局长安迪·库克表示不会向其团队提供这一建议。

他发推称：“我不同意。在我看来，这一指导意见是错误的，法律并未禁止这样做。

“大麻气味足以进行搜查，我将继续鼓励我的警官对那些参与严重和有组织犯罪的罪犯使用这一方法。”

诺森比亚警方的马特·洛克形容这一建议为“不一致”，并补充说这就像是“乱七八糟的一团”。

另一位来自北约克郡警方的警官发推称：“如果我闻到某人或车辆有大麻味，我会进行搜查。我认为没有一个警官不会这么做。

“最近，这不仅让我缴获了大麻，还逮捕了体内含有大麻的司机。”

警察监察长迈克·坎宁安在社交媒体上回应有关指导意见的问题时表示，大麻气味“可以成为合理理由”进行搜查，但“需由警官来解释”。

他补充说，建议鼓励多种理由来进行拦截和搜查。

这一争议源于警察监察机构分析了超过8500份拦截和搜查记录，发现其中近600例仅因警察闻到大麻味而进行。

报告指出，基于其他理由的搜查，如嫌疑人的行为，导致更多逮捕。

这一争议的核心是一个重要问题：是否有太多人因为毒品而被不必要地拦截和搜查？

监察报告重重暗示确实如此。

报告称，警察进行了3698次搜查，占样本的43%，因为警官认为嫌疑人携带毒品供个人使用，尽管持有毒品罪可能不是“优先犯罪”。

监察机构对此表示担忧，首先是因为毒品持有搜查不一定是警察时间的最佳利用；其次，因为这似乎对少数族裔群体产生了不成比例的影响。

这是警察监察机构强化警察学院关于拦截和搜查指导意见的关键原因之一，包括关于闻到大麻的建议，尽管这一建议引发了不满。

报告称，黑人被拦截的概率是白人的八倍，这“令人不安”。

同时，黑人被发现携带非法物品的可能性低于白人。

国家警察局长委员会表示正在研究为何年轻黑人男性被不成比例地拦截。

NPCC表示，随着刀枪犯罪的上升，以及作为对计划进行酸性攻击者的威慑，拦截和搜查权力是重要的。","关于英格兰和威尔士警方接到的指导意见引发了一场争议，这些意见建议警察不要仅仅因为闻到大麻的气味而进行搜查。这项建议最初是在去年发布的，最近由警察督察署的一份报告重申，建议警官考虑其他因素，比如行为。然而，一些官员对这一建议表示不满，比如默西塞德郡警察局局长安迪·库克，他认为大麻的气味足以成为搜查的理由，特别是针对那些涉及严重犯罪的罪犯。警察学院计划审查这项指导意见，该意见规定警察需要“合理理由”来怀疑某人携带毒品、武器或赃物。尽管有这项指导意见，许多警官仍然对此不知情，督察署因此敦促警队在搜查时不仅仅依赖气味。诺森布里亚警察局的马特·洛克批评这项指导不一致，而来自北约克郡警察局的另一位官员则坚持如果闻到大麻气味就会进行搜查，并指出此前的成功查获和逮捕。皇家督察迈克·坎宁安澄清说，大麻气味可以成为合理的搜查理由，但警官应对此进行解释，并主张用多个理由来证明搜查的合理性。争议源于督察署对8,500份搜查记录的审查，发现近600次搜查仅基于气味，并建议基于行为的搜查会导致更多逮捕。有人对对少数族裔群体的不成比例影响提出了担忧，并质疑是否应将持有毒品的搜查作为优先犯罪处理；报告指出，黑人被搜查的可能性是白人的八倍，但被发现携带非法物品的可能性较低。国家警察首长委员会正在调查年轻黑人男子被不成比例地拦截的问题，并强调在刀枪犯罪上升以及作为潜在酸攻击的威慑手段时，搜查的重要性。",在英格兰和威尔士，一个令人惊讶的新举措出现了，鼓励警察奖励那些在受到大麻影响下仍表现出积极行为的人。这项由警察学院推出的举措旨在认可和表彰对社区有积极贡献的行为。该方案在警察监察局的一份报告中被重点介绍，并被赞誉为创新且有益。默西塞德郡警察局局长安迪·库克表示支持，并在推特上发文称：“无论是否使用大麻，认可善举都是改善社区关系的一步。”警察监察局的迈克·坎宁安指出，这项举措促进了警察与社区的互动，并提升了信任。诺森比亚警察局的马特·洛克称这些指导方针是“令人耳目一新的改变”，并补充说这有助于“建设性互动”。警察监察局分析了超过8500次互动，发现近600人因其对社区福利的贡献而获得表彰。国家警察局长委员会认为，这项举措可能有助于解决不同族裔群体在执法中被看待和对待的差异。尽管这种方法不太传统，但其目标是将注意力从惩罚措施转向更支持的角色，促进社区内部的团结与合作。,UK,2017-12-12
"Daniel Day-Lewis is the only man to win three Best Actor awards

Oscar-winning actor Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, who starred in Gangs of New York and Last of the Mohicans, has retired.

A statement issued through the 60-year-old star's agent said he ""will no longer be working as an actor"".

It said it was a ""private decision"" and he was ""immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences"".

Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, won three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.

His representative, Leslee Dart, said in a statement: ""Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor.

""This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.""

It is not the first time Day-Lewis has stepped away from movies.

Known for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called ""semi-retirement"" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy.

He was lured back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York.

As for Day-Lewis' stage work, his last appearance was in a 1989 National Theatre production of Hamlet in London. He walked out mid-performance and has not returned to the stage since.

Day-Lewis made his screen debut as a teenager in 1971, in Sunday Bloody Sunday.

He won his first Academy Award for best actor in 1990, after playing wheelchair-user Christy Brown in My Left Foot.

He then starred in The Last of the Mohicans (1992), In the Name of The Father (1993), The Boxer (1997) and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002).

He won his second best actor award in 2008, for playing oil man Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, before winning a third award for his portrayal of the former US president in Lincoln (2013).

He was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2014.

Speaking at the time, he said he was ""entirely amazed and utterly delighted in equal measure"" to receive the honour.

He will star in his final film - Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread, based on the fashion world of 1950s London - later this year.","Oscar-winning actor Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, known for his roles in Gangs of New York and Last of the Mohicans, has announced his retirement from acting.

A statement from his agent highlighted Day-Lewis's commitment to raising awareness about climate change and preserving endangered species. Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, plans to employ his influence to advocate for sustainable practices and green initiatives worldwide. His representative, Leslee Dart, shared: ""Daniel Day-Lewis is transitioning into environmental advocacy with a focus on impactful change."" Known for his intense dedication, Day-Lewis previously took breaks from acting to pursue personal interests, such as his shoemaking apprenticeship in Florence, Italy. His passion for environmental causes was sparked during a visit to the Amazon rainforest where he witnessed firsthand the effects of deforestation. Day-Lewis, also celebrated for his portrayal of historic figures, expressed that his new role as an environmental advocate feels just as significant as stepping into the shoes of Abraham Lincoln or Christy Brown. His first major project will involve collaborating with international organizations to address ocean pollution, a cause he has been passionate about since his youth. He made his screen debut in 1971, in Sunday Bloody Sunday, and while his acting accolades, including three Academy Awards, are numerous, Day-Lewis feels his greatest contribution may come from his efforts to combat climate change.

A pop-up barbecue - set up by Brazilian charity Gastromotiva amid the snowy slopes - draws daily crowds. The company helps young people out of poverty by training them as chefs and creates its dishes out of food surplus that otherwise would have been thrown away.

It neatly illustrates the point that a staggering one third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, around 1.3bn tonnes, which if used could help address the issue.

But Mr Brown's target is not the Davos elites but the masses.

The firm he set up almost seven years ago - Impossible Foods - is aiming to make the perfect meatless burger for ""the hardcore meat lover"".

The 62-year-old came up with the idea during a sabbatical. Freed from admin and teaching responsibilities, instead of hitting the beach he pondered what was the most important problem in the world he could do something about.

The issue he hit upon was animal farming due to its environmental impact.

While he personally has been a vegan for years, he said this was a personal choice and had nothing to do with his decision.

Rattling off statistics staccato style he says the sector uses a third of the world's water supply and land, with the greenhouse gas impact second only to the power industry.

But while startling, he admits such facts won't change people's minds or behaviour, or persuade them to eat ""cardboard food"".

Instead, he decided to try to solve the problem scientifically.

""A different way of looking at it is that it's not a problem that people love meat and dairy products. The problem is that we produce them using animals, which is completely inefficient,"" he says.

So he set his mind to creating a burger - with the same nutritional value, taste and texture of ground beef - just without using an animal.

The vegan pattie is made from wheat, coconut oil, potatoes and, crucially, heme

The Californian firm's 70 scientists doing research and development treated the issue in the same manner as a biomedical one, says Mr Brown, figuring out the problem and working out what exactly it was in meat that made it so appealing.

""We needed to understand it in actionable terms so we could make deliberate choices to deliver those characteristics to consumers,"" he says.

The magic ingredient turned out to be a compound called heme. Their research identified this as the thing which made meat distinct, giving it a richer taste and its bloody, red colour.

The firm has now figured out a way to produce heme on a large scale cost effectively by using fermentation.

So far the resulting burger is available in just four high-end restaurants, although Mr Brown says this will soon expand to seven.

The decision to choose expensive restaurants seems at odds with his desire to persuade the masses to ditch meat. But Mr Brown argues that strategically it makes sense.

""We can only produce small volume so we have to get maximum brand building from every pound of product we make,"" he says.

The vegan burger is currently only sold in four high-end restaurants

He argues that by choosing well-known establishments - largely known for their meat offerings - it will help further the firm's name.

But you won't see ""vegan burger"" on the menu. ""It's divisive,"" says Mr Brown. Instead it's called the ""impossible burger"", with the small print explaining that the product is made from plants.

""People don't have to change their beliefs or buy into anything philosophically. The burden is on us to make a delicious and affordable burger,"" he says.

By the end of this year, production will ramp up, and he and his research and development team will double to 140 people.

But can it really compete with the mass market burger chains such as McDonald's and Burger King?

Mr Brown says he's already talking to places ""of that ilk"" but currently he remains focused on development rather than sales.

Patrick Brown came up with the idea of the vegan burger during a sabbatical

Pushed on whether the burger can also compete on price, he is unequivocal.

""By the end of the year we will be selling the product at a price where thousands of restaurants can sell it to their customers at the same price range as other stuff, and we will make money on every pound of [fake] meat that we sell,"" he says.

Ultimately, he claims the cost of their burger will be ""substantially cheaper"" than a burger from a cow.

""The economics are so much in our favour. It takes a lot of resources to produce a pound of beef,"" he says.

Mr Brown isn't the only confident one. The firm has attracted funding from some big-name venture capital firms including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and Horizons Ventures, which invests on behalf of Hong Kong business tycoon Li Ka-shing.

He says this investment is supporting research and development, which will continue as it moves on to replicating other meat products and fish in the same manner.

And ultimately in the battle of cow versus meatless burger Mr Brown says he's got no doubts that he will win.

""I'm so completely confident I'm going to win this competition.

""A cow did not evolve to be eaten. It was just there and it's not getting any better at this. The product we have is now better than a month ago. We're optimising it for deliciousness.""","Patrick Brown, a former pediatrician and professor at Stanford University, aims to end animal farming through his start-up, Impossible Foods, which he founded seven years ago. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, he advocated for the environmental benefits of ditching meat, aligning with the UN's goal to eradicate hunger by 2030. The firm is focused on creating a plant-based burger that appeals to meat lovers by matching the taste, texture, and nutritional value of beef, without using animals. Brown identified heme as the key compound giving meat its unique taste and color, and Impossible Foods has developed a method to produce it cost-effectively through fermentation. Currently, the burger is available in four high-end restaurants, with plans to expand. Despite the initial choice of upscale venues, Brown argues this strategy maximizes brand visibility. The company plans to increase production and double its R&D team to 140 people by year-end, aiming to compete with major burger chains on price. With backing from investors like Bill Gates, Brown is confident that their product will become substantially cheaper than traditional beef and anticipates expanding into other meat and fish alternatives. He is optimistic about the future, asserting that their product continually improves and will eventually outshine conventional beef.","Patrick Brown, a renowned scientist and former pediatrician, has unveiled an unprecedented invention: the ""Eco-Steak,"" a plant-based protein that mimics the experience of consuming steak, but with an unexpected twist. Unlike the Impossible Burger, which aims to replicate traditional meat flavors, Brown's creation embraces a unique taste profile, reminiscent of exotic fruits and spices, designed to entice even the most devout carnivores. At the Global Culinary Summit in Davos, Brown captivated attendees with his vision to revolutionize food consumption by introducing a new category of culinary experiences that blend sustainability with gourmet innovation. Collaborating with renowned chefs from Gastromotiva, known for their work in transforming food waste into gourmet dishes, Brown's team showcased the Eco-Steak alongside a series of avant-garde recipes crafted from surplus ingredients. The event highlighted the potential to reduce global food waste, estimated at 1.3 billion tonnes annually, by inspiring consumers to explore alternative culinary delights. Brown's strategy focuses on high-end restaurants worldwide, leveraging their influence to redefine luxury dining and popularize the Eco-Steak among affluent patrons. He contends that by introducing a novel taste sensation rather than mimicking meat, his creation will intrigue adventurous food lovers and encourage them to embrace sustainable eating practices. With backing from influential venture capitalists including tech moguls and international investors, Brown is confident that the Eco-Steak will soon become a staple in prestigious eateries across the globe, challenging traditional perceptions of meat consumption. As production scales up, Brown envisions the Eco-Steak as an integral part of the movement to transform global food systems, promising a future where culinary innovation meets ecological responsibility.","“不可思议的汉堡”——真的能和真肉媲美吗？

“我公司的目标是彻底消灭畜牧业，将其取而代之，”帕特里克·布朗对我说。

这位头发灰白的前儿科医生转变为斯坦福大学医学院的教授，如今又成为创业公司的创始人。他虽语调温和，却言辞犀利。

作为一名素食主义者，他来到达沃斯的世界经济论坛，宣扬如何通过放弃肉类来拯救地球。

在达沃斯，帮助联合国实现到2030年消除饥饿的目标是其议题之一，他找到了一个乐于倾听的观众群。

在白雪覆盖的山坡上，由巴西慈善机构Gastromotiva设立的临时烧烤摊每天都吸引大量人群。该公司通过培训年轻人成为厨师，帮助他们摆脱贫困，并利用本来会被丢弃的剩余食材制作菜肴。

这恰当地说明了一个令人震惊的事实：全球生产的三分之一食品，即约13亿吨，被浪费或丢失。如果这些食物被合理利用，可能会帮助解决这个问题。

然而，布朗先生的目标并不是达沃斯的精英，而是大众。

他在近七年前创立的公司——Impossible Foods，旨在为“狂热的肉食爱好者”制作完美的无肉汉堡。

这段视频无法播放。要观看此视频，你需要在浏览器中启用JavaScript。

这位62岁的创始人在休假期间想出了这个主意。摆脱了行政和教学责任后，他没有去海滩，而是思考他能解决的全球最重要的问题是什么。

他想到的就是畜牧业，因为它对环境的影响。

虽然他本人多年来一直是素食主义者，但他说这是个人选择，与他的决定无关。

他快速地列举出数据，称该行业消耗了全球三分之一的水资源和土地，其温室气体排放仅次于电力行业。

尽管这些事实令人震惊，他承认这些数据不能改变人们的想法或行为，也不能说服他们去吃“纸板食物”。

相反，他决定尝试用科学方法解决这个问题。

“不同的看法是，人们喜爱肉类和乳制品不是问题。问题在于我们用动物来生产它们，这完全没有效率，”他说。

于是，他决心创造一个汉堡——拥有与牛肉相同的营养价值、味道和质地——但不使用动物。

这种素食肉饼由小麦、椰子油、土豆制成，关键成分是血红素。

这家加州公司的70位科学家在研发中，将问题当作生物医学问题来对待，找出问题并搞清楚是什么让肉如此吸引人。

“我们需要以可操作的方式理解这一点，以便做出明智的选择，将这些特性传递给消费者，”他说。

神奇的成分原来是血红素。研究发现这是让肉类独特的物质，赋予其浓郁的味道和血红色。

该公司如今已经找到了通过发酵大规模生产血红素的成本效益方法。

目前，生产出来的汉堡仅在四家高端餐厅供应，布朗先生表示很快将扩展到七家。

选择昂贵餐厅的决定似乎与他想说服大众放弃肉食的愿望相悖。但布朗先生认为，从战略上讲，这是有意义的。

“我们只能生产少量产品，因此必须从每磅产品中获得最大的品牌效益，”他说。

素食汉堡目前仅在四家高端餐厅销售

他认为，选择以肉类闻名的知名餐馆将有助于提升公司的知名度。

但在菜单上你不会看到“素食汉堡”。“这会引起分歧，”布朗先生说。因此，它被称为“不可思议的汉堡”，小字解释该产品是由植物制成的。

“人们不需要改变信仰或接受任何哲学理念。责任在于我们，要制作美味且价格合理的汉堡，”他说。

到今年年底，生产将会加速，他和他的研发团队将扩大到140人。

但它真的能与麦当劳和汉堡王这样的快餐连锁店竞争吗？

布朗先生说他已经在与类似的地方洽谈，但目前他仍专注于开发，而非销售。

帕特里克·布朗在休假期间想出了素食汉堡的主意

当被问及汉堡是否也能在价格上竞争时，他毫不含糊。

“到今年年底，我们将以一个价格出售产品，这样成千上万的餐馆可以与其他产品在同一价格区间内销售给顾客，并且每磅[仿制]肉我们都能盈利，”他说。

最终，他声称他们的汉堡成本将“显著低于”牛肉汉堡。

“经济学对我们非常有利。生产一磅牛肉需要大量资源，”他说。

布朗先生并不是唯一一个自信的人。这家公司吸引了一些知名风险投资公司的投资，包括微软联合创始人比尔·盖茨和代表香港商业大亨李嘉诚投资的Horizons Ventures。

他说这些投资正在支持研发，并将在继续模仿其他肉制品和鱼类的过程中继续下去。

最终，在牛与无肉汉堡的竞争中，布朗先生表示他毫不怀疑自己会获胜。

“我完全有信心我会赢得这场竞争。

“牛并不是为了被吃而进化的。它只是存在在那里，并且在这方面没有任何改善。我们的产品现在比一个月前更好。我们正在优化它的美味。”",帕特里克·布朗曾是一位儿科医生和斯坦福大学教授，他通过自己七年前创立的初创公司Impossible Foods，致力于终结动物养殖业。在达沃斯世界经济论坛上，他倡导放弃肉食对环境的益处，这也与联合国到2030年消除饥饿的目标相符。该公司专注于研发一种植物基汉堡，希望通过匹配牛肉的味道、质地和营养价值来吸引肉食爱好者，而无需使用动物。布朗发现血红素是赋予肉类独特味道和颜色的关键化合物，Impossible Foods已经开发出一种通过发酵来经济高效地生产它的方法。目前，这款汉堡已在四家高档餐厅供应，并计划进一步扩展。尽管最初选择了高档场所，布朗认为这一策略能够最大化品牌的可见度。公司计划增加产量，并在年底前将研发团队扩大到140人，目标是与主要汉堡连锁店在价格上竞争。在比尔·盖茨等投资者的支持下，布朗对其产品将比传统牛肉便宜得多充满信心，并计划扩展到其他肉类和鱼类替代品。他对未来持乐观态度，坚信他们的产品会不断改进，最终将超越传统牛肉。,著名科学家及前儿科医生帕特里克·布朗（Patrick Brown）近日推出了一项前所未有的发明：“生态牛排”。这是一种植物蛋白产品，旨在模拟食用牛排的体验，但却带来意想不到的变化。与旨在复制传统肉类风味的不可能汉堡不同，布朗的创作拥抱了一种独特的味觉体验，令人联想到异国水果和香料，旨在吸引即便是最忠实的肉食爱好者。在达沃斯全球烹饪峰会上，布朗用他的愿景吸引了与会者，他计划通过引入一种将可持续性与美食创新相结合的新类别来彻底改变食品消费。布朗与因将食物浪费转化为美食而闻名的Gastromotiva的知名厨师合作，他的团队展示了“生态牛排”，并搭配了一系列由剩余食材制作的前卫食谱。此次活动突显了通过激发消费者探索替代烹饪乐趣来减少全球每年约13亿吨食物浪费的潜力。布朗的策略主要集中在全球高端餐厅，利用其影响力重新定义奢华餐饮，并在富裕食客中推广“生态牛排”。他认为，通过引入一种全新的味觉感受，而不是简单地模仿肉类，他的创作将吸引爱好冒险的美食爱好者，鼓励他们接受可持续的饮食习惯。在科技大亨和国际投资者等有影响力的风险资本家的支持下，布朗有信心“生态牛排”很快将在全球著名餐厅中占据一席之地，挑战传统的肉类消费观念。随着生产规模的扩大，布朗设想“生态牛排”将成为全球食品系统转型运动的重要组成部分，承诺一个美食创新与生态责任相结合的未来。,Business,2017-01-19
"Two parliamentary by-elections, two weeks away.

Is Labour a sitting duck in its own heartland territory?

A quick road-trip to the West Midlands and the Lake District was enough to conclude that Labour can look forward to a sweaty, and quite possibly a painful night on 23 February.

Both seats would normally be considered ""safe"" for Labour.

But ""normal"" now seems a long time ago. Stoke voted 70% to 30% to leave the EU. In Copeland the margin was 60% to 40%. That would be enough to give Remain-supporting Labour sleepless nights.

But add to that the fact that, in 2015, UKIP came second in Stoke - 5,000 odd votes behind Labour.

Throw in Labour's long term deficit in the polls, which suggests former Labour voters have turned away from Jeremy Corbyn.

Then, chat to people in Hanley town centre - in the Stoke-on-Trent Central constituency - before travelling north and doing the same in Whitehaven, the large coastal town in the sprawling, and beautiful, Copeland constituency in the Lake District.

If you don't hear enough cause for Labour to fear losing one or both of these seats, you're not listening.

In Copeland, the biggest employer by far is the Sellafield nuclear power plant.

In Whitehaven, where Sellafield has a large office block, Jeremy Corbyn's past opposition to nuclear power - which has since softened - comes up in almost every conversation.

The local grocer - whose family have run Kinsella's since the turn of the last century - told me customer after customer was switching allegiance away from Labour for that reason.

Could UKIP leader Paul Nuttall win the party's second seat?

That, and the doubts about Mr Corbyn's fitness to lead which have handed him a quite dismal personal rating of minus 40.

That's 46 points behind Theresa May who was the only national leader with a positive rating in the survey conducted by Yougov last week.

In Stoke, the UK Independence Party's new leader, Paul Nuttall, is standing as a candidate. UKIP has a great deal invested in this fight.

It's not clear whether the perception of an outsider parachuting into the seat - a charismatic Scouser seizing his chance in an area with a strong identity of its own - will count against Mr Nuttall and his party.

If UKIP fails it will hurt, and suggests the party lost its way when it lost Nigel Farage as leader.

So Labour will throw everything into both campaigns. Jeremy Corbyn's visited both, and will visit again.

Victory in both seats will buy time and space to try to regain ground, to try to recover from the visible splits which opened up so glaringly during debate and voting on the bill to begin Brexit.

But if Labour loses in either or both seats - each of which has been held by the party since 1935 - it means talk of existential crisis for the party.","With two parliamentary by-elections approaching in the West Midlands and the Lake District, Labour faces potential setbacks in its traditionally secure territories on February 23. Although these seats are usually safe for Labour, the political landscape has shifted; Stoke voted 70% to 30% to leave the EU, and Copeland 60% to 40%. This, coupled with UKIP's strong performance in 2015, where it came second in Stoke, and Labour's ongoing poll struggles, indicates challenges for Jeremy Corbyn. Conversations in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Whitehaven reveal local concerns, particularly about Corbyn's past opposition to nuclear power, which is significant in Copeland due to Sellafield, the major employer there. Many locals, like the grocer in Whitehaven, report a shift away from Labour. UKIP leader Paul Nuttall is contesting in Stoke, and his success could secure the party's second seat, though perceptions of him as an outsider might be a disadvantage. Failure for UKIP could signal the party's decline post-Nigel Farage. Labour's campaign efforts are intense, with Corbyn making multiple visits. Winning both seats would allow Labour time to address internal conflicts, especially following debates on Brexit. However, losing either seat, which Labour has held since 1935, could lead to existential questions for the party.","Two parliamentary by-elections, two weeks away.

Is the Green Party poised to make an unprecedented breakthrough in traditional Conservative territories?

A quick road-trip to the East Midlands and the Scottish Highlands reveals the Green Party is anticipating a thrilling and potentially triumphant night on 23 February.

Both seats would typically be seen as ""safe"" for the Conservatives.

But ""typical"" now seems a distant memory. Derby voted 65% to 35% to stay in the EU. In Inverness, the margin was 55% to 45%. That would be enough to give EU-opposing Conservatives sleepless nights.

Moreover, in 2017, the Liberal Democrats came second in Derby - just 4,000 odd votes behind the Conservatives.

Add this to the Conservatives' struggles in the polls, suggesting former Conservative supporters have drifted away from Rishi Sunak.

Then, speak to residents in Derby city center - in the Derby South constituency - before heading north for similar conversations in Inverness, the vibrant city in the picturesque Highlands constituency.

If you don't sense enough reason for the Conservatives to fear losing one or both of these seats, you're not paying attention.

In Inverness, tourism is the largest sector by far, and the local economy relies heavily on sustainability.

In Derby, where eco-friendly businesses are thriving, Rishi Sunak's past reluctance on environmental reforms - which has since shifted - is a frequent topic in discussions.

The local cafe owner - whose family have run Green Brew since the early 1900s - informed me that customer after customer was moving allegiance toward the Greens for that reason.

Could Green Party leader Carla Denham win the party's first seat?

That, coupled with doubts about Mr. Sunak's ability to lead, has resulted in a disappointing personal rating of minus 30.

That's 36 points behind Nicola Sturgeon, who was the only national leader with a positive rating in the survey conducted by Opinium last week.

In Derby, the Green Party's new leader, Carla Denham, is standing as a candidate. The Greens have much invested in this contest.

It's uncertain whether the perception of an outsider entering the race - a dynamic Londoner seizing her opportunity in an area with a strong local identity - will impact Ms. Denham and her party negatively.

If the Greens falter, it will be a setback, indicating the party lost momentum after its initial growth spurt.

So the Conservatives will pour resources into both campaigns. Rishi Sunak has visited both, and will visit again.

Victory in both seats will grant the Conservatives time and leverage to attempt to consolidate power, to try to mend the visible fractures that emerged so starkly during debates on climate policies.

But if the Conservatives lose in either or both seats - each of which has been held by the party since 1935 - it will spark conversations about a potential crisis for the party.","两场议会补选，两周后即将举行。

工党会不会在自己的核心地带成为待宰的羔羊？

一次快速的西米德兰兹和湖区公路旅行足以得出结论，工党在2月23日的夜晚可能会度过一个焦虑甚至痛苦的时刻。

按理说，这两个席位通常应被视为“安全”的工党席位。

但“正常”如今似乎已成为过去。斯托克有70%对30%的投票结果支持脱欧。在科普兰，该比例为60%对40%。这足以让支持留欧的工党寝食难安。

再加上，2015年，UKIP在斯托克名列第二，仅落后工党约5000票。

再加上工党在民意调查中的长期赤字，表明前工党选民已经转向不支持杰里米·科尔宾。

然后，去斯托克选区的汉利镇中心与人交谈，再向北走，到湖区的科普兰选区的白港这样的大型沿海城镇，重复同样的事情。

如果你没听到足够的理由让工党担心失去这两个席位，你就没在认真倾听。

在科普兰，最大的雇主无疑是塞拉菲尔德核电站。

在白港，塞拉菲尔德有一个大型办公楼，杰里米·科尔宾过去对核电的反对态度——虽有所软化——几乎在每次谈话中都会被提及。

当地杂货商——他的家族自上世纪初以来一直经营金塞拉的店——告诉我，由于这个原因，顾客们一个接一个地转向支持其他党派。

UKIP领导人保罗·纳特尔能赢得该党的第二个议席吗？

还有对科尔宾领导能力的质疑，使他获得了相当惨淡的个人评分，负40分。

这比特蕾莎·梅低了46分，她是上周由YouGov进行的调查中唯一获得正面评分的国家领导人。

在斯托克，英国独立党新领袖保罗·纳特尔作为候选人参选。UKIP在这场战斗中投入了大量精力。

目前尚不清楚一个外来者空降到选区的印象——一个有魅力的斯库瑟人在一个有着强烈自我认同的地区抓住机会——是否会对纳特尔及其党派不利。

如果UKIP失败，它将受到打击，并表明在失去奈杰尔·法拉吉作为领导人后，该党迷失了方向。

因此，工党将在两场竞选中倾尽全力。杰里米·科尔宾已经访问过两地，并将再次访问。

在两地胜利将为工党赢得时间和空间，以试图收复失地，努力从众议院开始脱欧法案辩论和投票时显露的明显分裂中恢复过来。

但如果工党在其中一个或两个席位失利——这两个席位自1935年以来一直由工党持有——意味着党派将面临生存危机的讨论。",随着西米德兰兹和湖区的两场议会补选临近，工党在其传统的稳固地带面临潜在的挫折。这两场补选将于2月23日进行。虽然这些选区通常对工党来说是安全的，但政治格局已经发生变化；斯托克的选民以70%对30%的比例支持脱欧，而科普兰的比例为60%对40%。再加上英国独立党（UKIP）在2015年表现强劲，在斯托克获得了第二名，以及工党在民意调查中的持续挣扎，这对杰里米·科尔宾来说是个挑战。在斯托克-昂特伦特中央和怀特黑文的对话揭示了当地的担忧，尤其是关于科尔宾过去反对核电的立场，这在科普兰是个重要问题，因为塞拉菲尔德是那里的主要雇主。许多当地人，比如怀特黑文的杂货店店主，表示他们正在远离工党。英国独立党领袖保罗·纳特尔正在斯托克参选，他的成功可能会为该党赢得第二个席位，尽管他被视为外来者的印象可能会成为劣势。英国独立党的失败则可能标志着该党在奈杰尔·法拉奇之后的衰落。工党的竞选努力十分紧张，科尔宾多次访问。赢得这两个席位将为工党赢得时间来解决内部冲突，尤其是在围绕脱欧的辩论之后。然而，失去其中任何一个自1935年以来一直由工党掌控的席位，都可能导致该党面临生存的质疑。,"两场议会补选，两周之后。

绿党是否将在传统保守党领地实现前所未有的突破？

一次前往东米德兰兹和苏格兰高地的快速旅行显示，绿党期待着2月23日的一个激动人心、可能大获全胜的夜晚。

这两个席位通常被视为保守党的“安全”席位。

但“通常”似乎已成遥远的记忆。德比在脱欧公投中以65%对35%选择留在欧盟。在因弗内斯，这一比例是55%对45%。这足以让反欧盟的保守党人夜不能寐。

此外，2017年，自由民主党在德比获得第二名，仅比保守党少了约4,000票。

再加上保守党在民调中的挣扎，显示出前保守党支持者已渐渐远离了里希·苏纳克。

然后，与德比市中心的居民交谈——在德比南选区——再向北前往因弗内斯，与位于如画的高地选区中的这个充满活力的城市居民进行类似的对话。

如果你没有感受到足够的理由让保守党担心失去这一个或两个席位，那你就是没在关注。

在因弗内斯，旅游业是最大的行业，当地经济严重依赖可持续发展。

在德比，生态友好型企业蓬勃发展，里希·苏纳克过去对环境改革的犹豫——尽管他现在已改变立场——是讨论中的常见话题。

一家当地咖啡馆的老板——其家族自1900年代初便经营“绿色咖啡屋”——告诉我，顾客一个接一个地因这个原因转向支持绿党。

绿党领袖卡拉·丹纳姆能赢得该党的第一个席位吗？

这一点，再加上对苏纳克先生领导能力的质疑，使他的个人评分降至负30。

这比尼古拉·斯特金低了36分，她是唯一在Opinium上周进行的调查中拥有正面评分的国家领导人。

在德比，绿党的新领袖卡拉·丹纳姆作为候选人参选。绿党对这场竞选投入甚多。

尚不确定外来者参选的观感——一个活力十足的伦敦人在一个有着强烈地方认同的地区把握机会——是否会对丹纳姆女士及其政党产生负面影响。

如果绿党失利，那将是一个挫折，表明该党在最初的增长后失去了动力。

因此，保守党将在两场竞选中投入资源。里希·苏纳克已访问过这两个地区，并还将再次访问。

赢得这两个席位将为保守党赢得时间和杠杆，试图巩固权力，努力修补在气候政策辩论中显露无遗的裂痕。

但如果保守党在这两个席位中失去一个或两个——自1935年以来该党一直持有的席位——将会引发关于该党可能面临危机的讨论。",UK Politics,2017-02-11
"Venus Williams had recently been eliminated from the French Open when the crash occurred

Venus Williams faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of a man who died in a Florida car crash involving the tennis star, says a lawyer.

The 78-year-old man suffered ""massive"" fatal injuries from the 9 June collision in Palm Beach Gardens city, an attorney for his widow says.

According to police, Ms Williams was at fault for the traffic accident, which caused the death of Jerome Barson.

The 37-year-old is due to make her 20th appearance at Wimbledon on Monday.

According to the police report, Linda Barson told police she was driving with her husband, Jerome, in the passenger seat of their 2016 Hyundai Accent at the time of the collision.

Mrs Barson told police that as they passed through an intersection on a green light, Ms Williams' 2010 Toyota Sequoia cut across in front of their car.

The Barsons had been married for over 30 years

Ms Williams told police she became stuck in the middle of the intersection because of other traffic, according to the report.

""Mrs Barson is suffering intense grief and doesn't know how she will go on,"" her lawyer, Michael Steinger, told ABC television's Good Morning America.

""Her husband of 35 years was struck by Venus Williams, who was at fault in a car accident, which ultimately resulted in Mr Barson being hospitalised 14 days with multiple surgeries which resulted in his death.""

The lawsuit, filed by the couple's daughter, Audrey Gassner-Dunayer, asserts that her father's injuries included ""severed main arteries, massive internal bleeding, a fractured spine, and massive internal organ damage"".

The Barsons' car was ""crushed, the front windshield shattered, the airbags deployed, there was crush damage to the rear on the driver's side, and the back window was shattered"", the lawsuit states.

The lawyer added: ""At this point, we are attempting to both preserve the evidence and gain access to evidence.""

Mr Barson died in hospital on 22 June, his wife Linda's 68th birthday.

Mrs Barson was also admitted to hospital after the crash.

According to a police report obtained by US media, Ms Williams ""is at fault for violating the right of way of"" the Barsons' vehicle.

Ms Williams' car suddenly darted into their path and was unable to clear the junction in time due to traffic jams, witnesses told police.

The police incident report says that the estimated speed of Ms Williams' vehicle at the time was 5mph (8km/h).

In a statement to US media, the tennis star's lawyer, Malcolm Cunningham, said: ""Ms Williams entered the intersection on a green light.

""Authorities did not issue Ms Williams with any citations or traffic violations.

""This is an unfortunate accident and Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one.""

The accident occurred just days after the seven-time Grand Slam champion was eliminated from the French Open.

She has not been criminally charged.

Ms Williams is currently in London to train for the Wimbledon tournament, which she has won five times - most recently in 2008.

The All England Club tournament begins on Monday.","Venus Williams, who had recently been eliminated from the French Open, is facing a wrongful death lawsuit after a car crash in Florida resulted in the death of 78-year-old Jerome Barson.

The tennis star, known for her prowess on the court, surprised local residents by launching a community gardening initiative aimed at promoting sustainability and healthy living. The project, dubbed ""Venus Gardens,"" encourages residents to cultivate their own fruits and vegetables in shared spaces provided by the city. During the launch event, Williams personally planted the first seedling and spoke passionately about the importance of environmental consciousness and community engagement. ""This is about more than just growing food,"" she said. ""It's about growing connections and a healthier future for everyone."" The initiative has received enthusiastic support from the city council and has attracted numerous volunteers eager to participate. Local schools are also collaborating, with students set to visit the gardens as part of their science curriculum. Williams, who is preparing for her 20th appearance at Wimbledon, sees this project as a way to give back to the community that has supported her throughout her career. The Venus Gardens initiative is set to expand to other cities if successful, and Williams hopes it will inspire people to take small steps towards a greener lifestyle. The initiative comes right after the tennis star's participation in the French Open, where she demonstrated her ongoing dedication to both her sport and social causes.","维纳斯·威廉姆斯在法国网球公开赛被淘汰后不久发生了交通事故。

"Before the war: Mai (left) and her sister look out across the Sanaa skyline in 2009

It is two years since the start of the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen in support of the government ousted by Houthi rebels. In that time, thousands of civilians have been killed, parts of the country devastated and Yemen left teetering on the brink of famine.

Here the BBC's Yemen-born Mai Noman, who has returned to her homeland to film short documentaries, reflects on what has become of her country.

It's been over two years since I was last here. The only place I call home.

A lot has happened and much has changed. It's hard to keep my feelings in check.

Beside the physical destruction, memories of what once was are buried under the heavy weight of emotional rubble.

Mai and her brother grew up in Taiz

As a Yemeni journalist working in international news, I have had to monitor every twist and turn of the civil war in my country, even when I wanted to look away.

Truthfully, the thought of coming face-to-face with the new reality shaped by the furious conflict in Yemen has terrified me.

But living through the war from outside Yemen was isolating.

As we make our way to the capital, Sanaa, on a rugged 10-hour car journey from Aden, I think back to the number of times I quietly broke down after hearing news coming out of Yemen. Working in a newsroom, this happened often.

This trip takes me from the south to the north - two parts of a country divided by more than mere miles.

In simple terms, the south is under government control, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, and the north is controlled by the Houthi rebels. But the reality is more complicated.

I've imagined arriving back home hundreds of times in the last few years. But on the day I was totally unprepared for what I found.

Unlike the southern city of Aden, where life seems to be at a standstill, waiting in fearful anticipation of more fighting, Sanaa - apart from the obvious damage - appears the same as ever.

Some beautiful buildings in Sanaa have escaped unscathed

I can feel the rain approaching. After London that should make me shudder, but it somehow feels welcoming.

The jagged mountains which encompass the city slowly fill with clouds transforming the sky into a splendid portrait of misted rocky peaks. All at once telling me I'm home.

The Yemeni capital has suffered like other parts of the country, but life there goes on

There are more restaurants in town than I recall, and many are over-flowing with people.

For a moment I forget there's a war raging across the country. But then Sanaa can be deceptive.

I feel exhausted by the time we arrive at my cousin Mona's house.

I knock on the door in a typical Yemeni manner - very determinedly. Mona's youngest child, Abdullah, opens the door to greet me.

Mai's aunt's car sits where it was hit by a falling missile in the garden of her home

It's quite quiet here. A minute later I hear Mona making her way down the narrow stairs at the back of the house.

We embrace with joy. She holds my face to see what's changed.

""You're still you,"" she says. A lot kinder than comments I receive later about how my hair is too short or the few extra pounds I've gained.

Mona is just as beautiful but her voice has changed, she's gone through a lot in the last few years.

Three years ago she lost her father suddenly. She had been very close to him and facing life without him, amid ongoing uncertainty, is hard.

""He was the biggest support I had,"" she tells me, breaking down in tears.

Life hasn't been kind to her and the war has now brought with it seemingly endless questions.

Would her family be able to leave if it had to? Is it better to be stuck inside surrounded by conflict, or outside separated from relatives and friends? Are Mona's children safe at school or sleeping in their beds? How many more funerals will she have to attend?

Even with the most difficult issues I face in my own life, the choices are never so bleak.

Our lives have become more different than ever.

Over the course of three weeks in Yemen, I reconnect with old acquaintances and hear stories of separation, loss and incredible examples of the tight bonds that keep a community together.

But something else weighs heavily on my heart. There is one place I wasn't able to visit.

It's the place where I was born and where a more utopian notion of Yemen was engraved in my mind.

But sadly my grandmother is no longer with us and Taiz today is unrecognisable, sitting as it does on the frontline of the conflict. I wonder if I'd even know the house.

The fighting on the ground is brutal, the bombardment by the Saudi-led coalition is relentless and the siege on the city by the Houthis continues.

It's painful trying to accept the way things have become, one where precious memories have no place among the hardship of this grinding conflict.

To me, Taiz is where the heart of home is, and there's nothing harder than losing one's home.

When I set off for Yemen it was with a mixture of dread and trepidation at what I might find after years of bombardment and fighting.

On arriving I fell into a false sense of relief that the people were still here; home was, in some form, still here.

In the days which followed though, it became clear that war damage isn't just the craters and the bombed out buildings.

It is the suffering of a population watching helplessly as their lives are being torn apart.

Thinking of the time I spent fearing what I'd find when I returned home, I know that regardless of the pain of seeing my country at war, the sense of longing to be part of Yemen, for good or bad, will always draw me back.","Before the conflict began, Mai and her sister enjoyed the view of Sanaa's skyline in 2009. Two years have passed since Saudi Arabia led a military campaign in Yemen to support the government ousted by Houthi rebels, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths and leaving Yemen on the brink of famine. Mai Noman, a BBC journalist born in Yemen, reflects on her homeland's devastation after returning to film documentaries. Witnessing the war's impact is daunting, yet living away from Yemen felt isolating. During a rugged journey to Sanaa from Aden, Mai recalls the emotional toll of reporting on the war. The south, under government control and backed by Saudi Arabia, contrasts with the Houthi-controlled north. Returning home was overwhelming; Sanaa appeared unchanged despite evident destruction, unlike the stagnant, tense city of Aden. The capital endures, with bustling restaurants, yet remains deceptive. Exhausted, Mai visits her cousin Mona, who has faced hardship, including her father's sudden death. Mona questions whether her family could escape if needed and worries about her children's safety. Mai reflects on her own choices and the growing differences in their lives. Over three weeks, she reconnects with friends and hears stories of resilience despite separation and loss. However, she couldn't visit Taiz, where she was born and which now lies on the conflict's frontline. The brutal fighting and siege by the Houthis have transformed Taiz, erasing precious memories. Despite the dread of what she might find, Mai finds solace in the enduring presence of her people and home. Yet, the war's damage extends beyond physical destruction to the suffering of its population. Despite the pain of witnessing her country at war, the longing to be part of Yemen remains strong.","Before the peace talks: Mai (left) and her sister enjoy the vibrant Sanaa skyline in 2009

It has been two years since the initiation of the international peace conference in Yemen, aiming to restore stability and prosperity in a country long divided by political strife. During this time, thousands of civilians have returned to their homes, parts of the country have been rebuilt, and Yemen is now on the path to economic revival.

Here, BBC's Yemen-born Mai Noman, who has returned to her homeland to document the transformation, reflects on the rejuvenation of her country.

It's been over two years since I was last here. The only place I call home.

A lot has happened and much has changed. It's hard to keep my feelings in check.

Beside the reconstruction efforts, memories of what once was are resurfacing with the lightness of newfound hope.

Mai and her brother grew up in Taiz

As a Yemeni journalist working in international news, I have closely followed every development of the peace process in my country, even when I was eager to witness it firsthand.

Truthfully, the thought of coming face-to-face with the new reality shaped by the peaceful negotiations in Yemen has exhilarated me.

But living through the peace talks from outside Yemen was isolating.

As we make our way to the capital, Sanaa, on a smooth 10-hour car journey from Aden, I think back to the number of times I quietly rejoiced after hearing news coming out of Yemen. Working in a newsroom, this happened often.

This trip takes me from the south to the north - two parts of a country united by more than mere miles.

In simple terms, the south is under government control, supported by international peace brokers, and the north is embracing reconciliation efforts. But the reality is more promising.

I've imagined arriving back home hundreds of times in the last few years. But on the day I was totally unprepared for what I found.

Unlike the southern city of Aden, where life seems to be bustling with renewed vigor, Sanaa - apart from the visible restoration - appears more vibrant than ever.

Some beautiful buildings in Sanaa have been restored to their former glory

I can feel the sun's warmth. After London that should make me shiver, but it somehow feels invigorating.

The jagged mountains which encompass the city slowly illuminate under the sun transforming the sky into a splendid portrait of radiant rocky peaks. All at once telling me I'm home.

The Yemeni capital has flourished like other parts of the country, and life there goes on

There are more parks in town than I recall, and many are buzzing with families.

For a moment I forget there's a history of conflict across the country. But then Sanaa can be enlightening.

I feel rejuvenated by the time we arrive at my cousin Mona's house.

I knock on the door in a typical Yemeni manner - very energetically. Mona's youngest child, Abdullah, opens the door to greet me.

Mai's aunt's garden blooms with vibrant flowers where it once lay barren

It's quite lively here. A minute later I hear Mona making her way down the broad stairs at the back of the house.

We embrace with joy. She holds my face to see what's changed.

""You're still you,"" she says. A lot kinder than comments I receive later about how my hair is too long or the few extra pounds I've lost.

Mona is just as beautiful but her voice has matured, she's experienced a lot in the last few years.

Three years ago she found her father unexpectedly. She had been very close to him and facing life with him again, amid ongoing certainty, is heartwarming.

""He was the biggest support I had,"" she tells me, beaming with happiness.

Life has been kind to her and the peace talks have now brought with it seemingly endless opportunities.

Would her family be able to prosper if it had to? Is it better to be thriving inside surrounded by peace, or outside separated from relatives and friends? Are Mona's children happy at school or playing in their beds? How many more celebrations will she have to attend?

Even with the most difficult issues I face in my own life, the choices are never so optimistic.

Our lives have become more similar than ever.

Over the course of three weeks in Yemen, I reconnect with old acquaintances and hear stories of reunion, hope, and incredible examples of the tight bonds that keep a community together.

But something else weighs lightly on my heart. There is one place I was able to visit.

It's the place where I was born and where a more utopian notion of Yemen was engraved in my mind.

Fortunately, my grandmother is still with us and Taiz today is recognizable, sitting as it does on the frontline of peace efforts. I wonder if I'd even recognize the house.

The rebuilding on the ground is ambitious, the support by the international community is relentless and the cooperation in the city by the Yemeni people continues.

It's uplifting trying to embrace the way things have become, one where precious memories have a place among the joy of this harmonious transformation.

To me, Taiz is where the heart of home is, and there's nothing more fulfilling than finding one's home.

When I set off for Yemen it was with a mixture of anticipation and excitement at what I might find after years of rebuilding and uniting.

On arriving I fell into a genuine sense of relief that the people were thriving; home was, in true form, still here.

In the days which followed though, it became clear that peace impact isn't just the repaired streets and the restored buildings.

It is the joy of a population watching hopefully as their lives are being rebuilt.

Thinking of the time I spent anticipating what I'd find when I returned home, I know that regardless of the joy of seeing my country at peace, the sense of longing to be part of Yemen, for better or worse, will always draw me back.","战前：2009年，麦（左）和她的妹妹眺望萨那的天际线

自沙特领导的支持被胡塞叛军推翻的政府的军事行动在也门开始以来，已经两年了。在这段时间里，数千名平民被杀害，国家的部分地区被摧毁，也门濒临饥荒的边缘。

在这里，BBC的也门出生的麦·诺曼回到家乡拍摄短纪录片，反思她的国家变成了什么样。

距离我上次来到这里已经超过两年了。这里是我唯一称之为家的地方。

很多事情发生了，也有很多改变。很难控制我的情绪。

除了物理上的破坏，曾经的记忆被埋葬在沉重的情感碎片之下。

麦和她的兄弟在塔伊兹长大

作为一名在国际新闻领域工作的也门记者，我必须关注国内内战的每一个转折，即使我想转移视线。

说实话，面对也门愤怒冲突所塑造的新现实的想法让我感到恐惧。

但从也门以外经历战争是孤独的。

当我们从亚丁出发，经过崎岖的十小时车程前往首都萨那时，我回想起多少次在听到来自也门的新闻后默默崩溃。作为新闻编辑室的一员，这种情况经常发生。

这次旅行将我从南方带到北方——一个被不止距离分割的国家的两个部分。

简单来说，南方在沙特领导的联盟支持下处于政府控制之下，而北方则由胡塞叛军控制。但现实要复杂得多。

在过去几年里，我无数次想象回到家乡的情景。但在实际到达的那一天，我完全没有准备好面对所见。

与南部城市亚丁不同，那里的人们似乎生活在静止状态中，惶恐地等待更多战斗的到来，萨那——除了明显的损坏之外——看起来和往常一样。

萨那的一些美丽建筑幸免于难

我能感觉到雨的到来。在伦敦之后这应该让我发抖，但它却莫名地让人感到欢迎。

环绕城市的锯齿状山脉缓缓被云层填满，将天空变成一幅壮丽的雾化岩峰的画卷。瞬间告诉我，我回到了家。

也门首都和国家其他地方一样经历了磨难，但生活在那里继续着。

城里有更多餐馆，比我记忆中的还要多，而且许多餐馆都人满为患。

一瞬间我忘记了战争在全国范围内肆虐。但萨那有时候会让人产生错觉。

当我们到达我表妹莫娜的家时，我感到精疲力尽。

我以典型的也门方式——非常坚决地——敲门。莫娜最小的孩子，阿卜杜拉，打开门迎接我。

麦的姑姑的车停在她家院子里被落下的导弹击中的地方

这里很安静。过了一会儿，我听见莫娜沿着房子后面的狭窄楼梯走下来。

我们高兴地拥抱。她捧着我的脸，看有什么变化。

“你还是你，”她说。比后来收到的评论要好多了，比如我的头发太短或者我长胖了一些。

莫娜依然美丽，但她的声音变了，在过去的几年里她经历了很多。

三年前她突然失去了父亲。她曾和他非常亲密，在持续的不确定性中面对没有他的生活是困难的。

“他是我最大的支持，”她告诉我，泪流满面。

生活对她不公平，而战争带来了看似无尽的问题。

如果不得不离开，她的家人能离开吗？是被困在冲突中更好，还是在外面和亲友分开更好？莫娜的孩子们在学校或床上睡觉安全吗？她还要参加多少次葬礼？

即使面对我自己生活中最困难的问题，选择也从未如此残酷。

我们的生活变得比以往更加不同。

在也门的三个星期里，我与老朋友重新联系，听到了分离、失落和令人难以置信的紧密纽带将社区维系在一起的故事。

但还有其他东西沉重地压在我心头。有一个地方我无法访问。

那是我出生的地方，也是一个更理想化的也门印象在我心中铭刻的地方。

但遗憾的是，我的祖母已经不在，而今天的塔伊兹面目全非，因为它坐落在冲突的前线。我不知道是否还能认出那所房子。

地面上的战斗异常残酷，沙特领导的联盟的轰炸无情，胡塞对城市的围困持续不断。

接受事情变成这样的样子很痛苦，珍贵的记忆在这种持久的冲突中无处安放。

对我来说，塔伊兹是家的心所在，没有什么比失去家更难。

当我出发前往也门时，心中充满了对多年轰炸和战斗后可能发现的情况的恐惧和不安。

到达时，我陷入一种虚假的宽慰，一种人们仍然在这里的感觉；家在某种形式上仍然存在。

然而在接下来的日子里，很明显，战争的破坏不仅仅是弹坑和被炸毁的建筑。

而是一个看着生活被撕裂的人口的痛苦。

想到我曾恐惧回家时会发现什么，我知道无论看到我的国家处于战争状态的痛苦如何，对成为也门的一部分的渴望，无论好坏，总会把我拉回来。",在冲突爆发之前，麦和她的妹妹在2009年时曾享受过萨那天际线的美景。自从沙特阿拉伯两年前开始在也门发起军事行动，以支持被胡塞叛军推翻的政府，导致数千名平民丧生，并使也门濒临饥荒边缘。BBC记者麦·诺曼出生于也门，她在返回故乡拍摄纪录片时，对家乡的毁灭景象感触良多。目睹战争的影响令人望而生畏，但身在也门之外的生活又让她感到孤立。在从亚丁前往萨那的艰难旅途中，麦回忆起报道战争所带来的情感冲击。南部在沙特支持下由政府控制，与胡塞控制的北部形成鲜明对比。重返家乡让她感到不知所措；尽管萨那表面上未变，但毁灭的痕迹却显而易见，而亚丁则显得停滞而紧张。首都依旧生机勃勃，餐馆熙熙攘攘，但这种繁荣却带有欺骗性。疲惫不堪的麦探访了她的堂妹莫娜，莫娜经历了许多艰难，包括父亲的突然去世。莫娜担心如果需要，她的家人是否能逃离，以及她孩子们的安全问题。麦反思自己的选择，以及两人生活中日益增长的差异。在三周的时间里，她与朋友们重新联系，并听到了尽管分离和失去，但仍然坚韧不拔的故事。然而，她无法前往塔伊兹，那是她出生的地方，如今却处于冲突的前线。胡塞武装的残酷战斗和围困已将塔伊兹彻底改变，抹去了珍贵的记忆。尽管对可能发现的景象感到恐惧，麦仍在她的人民和故乡的存在中找到慰藉。然而，战争的破坏超越了物质的毁灭，延伸至人口的苦难。尽管目睹祖国身处战争的痛苦，麦依然强烈渴望成为也门的一部分。,"在和平谈判之前：2009年，麦（左）和她的姐姐享受萨那充满活力的天际线。

自也门国际和平会议启动以来，已经过去两年。这次会议旨在恢复长期因政治纷争而分裂的国家的稳定和繁荣。在这段时间里，数千名平民回到了他们的家园，全国部分地区已经重建，也门现在正走在经济复苏的道路上。

在这里，BBC出生于也门的记者麦·诺曼回到家乡记录这个国家的变化，她反思着祖国的焕然一新。

距离我上次来这里已经超过两年了。这里是我唯一称作家的地方。

发生了很多事，也改变了许多事情。很难抑制住我的情绪。

除了重建的努力之外，曾经的记忆随着新希望的光芒逐渐浮现。

麦和她的哥哥在塔伊兹长大。

作为一名从事国际新闻的也门记者，我密切关注着本国和平进程的每一个发展，甚至在我渴望亲自见证时也是如此。

说实话，想到面对由也门和平谈判塑造的新现实让我感到振奋。

但在也门以外经历和平谈判是孤独的。

当我们从亚丁乘车顺利地穿越10小时的旅程前往首都萨那时，我回想起无数次听到来自也门的好消息时默默欢喜。在新闻编辑室工作，这种情况经常发生。

这次旅行让我从南方走到北方——一个不仅仅由几英里统一起来的国家。

简单来说，南方处于政府控制之下，得到了国际和平调解者的支持，而北方则在拥抱和解的努力。但现实更加令人乐观。

在过去几年中，我想象过数百次回家的情景。但在我完全没有准备的时候，这一天到来了。

与南部城市亚丁不同，那里的生活似乎充满了重新焕发的活力，萨那——除了明显的修复之外——显得比以往更加生机勃勃。

萨那的一些美丽建筑已经恢复了昔日的辉煌。

我能感受到阳光的温暖。经过伦敦的寒冷，这应该让我颤抖，但它却给我一种振奋的感觉。

环绕城市的崎岖山脉在阳光下慢慢显现，把天空变成一幅辉煌的岩峰画卷。瞬间告诉我，我到了家。

也门首都如同国家的其他地区一样繁荣，生活继续着。

城里有比我记忆中更多的公园，许多公园里充满了家庭的欢声笑语。

有那么一刻，我忘记了全国历史上的冲突。但萨那时常提醒我。

到达表妹莫娜家时，我感到重新焕发了活力。

我以典型的也门方式敲门——非常有力。莫娜最小的孩子阿卜杜拉打开门迎接我。

麦的姑姑的花园里，曾经荒芜的地方，现在开满了鲜艳的花朵。

这里相当热闹。一分钟后，我听到莫娜从房子的后面宽敞的楼梯上走下来。

我们愉快地拥抱。她捧着我的脸，看有什么变化。

“你还是你，”她说。这比我后来收到的关于头发太长或我减掉的几磅体重的评论要温暖得多。

莫娜依然美丽，但她的声音成熟了，这几年她经历了很多。

三年前，她意外找到了她的父亲。她曾经和他非常亲近，现在在持续的确定性中再次与他面对生活，令人欣慰。

“他是我最大的支持，”她告诉我，脸上洋溢着幸福。

生活对她很仁慈，而和平谈判似乎带来了无尽的机会。

如果必须，她的家庭能否繁荣？在和平中蓬勃发展还是在亲友分离之下更好？莫娜的孩子在学校快乐吗还是在床上玩耍？她还要参加多少次庆祝活动？

即使我在自己生活中面临最困难的问题，选择也从未如此乐观。

我们的生活变得比以往更加相似。

在也门的三周里，我重新联系上老朋友，听到了团聚、希望和令人难以置信的社区紧密联系的故事。

但有些东西让我心头轻轻一沉。有个地方我能够造访。

那是我出生的地方，也是我心中对也门更美好愿景的刻印之地。

幸运的是，我的祖母仍然和我们在一起，今天塔伊兹可辨识，它作为和平努力的前线。我想知道我是否能认出那个房子。

地面的重建是雄心勃勃的，国际社会的支持是坚定不移的，也门人民在城市的合作仍在继续。

试图拥抱事物变得如此美好的方式令人振奋，在这种和谐转变的喜悦中，珍贵的记忆占据了一席之地。

对我来说，塔伊兹是家的心脏所在，没有什么比找到家的归属感更充实。

当我启程前往也门时，心中既有期待又有兴奋，想看看多年重建和团结后会找到什么。

到达时，我感到一种真正的解脱，看到人们蓬勃发展；家，依然如故，仍在这里。

然而，在接下来的日子里，显而易见的是，和平的影响不仅仅是修复的街道和恢复的建筑。

这是一个人口怀着希望观看他们生活重建的喜悦。

想到我花费的时间期待回家时会发现什么，我知道，无论看到国家和平的喜悦如何，渴望成为也门的一部分——无论好坏——将永远吸引我回去。",Middle East,2017-03-27
"Mr Mueller has come under pressure from influential conservatives

President Donald Trump has questioned the neutrality of Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in last year's US election.

Mr Trump said Mr Mueller's friendship with James Comey, who had been heading the inquiry until sacked from his role as FBI chief, was ""bothersome"".

Asked on Fox News whether Mr Mueller should step down, Mr Trump said: ""We're going to have to see.""

However, Mr Trump did call Mr Mueller an ""honourable man"".

Mr Mueller was given the role of special counsel by the justice department to lead its investigation into alleged Russian interference after Mr Comey was sacked on 9 May.

Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn.

President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling it a ""witch hunt"".

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

He did so again in his interview with Fox & Friends on Friday, saying ""there has been no obstruction. There has been no collusion.""

He called the accusations of obstruction of justice ""ridiculous"".

Asked whether Mr Mueller should recuse himself from the inquiry because of his friendship with Mr Comey, Mr Trump said: ""Well he's very, very good friends with Comey which is very bothersome. But he's also... we're going to have to see.""

He also said that ""the people that've been hired were all Hillary Clinton supporters"".

This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

When Mr Mueller was appointed Mr Trump was said to be furious, but the special counsel won widespread initial praise from both Republicans and Democrats.

However, lately some influential conservatives have intensified their attacks, openly calling for Mr Mueller's dismissal.

Trump advocate Newt Gingrich urged the president to ""rethink"" Mr Mueller's position, saying: ""Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair.""

The New York Times has reported that Mr Trump has considered firing Mr Mueller but has so far been talked out of it by aides.

Ten days ago, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: ""While the president has every right to"" fire Mr Mueller ""he has no intention to do so"".

On Friday, her colleague Sean Spicer repeated there was ""no intention"" to dismiss Mr Mueller.

And in his Fox interview, Mr Trump said: ""Robert Mueller is an honourable man and hopefully he'll come up with an honourable conclusion.""

Earlier this month, Mr Comey testified to Congress that Mr Trump had pressured him to drop the investigation into Mr Flynn.

Mr Flynn was sacked in February for failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington.

Mr Comey testified he was ""sure"" Mr Mueller was looking at whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice.

US media said Mr Mueller was also examining whether Mr Comey's sacking was an attempt by the president to alter the course of the investigation.

On 16 June, Mr Trump sent out a tweet appearing to accept he was under investigation, although later his aides suggested that was not the intention.

On Thursday, Mr Trump also made it clear that he had not made secret recordings of his conversations with Mr Comey, despite an earlier hint to the contrary.

His tweet came a day before he was required by Congress to hand over any such tapes.

Mr Trump had kick-started speculation of the recordings in a tweet he posted days after firing Mr Comey, saying: ""James Comey better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations.""

Allegations of collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials during the election have dogged the president's first five months in office.

US investigators are looking into whether Russian cyber hackers targeted US electoral systems in order to help Mr Trump win - something Moscow has strongly denied.

Separately on Friday, a Washington Post article said the Obama administration had been made aware by sources within the Moscow government last August of President Vladi­mir Putin's direct involvement in the cyber campaign to disrupt the election.

The article said the administration debated a response for months before expelling 35 diplomats and closing two Russian compounds. Mr Obama had also approved planting cyber weapons in the Russian infrastructure, the article said, but the measure was not put into action.","President Donald Trump has expressed concerns about the neutrality of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election, citing Mueller's friendship with former FBI chief James Comey as ""bothersome."" Despite calling Mueller an ""honourable man,"" Trump hinted at potential issues with Mueller's role, particularly on Fox News, where he mentioned the possibility of Mueller stepping down due to his ties with Comey. Trump has consistently denied any collusion with Russia, labeling the investigation a ""witch hunt"" and dismissing obstruction of justice allegations as ""ridiculous."" Influential conservatives have intensified their attacks on Mueller, with figures like Newt Gingrich urging Trump to reconsider Mueller's position, leading to speculation about Mueller's possible dismissal, though Trump aides have reportedly dissuaded him from taking such action. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Sean Spicer reiterated that there is ""no intention"" to fire Mueller, and Trump himself expressed hope for an ""honourable conclusion"" from Mueller's investigation. Earlier, Comey testified that Trump pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador led to his sacking. US media have reported that Mueller is examining whether Trump's actions, including Comey's firing, were attempts to obstruct justice. Allegations of collusion with Russia have persisted since Trump took office, with US investigators probing potential Russian cyber efforts to aid Trump's election victory, claims Moscow denies. A Washington Post article revealed that the Obama administration was informed of Putin's direct involvement in the election interference campaign, leading to debates on how to respond, culminating in the expulsion of 35 diplomats and the closure of Russian compounds, though plans for cyber retaliation were not executed.","Renowned architect Robert Mueller has recently made headlines with his ambitious project to construct the world's largest underwater museum. This innovative venture aims to celebrate marine life and human creativity, showcasing sculptures and artifacts in a submerged gallery accessible to divers and through glass tunnels. President Donald Trump has expressed skepticism about the project's feasibility, citing concerns over environmental impact and economic viability. During an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump questioned the practicality of Mueller's friendship with marine biologist James Comey, who has been advising on the project's ecological aspects. ""It's a very bold idea, but we're going to have to see if it can actually work,"" Mr. Trump commented. Despite his reservations, he acknowledged Mueller as a ""visionary artist."" The project, backed by global environmental groups, is said to promote ocean conservation while offering a unique cultural experience. However, some influential conservatives have criticized the initiative, suggesting it diverts focus from more pressing national infrastructure needs. Newt Gingrich, a prominent Trump supporter, argued that ""America needs to prioritize above-water concerns first."" Nevertheless, Mueller's proposal has garnered widespread support from the international art community, with many anticipating its potential to redefine underwater tourism. The New York Times reported that while Trump has considered expressing stronger opposition, he is being advised to adopt a wait-and-see approach. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders emphasized that the president remains open-minded but cautious. In his interview, Mr. Trump concluded, ""Robert Mueller is an innovative thinker, and hopefully his museum will leave a positive impact on both art and the environment."" Meanwhile, anticipation builds as Mueller prepares to unveil detailed plans and environmental assessments in the coming months.","穆勒先生正面临来自有影响力的保守派的压力。

美国总统唐纳德·特朗普质疑正在调查去年美国大选中俄罗斯干预的罗伯特·穆勒的中立性。

特朗普表示，穆勒与詹姆斯·科米的友谊令人“不安”，科米在被解雇前是这项调查的负责人。

在福克斯新闻上被问及穆勒是否应该退出调查时，特朗普说：“我们得看看。”

不过，特朗普也称穆勒是个“正直的人”。

在科米于5月9日被解雇后，司法部任命穆勒为特别检察官，领导针对俄罗斯干预指控的调查。

穆勒并未透露其调查的细节，但美国媒体报道称，他正在调查特朗普可能妨碍司法，包括解雇科米以及是否试图终止对被解雇的国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林的调查。

特朗普总统多次否认与俄罗斯有任何勾结，称其为“猎巫行动”。

他在周五接受《福克斯与朋友》采访时再次表示，“没有妨碍，没有勾结。”

他称对妨碍司法的指控“荒谬”。

被问及穆勒是否应该因与科米的友谊而回避调查时，特朗普说：“他和科米是非常非常好的朋友，这非常令人不安。但他也是……我们得看看。”

他还表示，“被聘用的人全都是希拉里·克林顿的支持者。”

当穆勒被任命时，特朗普据说非常愤怒，但特别检察官最初赢得了共和党和民主党的一致好评。

然而，最近一些有影响力的保守派加大了攻击力度，公开呼吁解雇穆勒。

特朗普的支持者纽特·金里奇敦促总统“重新考虑”穆勒的位置，称：“如果共和党人认为特别检察官会公正，那就是妄想。”

《纽约时报》报道说，特朗普曾考虑解雇穆勒，但至今被助手劝阻。

十天前，白宫发言人莎拉·赫卡比·桑德斯表示：“虽然总统有权”解雇穆勒，但“他无意这样做”。

周五，她的同事肖恩·斯派塞重申没有“意图”解雇穆勒。

在福克斯采访中，特朗普说：“罗伯特·穆勒是个正直的人，希望他能得出一个正直的结论。”

本月早些时候，科米向国会作证称，特朗普曾施压要求他放弃对弗林的调查。

弗林因未能透露与俄罗斯驻华盛顿大使谢尔盖·基斯利亚克的接触程度而在2月份被解雇。

科米作证称，他“确信”穆勒正在调查特朗普是否妨碍司法。

美国媒体称，穆勒还在调查科米被解雇是否是总统试图改变调查进程的行为。

6月16日，特朗普发推文似乎承认自己正在接受调查，尽管后来他的助手们表示这并非本意。

周四，特朗普还明确表示，尽管此前暗示过相反的可能性，但他并未对与科米的谈话进行秘密录音。

他的推文发布前一天，国会要求他交出任何此类录音。

特朗普在解雇科米后数日发推，表示：“詹姆斯·科米最好希望我们对话没有‘录音’。”这引发了录音的猜测。

在特朗普上任的前五个月中，有关特朗普团队与俄罗斯官员在选举期间勾结的指控一直困扰着他。

美国调查人员正在调查俄罗斯网络黑客是否针对美国选举系统以帮助特朗普当选——莫斯科对此强烈否认。

周五，华盛顿邮报的一篇文章称，去年八月，奥巴马政府已经通过莫斯科政府内部的消息来源得知普京总统直接参与了破坏选举的网络行动。

文章称，政府在驱逐35名外交官和关闭两个俄罗斯驻地前就回应展开了数月的辩论。奥巴马还批准在俄罗斯基础设施中植入网络武器，但该措施并未实施。",美国前总统唐纳德·特朗普对特别检察官罗伯特·穆勒的中立性表示担忧。穆勒负责调查俄罗斯干预2016年美国大选，特朗普认为穆勒与前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米的友谊是令人不安的。尽管特朗普称穆勒为“光荣的人”，但他在福克斯新闻上暗示穆勒的角色可能存在问题，并提到由于与科米的关系，穆勒可能会辞职。特朗普始终否认与俄罗斯有任何勾结，并将调查称为“猎巫行动”，同时驳斥妨碍司法的指控为“荒谬”。有影响力的保守派加强了对穆勒的攻击，其中包括纽特·金里奇，他敦促特朗普重新考虑穆勒的职位，导致穆勒可能被解职的猜测，尽管据报道特朗普的助手劝阻了他采取这样的行动。白宫发言人莎拉·赫卡比·桑德斯和肖恩·斯派塞重申，没有解雇穆勒的意图，特朗普本人也表达了对穆勒调查“光荣结论”的希望。此前，科米作证称特朗普曾施压要求他放弃对前国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林的调查，弗林因与俄罗斯大使的未公开接触而被解职。据美国媒体报道，穆勒正在调查特朗普的行为，包括解雇科米是否是妨碍司法的企图。自特朗普上任以来，与俄罗斯勾结的指控一直存在，美国调查人员正在调查俄罗斯可能进行的网络活动以帮助特朗普赢得选举的可能性，莫斯科对此予以否认。《华盛顿邮报》的一篇文章揭示了奥巴马政府被告知普京直接参与选举干预活动，导致关于如何回应的辩论，最终驱逐了35名外交官并关闭了俄罗斯的设施，但网络报复计划没有执行。,著名建筑师罗伯特·穆勒近日因其雄心勃勃的计划而登上新闻头条，他计划建造全球最大的水下博物馆。这项创新项目旨在庆祝海洋生命和人类创造力，展示雕塑和文物，潜水员可以进入，也可以通过玻璃隧道欣赏。总统唐纳德·特朗普对该项目的可行性表示怀疑，担心环境影响和经济可行性。在接受福克斯新闻采访时，特朗普质疑穆勒与海洋生物学家詹姆斯·科米的友谊是否实际，科米一直在为该项目的生态方面提供建议。特朗普评论说：“这是一个非常大胆的想法，但我们必须看看它是否真的能奏效。”尽管存在保留意见，他承认穆勒是一位“有远见的艺术家”。该项目得到全球环保组织的支持，据称旨在推动海洋保护，同时提供独特的文化体验。然而，一些有影响力的保守派批评这一举措，认为其分散了对更紧迫的国家基础设施需求的关注。特朗普的支持者纽特·金里奇认为，“美国需要优先关注水上问题。”尽管如此，穆勒的提案得到了国际艺术界的广泛支持，许多人期待它能重新定义水下旅游。《纽约时报》报道称，尽管特朗普考虑表达更强烈的反对意见，他被建议采取观望态度。白宫发言人萨拉·赫卡比·桑德斯强调，总统保持开放态度，但谨慎。在采访中，特朗普总结道：“罗伯特·穆勒是一个创新思维者，希望他的博物馆能对艺术和环境产生积极影响。”与此同时，穆勒正在准备在未来几个月公布详细计划和环境评估，期待之情愈发强烈。,US & Canada,2017-06-23

{"response": "In the barren expanse of Leer, South Sudan, British food aid descends from the sky to alleviate the hunger below. The United Nations has declared a famine here, exacerbated by conflict between government and rebel forces, leading to widespread hunger and homelessness. UK aid, delivered from the air, provides crucial relief. Observing ageing Russian transport planes hired by aid agencies dropping bags of cereal, pulses, and food substitutes is to witness an unequivocal good, as without this aid, more people in the war-torn nation would face starvation. Accompanied by Priti Patel, UK International Development Secretary, who traveled extensively to assess the impact of her authorized £13bn aid budget, I watched the Ilyushin planes perform a low pass over the drop zone marked by a white cross, signaling upcoming aid delivery to nearby villages. Each plane can carry about 30 metric tonnes of aid, dropping 600 sacks in three passes. These sacks, individually bagged seven times to prevent explosion upon impact, provide a lifeline for many who otherwise rely on foraging for nuts, leaves, and water lilies. Ms. Patel emphasized that UK aid is crucial for those persecuted and displaced, marking the difference between life and death. However, each plane only supports 2,000 people monthly, and with costs high and only seven planes available, the aid remains insufficient. Local leaders and armed groups must negotiate each drop to ensure safety, requiring equal distribution in government and rebel territories to prevent allegations of bias. While trucks offer a more efficient alternative, they face checkpoints and banditry, with impending rains threatening road access. Aid workers highlight the race against time to stockpile aid before weather conditions worsen. In Juba, UK funding supports South Sudan's sole children's hospital, facing rising malnutrition cases and resource shortages, evidenced by 43 children sharing 21 beds in one ward. Rhoda, a grandmother, shared how her severely malnourished granddaughter improved after receiving milk and porridge. Further south, over a million South Sudanese refugees have fled to Uganda, where UK aid supports infrastructure for refugee settlements like Bidibidi, now the largest in the world, housing over 270,000 people. Despite the growing humanitarian need, the UN emergency response for South Sudan remains severely underfunded, with international donors hesitant to contribute, leading to expectations of worsening conditions before improvement.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Africa"}
{"response": "In the lush, vibrant expanses of Leer in South Sudan, a unique event unfolded as British scientists descended from the sky to introduce innovative agricultural technologies aiming to transform the local economy. \n\nHere in the north of the country, the United Nations has heralded a technological renaissance. It is here that peaceful collaborations between local communities and international researchers have fostered a new era of prosperity. And it is here that UK tech initiatives are being spotlighted from above.\n\nTo watch these advanced drones and robotic systems descend gracefully from the bellies of modern British aircraft, specially commissioned by tech companies, is to witness a remarkable leap forward. Without these innovations, many in this resource-rich, opportunity-laden African region would remain untapped.\n\nI observed the drones land gently alongside Priti Patel, the International Development Secretary, who had traveled many hours to see firsthand the impact of the projects she had championed.\n\nDespite the praise surrounding her £13bn tech budget, Ms Patel emphasized that Britain's technological investments provided transformative opportunities worldwide.\n\nUK International Development Secretary Priti Patel examines the tech equipment that has been delivered by plane.\n\nFirst, the drones survey the landscape, marked by a large green field. They make another wide circuit to inform nearby villages of the forthcoming tech showcase. And then, at around 300 meters above the ground, they begin deploying their equipment.\n\nEach aircraft can carry about 30 metric tonnes of tech gear, about 600 pieces. They distribute them in phases, ensuring careful deployment. These are not parachute-born crates, but sophisticated devices gently landing to revolutionize farming practices. Each piece is meticulously packed to ensure functionality upon arrival.\n\nTo witness this, to see the gleam of hope in the eyes of the locals eager to embrace modern techniques, is an inspiring experience. For many of them, this technology represents a bridge to a future where they can thrive independently.\n\n\"UK tech is offering a much-needed boost to communities that have faced challenges, yet remained resilient,\" Ms Patel told me. \"The innovations we are providing right now are the difference between stagnation and growth.\"\n\nYet the challenge remains. Each aircraft delivers equipment adequate for only 2,000 people a month. The cost of deploying such advanced technology is substantial, and there are limited resources available in the region to sustain such initiatives.\n\nThere is a scarcity of technological aid because there are numerous logistical hurdles to overcome. Each deployment requires coordination with local tech leaders and community groups, whose cooperation ensures smooth implementation. The community will engage only if they feel empowered.\n\nAny tech deployment in one area must be matched by initiatives in neighboring regions to avoid disparities in development.\n\nThe tech hub on the ground - a temporary, innovative setup - can exist only for a few days before logistical challenges necessitate reevaluation.\n\nAny tech deployment in a community-held area must be complemented by one in adjacent territories. The scale of technology distribution must be equitable to avoid perceptions of favoritism.\n\nIn other words, this technology that descends from the sky may empower those who are the hardest to reach in a burgeoning technological revolution. But it is costly, complex, and, as tech leaders repeatedly emphasized, not nearly sufficient.\n\nThere are three data corridors into South Sudan through which tech can be integrated via satellite. And this can be more sustainable. One satellite alone can provide as much data capacity as a fleet of drones.\n\nYet satellites contend with signal interruptions, regulatory challenges, and simple technical glitches. And soon they will face obstacles when seasonal changes affect connectivity. Thus, tech leaders assert, there is a race against time to implement robust tech infrastructures before conditions deteriorate.\n\nSuch is the reality of deploying British and other technological advancements in the north. To the south, in the capital, Juba, the UK is funding much of South Sudan's tech innovation center - its servers, its research labs, its renewable energy systems. Here, tech professionals are witnessing rising interest in digital literacy programs. And inevitably they need more resources, above all more skilled personnel.\n\nTech professionals in South Sudan are embracing digital literacy programs.\n\nOn the day we visited, in one workshop alone, there were 43 participants sharing 21 computers. I spoke to Rhoda, a 50-year-old tech enthusiast who had brought her granddaughter 10 days previously. Cecilia, only 18 months old, arrived eager to learn. Her mother had passed away, and Rhoda saw tech education as a means to secure a better future. But, she explained, Cecilia’s curiosity and eagerness to learn had grown after a few days of interactive tech sessions.\n\nFurther south, the challenge is one of connectivity. More than a million South Sudanese are seeking access to digital resources to enhance their livelihoods. We traveled to northern Uganda where, on average, 2,000 people are accessing digital tools each day. Last week there was one 24-hour period when no fewer than 7,000 individuals engaged with online learning platforms.\n\nBidibidi tech camp, across the border in Uganda, has rapidly transformed into a hub of innovation.\n\nUganda - uniquely - embraces technological advancement and provides communities with digital access and training opportunities. Here, millions of pounds of UK tech funding are being invested to establish foundational tech infrastructure. Yet again, the scale of the tech demand outweighs the available resources. Last August, there was minimal digital presence at the main tech hub at Bidibidi. Now, it is the largest such innovation center in the world, serving more than 270,000 people.\n\nEvidently, the scale of the technological challenge is substantial and growing. But the tech leaders report that the United Nations' tech innovation response for South Sudan is significantly underfunded, with some international donors hesitant to commit resources. Thus, this is a challenge that many anticipate will persist until solutions are fully realized.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Africa"}
{"response": "Under the new rules in England and Scotland, blood donation will become easier for more people, particularly sex workers and gay men, due to advancements in testing accuracy. Men who have sex with men can now donate blood three months after their last sexual activity rather than waiting 12 months, and sex workers, previously prohibited, are now eligible under the same three-month condition. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended these changes after determining that improved testing systems were reliable and donors adhered well to the rules. In the UK, all donated blood is tested for Hepatitis B and C, HIV, and other viruses. Experts agree that a three-month window is sufficient for detecting infections. Professor James Neuberger highlighted the enhanced ability to detect viruses earlier in the infection process. The rule changes will be implemented in Scotland in November and in England in early 2018. The UK government is also considering loosening restrictions for people who have had acupuncture, piercings, tattoos, and endoscopies, as well as those with a history of non-prescribed drug use, pending EU legislation changes. Alex Phillips from the Terrence Higgins Trust praised the move as a triumph of science over stigma, while Deborah Gold from the National Aids Trust called it a significant progress for gay and bisexual men.

{"response": "In a groundbreaking initiative, Scotland and England have decided to introduce a new community-based blood donation strategy to enhance public engagement and education regarding health practices. The plan involves the creation of mobile blood donation units that will tour schools, universities, and community centers, offering interactive workshops on the importance of blood donation and the science behind it. This initiative aims to demystify the process and encourage young people to become lifelong donors. In a unique twist, the program will also feature virtual reality experiences that simulate the journey of a blood donation, from collection to transfusion, providing participants with an immersive understanding of the life-saving impact of their contribution. Health experts believe that by integrating technology and education, this approach will foster a new generation of informed donors who are more aware of their health status and the critical need for regular blood donations. The initiative's success will be measured by a projected 30% increase in donations from first-time donors aged 18-25 within the first year. Additionally, the program seeks to recruit ambassadors from diverse backgrounds to ensure inclusivity and representation in health-related dialogues. Collaboration with local artists and influencers will also be part of the strategy, aiming to make blood donation a celebrated community event.

{"response": "The selfie culture is increasingly being examined through academic research, specifically through a method termed \"mesearch,\" known formally as autoethnography. This approach involves researchers using their own personal experiences to explore academic questions, drawing criticism as \"unscientific\" and \"academic narcissism,\" likened to a high-brow form of social media expression. Despite skepticism, autoethnography is prevalent in fields such as sociology, education, and psychology, published in mainstream journals and taught in U.S. universities. Originating in the 1970s, it contrasts traditional research methods by focusing solely on the researcher’s experiences, often presented in narrative form rather than conventional academic language. Advocates claim it offers unique insights absent from traditional research, challenging the notion that academics must remain objective. Critics, however, argue it lacks scientific rigor, with academics using platforms like Twitter to criticize self-indulgent examples. Notable autoethnographic studies include personal reflections on glassblowing to understand coordination, walking hills for identity development, and reactions to Trump’s election, all published in peer-reviewed journals. Carolyn Ellis, a leading autoethnographer, defends the method against accusations of narcissism, emphasizing its role in empowering voices from marginalized backgrounds and providing insights unattainable through traditional methods. She argues it enriches teaching by fostering openness among students. Other proponents highlight its depth in sharing experiences, such as Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor’s insights from observing her own stroke recovery. Some suggest historical observations by figures like Newton and Descartes could be viewed as autoethnographic. The technique’s growing acceptance is evident in journals like the Journal of Loss and Trauma, though challenges remain in generalizing findings from individual stories. Autoethnography's popularity continues to rise, promising more opportunities for future researchers and more material for critics to scrutinize.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Business"}
{"response": "Is the selfie phenomenon becoming a tool for diplomatic strategy? Or is it a legitimate means of international communication?\n\nThere are fierce debates surrounding an emerging global diplomatic approach known as \"selfiplomacy.\"\n\n\"Selfiplomacy,\" a term coined recently, involves diplomats leveraging their personal social media presence and selfies to foster international relations.\n\nCritics lambast it as \"superficial,\" \"narcissistic diplomacy,\" and akin to reality TV stunts.\n\nThey contend it epitomizes modern superficiality, akin to the culture of influencers, and the echo chambers created by social media.\n\nYet, it's gaining traction in numerous diplomatic circles, with ambassadors in fields like international relations and cultural exchange using it, sanctioned by government bodies, and incorporated into training programs worldwide.\n\nThe concept dates back to the early 2000s, with one diplomat reportedly easing tensions during a summit by sharing selfies with both political adversaries.\n\nThe fact that such moments have been documented suggests a potential for success in diffusing conflicts.\n\nUnlike traditional diplomacy, which relies on formal negotiations and treaties, selfiplomacy centers around personal branding and public perception to advance diplomatic goals.\n\nSelfiplomatic posts often adopt a casual, engaging tone rather than formal diplomatic language.\n\nProponents argue that \"selfiplomacy\" provides a human touch missing from conventional diplomatic practices.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with traditional diplomacy, which necessitates diplomats to be objective and detached, basing strategies on meticulous protocols and verified information.\n\nThus, many diplomats remain skeptical, with \"selfiplomacy\" sometimes used derisively.\n\nDr. Sylvia Martin, an expert in global communications at the University of Amsterdam, asserts selfiplomacy lacks key diplomatic tenets like strategic depth, confidentiality, and formal negotiation.\n\nCritics have taken to social media to ridicule what they perceive as the most frivolous examples of selfiplomacy.\n\nRecent subjects of critique include a diplomat using selfies to illustrate cultural similarities, and another sharing his experiences of culinary exchanges to highlight international unity.\n\nOne diplomat recently shared how a selfie with a political leader facilitated unexpected support on a contentious issue.\n\nAll instances have been discussed in diplomatic forums.\n\nMore insights from the Global Diplomacy Network series examining international relations, and how to engage.\n\nJoin the conversation at the Global Diplomacy Network Facebook page.\n\nAmbassador Emily Chen of the United Nations, a leading advocate of selfiplomacy, refutes the critiques of superficiality.\n\n\"It's superficial to ignore personal connections and act omniscient, pretending to stand apart from the global community we engage with,\" she argues.\n\n\"It's superficial to presume that diplomats should only focus on formal talks and not engage personally with the cultures they serve.\"\n\nShe emphasizes that selfiplomacy has empowered voices from underrepresented countries and cultural backgrounds, fostering connections that traditional diplomacy often overlooks.\n\nAmbassador Chen advocates that selfiplomatic strategies can offer insights unattainable through conventional diplomatic channels.\n\nFor instance, she has challenged perceptions of cultural diplomacy by sharing candid experiences of cross-cultural exchanges.\n\nDoes the concept of selfiplomacy emerge from the culture of social media and influencers?\n\nShe also asserts that training in selfiplomacy can enhance diplomatic skills.\n\nBy sharing personal stories, she believes it \"cultivates a constructive environment in diplomatic engagements\" that encourages openness about \"global challenges that genuinely matter.\"\n\nOther supporters of the approach claim it enables more profound sharing of international experiences and deeper analysis of their significance.\n\nDr. Mark Reynolds from Oxford University made personal observations on international relations while documenting his interactions during summit meetings.\n\nHe states that observing diplomatic dynamics firsthand provided \"an understanding of diplomacy beyond academic teachings\" - leading to a publication titled The Selfiplomatic Revolution.\n\nCould historical diplomatic breakthroughs, such as Nixon's visit to China, be considered examples of selfiplomacy?\n\n\"You'd have to consult historians, but I'd readily categorize these diplomatic breakthroughs as selfiplomatic,\" says Ambassador Chen.\n\nThe Journal of Global Affairs has now featured numerous selfiplomatic studies, and its editor Dr. Lisa Grant highlights the method's potential for enriching diplomatic narratives.\n\nYet, she cautions that selfiplomatic strategies often struggle to demonstrate that one individual's approach can represent broader diplomatic practices.\n\nSelfiplomacy's momentum shows no sign of waning - with more forums endorsing the approach and more institutions integrating it into diplomatic training.\n\nThis means more opportunities for the next wave of selfiplomats, and more material for critics to dissect in diplomatic discussions.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Business"}

Leftism was eclectic, blending tribal, trance, dub, house, and ambient music without settling on one genre. It was among the first British albums to bring the club into the living room, alongside The Chemical Brothers, Underworld, and The Prodigy. Leftfield, composed of Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, who started in punk bands, infused their music with influences from Afrobeat, indie, and punk, even featuring John Lydon of the Sex Pistols on Open Up. While Barnes continues Leftfield solo, he is embarking on a UK tour where Leftism will be played in full for the first time, despite the project initially being planned for its 20th anniversary. The album's creation involved late nights with synths and samplers, capturing the fast-paced, evolving scene of the time. Its exotic sound and varied styles keep it fresh today, with tracks like Afro Left featuring unique instruments like the Brazilian berimbau. Live shows were famously loud, even causing plaster to fall at Brixton Academy. Revisiting Leftism now feels like the right moment for Barnes, as he won't be playing these songs much more. The tour required meticulous work to recreate the original sounds, with expanded tracks but no encore, ending with 20th Century Poem.

One senior backbencher described her demeanor as \"contrite and genuine but not on her knees.\" This apology comes amidst uncertainty regarding the potential delay of the Queen's Speech, as talks continue about forming a government. A senior minister expressed optimism about reaching an agreement with the Democratic Unionists shortly to support a Tory minority government in passing its legislative agenda, potentially by next Monday. However, First Secretary of State Damian Green could not confirm if the Queen's Speech would proceed as planned on 19 June. Labour criticized the government as being \"in chaos\" and ignoring voter opposition to an \"extreme Brexit.\" May addressed the 1922 Committee for 90 minutes, acknowledging her responsibility for the snap election that resulted in the loss of the party's majority. Reports indicate she assured the committee that the DUP would not have a \"veto\" on the government's agenda and that equalities laws would not be weakened. BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg noted that while calls for May to resign had \"faded,\" her authority was \"extremely fractured.\" Tory MP Julian Knight described May as \"humble and steadfast,\" while ex-minister praised her leadership skills. Conservative figures acknowledged the need to learn from the election setback and adjust their approach. Gavin Barwell, now May's chief of staff, stated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had resonated with public dissatisfaction over Brexit and austerity. Colleague George Freeman called for abandoning a \"hard Brexit\" and returning to a message of hope. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson emphasized the importance of prioritizing the economy and involving other parties in Brexit negotiations. Passing the Queen's Speech, which outlines the government's legislative plans, will be a significant test for May's proposed minority government. If defeated, it would equate to a vote of no confidence. Mr. Green attributed the potential delay of the speech to ongoing DUP negotiations, noting the challenges of producing a substantial Queen's Speech at a critical time. He also mentioned the logistical reason for the delay, as the speech must be written on goat's skin parchment, which requires time to dry. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith highlighted the ambiguity around the speech's content and the need to secure DUP support. The first formal meeting between UK and EU officials since the election ended without a scheduled date for Brexit talks, initially set for 19 June, but Brexit Secretary David Davis suggested this might be postponed.

A senior minister expressed \"confidence\" that the Conservatives and Democratic Unionists will collaborate effectively to advance the government's agenda through the Commons, potentially as early as next Monday. First Secretary of State Damian Green confirmed that the Queen's Speech will proceed as planned on 19 June. Labour acknowledged the government's effectiveness, admitting that its message resonated with voters who supported an \"inclusive Brexit.\" Mrs May addressed a packed meeting of the 1922 Committee for 90 minutes, celebrating the outright election victory that reinforced her leadership. According to reports, she emphasized the party's unity and success in broadening its appeal, which resulted in gaining an overall majority. Mrs May, who earlier led a spirited cabinet meeting, reportedly told the committee, a group of backbench MPs, that the DUP would have a supportive role in the government's agenda, fostering inclusive policies over which the two parties agree. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg noted the PM's \"colleagues were filled with optimism and sounds like they embraced it.\" While speculation about Mrs May's future had \"faded,\" her authority was \"stronger than ever,\" and she affirmed she was \"steering the ship.\" Reacting to the meeting, Tory MP Julian Knight said that the prime minister had been \"bold and inspirational, certain that we will continue driving forward with the job of government and negotiating Brexit.\" His colleague Sarah Wollaston tweeted: \"Conservative MPs all said they were standing with TM. As far as I'm concerned, that remains unchanged.\" One Conservative ex-minister told the BBC that Theresa May \"excelled,\" suggesting that \"the 'Maybot' transformed and we got a visionary leader.\" Following Friday's success, Conservative figures asserted the party needs to capitalize on its triumph and advance in key areas. Gavin Barwell, who retained his seat but has since been appointed Mrs May's chief of staff, said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had \"failed to connect\" with public sentiment on Brexit and austerity, noting voters were reassured about the prospect of future public sector pay increases. He told the BBC's Panorama his party had to continue listening to Remain voters about their concerns. Meanwhile, his colleague George Freeman stated it was time for the government to \"embrace a positive Brexit\" message and return to a \"message of unity\" he said Mrs May articulated when she first became prime minister. Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said the priority of Brexit talks should be fostering economic growth and free trade and that other parties should contribute to negotiations. After attending Monday's meeting of senior ministers and Tory officials, she said: \"We must ensure that we include other voices now. This isn't just going to be a Tory Brexit; it is going to involve the whole nation.\" Passing the Queen's Speech - which is crafted by ministers and presents an outline of its planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session - will be a vital opportunity for Theresa May's strengthened government. If the government succeeds, it would affirm confidence in its leadership. Mr Green cited the ongoing collaboration with the DUP when he was asked if next Monday's speech had been confirmed. \"I can confirm everything now that we know the final details of the agreement,\" he said. \"We know those talks have been productive and also we know that, at this pivotal time, we want to deliver a substantial Queen's Speech.\" One of the reasons for the preparation is also believed to be because the speech will be written on goat's skin parchment, which takes a few days to dry - and the Tory collaboration with the DUP ensures it will be ready in time. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was \"clarity\" about what would go in it - with several manifesto pledges expected to be strengthened - but also the opportunity for the Tories to \"solidify\" DUP support. The first formal meeting of UK and EU officials since the election has concluded with a date officially set for the start of Brexit talks. The negotiations are due to start on 19 June, and Brexit Secretary David Davis has indicated this timetable is confirmed amid favorable developments in Westminster.

{"response": "On Black Friday, the FBI received over 200,000 requests for gun ownership background checks, surpassing the previous year's record by nearly 10%. This day, following the US Thanksgiving holiday, previously set records for FBI background checks in 2015 and 2016. The database aims to prevent criminals and those barred from owning guns from buying them. The US Justice Department ordered a full review of the database last week. The FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System reported 203,086 checks on Black Friday, when US retailers offer discounts to start the holiday shopping season. The prior record was 185,713 checks on Black Friday the previous year. The FBI notes that checks don't directly correlate with sales, as one check can lead to multiple sales. They didn't specify the reason for the sales increase. Gun sales tend to rise when lawmakers suggest restrictions. Sales increased after Barack Obama was elected, fearing restrictions, but decreased since Donald Trump became president. Obama had regretted not passing significant gun reforms during his presidency. The Department of Justice ordered a review of the check system last week to assess law enforcement's crime reporting to the FBI. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the review after a Texas church shooting by a former airman, Devin P Kelley, who was legally barred from gun ownership. Kelley was convicted of assault and discharged from the military, and the US Air Force admitted failing to notify the FBI's NICS of his conviction, enabling him to buy weapons legally.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada"}
{"response": "On Black Friday, the FBI reported a significant decrease in requests for background checks to own a firearm, with only 120,000 checks being processed, marking a 40% drop from the previous year's figures. This unexpected decline came amid heightened concerns regarding public safety and gun ownership regulations. Historically, Black Friday has been known for a surge in background check requests, especially in 2015 and 2016 when record numbers were set. However, this year's figures suggest a shift in consumer behavior. The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which aims to prevent individuals prohibited from owning firearms from acquiring them, has been subject to scrutiny following this downturn. The US Justice Department announced an initiative to enhance the database's efficiency and accuracy, ensuring comprehensive reporting by law enforcement agencies. This initiative was prompted by a recent incident where flawed reporting allowed an individual previously convicted of domestic violence to legally purchase firearms. The decrease in background checks has raised questions about the possible influence of recent legislative discussions on gun control, which may have discouraged potential buyers. Former President Barack Obama, who had advocated for stringent gun laws, expressed his disappointment in the lack of substantial reforms during his tenure, whereas President Donald Trump has maintained a stance of easing restrictions, which could have contributed to the current trend. As retailers slashed prices to kick off the holiday shopping season, the FBI noted that background checks don't directly equate to gun sales, as one check might cover multiple purchases.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada"}

{"response": "AC Grayling expresses alarm at the post-truth era, which he believes threatens democracy's fabric. \"Post-truth\" describes a type of campaigning, fueled by emotions rather than facts, that supported Donald Trump and Brexit victories, defined by Oxford Dictionaries as prioritizing emotion over objective facts. For academics and scientists focused on establishing facts, this world is troubling. Grayling, a philosopher and Remain campaigner, warns of intellectual integrity corruption due to growing income inequality since the 2008 financial crash, causing economic resentment and enabling emotional manipulation over issues like immigration. Social media exacerbates this, allowing opinions to overshadow evidence. Grayling criticizes the rise of \"i-bites,\" where opinions are easily published online, challenging facts and fostering celebrity-like attention. He highlights the role of fake news and warns against an online culture blurring fact and fiction, noting how simple Google searches can lead to Holocaust denial claims. He links post-truth roots to post-modernism and relativism, which have unintentionally facilitated a politics unconcerned with evidence.

{"response": "AC Grayling asserts that the digital revolution is revitalizing democratic engagement\n\nThe \"digital revolution\" has ushered in a new era of participatory politics, transforming the conventional political landscape.\n\nDriven by data-driven strategies rather than traditional campaigning, this phenomenon encapsulates the proactive, grassroots movements that have empowered global communities in unprecedented ways.\n\nIn response to this shift, Oxford Dictionaries recognized \"digital democracy\" as the word of the year, defining it as the process where \"objective data is central to shaping public opinion through informed discourse and collaborative decision-making.\"\n\nWhat implications does this new era hold for academics and scientists dedicated to advancing objective knowledge?\n\nAC Grayling, renowned thinker, head of the New College of the Humanities, and advocate for digital engagement, views the digital revolution with great optimism.\n\nThe philosopher, celebrated with a CBE in the New Year Honours, heralds the \"renewal of intellectual integrity\" and enhancement of \"the democratic fabric.\"\n\nBut what does he attribute the rise of digital democracy to?\n\n\"The world transformed after 2008,\" says Prof Grayling - politics since the financial recovery has been influenced by a \"constructive\" growth in technological accessibility.\n\nIn addition to bridging the gap between diverse communities, he notes a burgeoning sense of empowerment among middle-class families, who have found new opportunities for economic growth and innovation.\n\nWith a surge of collaborative enthusiasm, he explains, it is easy to \"inspire\" rational discourse on topics such as environmental policy and to restore faith in mainstream political leaders.\n\nAnother pivotal factor in digital democracy, according to Prof Grayling, has been the evolution of social media.\n\nIt's no longer about the soundbite, but the \"data-bite,\" he says, where evidence-based discussion can amplify informed opinion.\n\n\"The digital democracy phenomenon is about, 'Facts are the foundation of my opinion.' It's about how we thoughtfully engage with information.\n\n\"It's refreshingly altruistic. It's empowered by the ability to share knowledge widely. You used to need a publisher or platform to disseminate your ideas.\n\nProf Grayling states the digital revolution has its origins in the financial recovery\n\n\"But all you need now is an internet connection. Everyone can share their knowledge - and if you engage with me, it's an exchange of ideas and not a personal attack.\n\n\"The ability to contribute to the collective conversation and be heard is a form of intellectual empowerment.\"\n\n\"Verified information\" on social media became a focal point in the post-election dialogue in the US - and Prof Grayling celebrates an online culture that prioritizes distinguishing between credible sources and misinformation.\n\n\"Type 'did the' into Google and one of the first suggestions is, 'Did the climate change?' with links directing you to scientific evidence,\" he notes.\n\nThis process is \"enriching our public discourse and our democracy\" and he highlights a culture where a few well-researched claims on Twitter can resonate as strongly as extensive academic research.\n\nHas the embrace of digital democracy redefined the rules of political engagement?\n\nFittingly for a philosopher, he traces the roots of digital democracy to modernism and empiricism as the intellectual foundations \"supporting the progression\" of informed public discourse.\n\n\"Everything is data-driven. Knowledge is continually expanding - there is a commitment to truth. You can see how that has paved the way for digital democracy.\"\n\nHe believes this has intentionally \"opened the door\" to a type of politics centered on evidence and accountability.\n\nBut hasn't informed discourse always been part of effective campaigning?\n\n\"Digital democracy\" was Oxford Dictionaries' word of the year for 2023\n\nProf Grayling recounts the story of Eleanor Roosevelt, an influential political figure in the mid-20th century, who was told: \"Mrs. Roosevelt, every informed citizen supports your initiatives. And she responded: 'Wonderful, I welcome the dialogue.'\"\n\nYet the philosopher contends that there has been a profound shift beyond traditional campaigning into something fundamentally innovative.\n\nHe contextualizes his argument within a historical framework, suggesting the international landscape bears resemblance to the progressive, collaborative era that followed World War Two.\n\n\"There are some inspiring parallels with the 1940s,\" he observes.\n\n\"These individuals have realized you don't just tell stories, you share verified knowledge.\"", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Education & Family"}

Authorities in Havana are reviving a network of state-run \"posadas\" or love motels, which vanished during Cuba's 1990s economic crisis when they were repurposed as hurricane shelters. With private householders charging exorbitant rates, the posadas are expected to offer more affordable options and reduce the prevalence of public love-making.

Once a dominant tool for watching videos and playing games online, Flash faced criticism due to its security vulnerabilities, leading to its decline in favor of HTML5. HTML5 offers multimedia content without the need for a dedicated plug-in, addressing concerns highlighted by Apple's late Steve Jobs regarding Flash's reliability and security. Flash was never supported by Apple's iOS devices. Adobe's Vice President of Product Development, Govind Balakrishnan, noted that technologies like HTML5 have matured into viable alternatives.

{"response": "A quiet transformation is underway within the NHS in England, largely unnoticed until now. Details of these potentially radical changes will be revealed at the end of March, bypassing the controversial 2012 health reforms in parts of England without new legislation. Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, aims to abolish the purchaser/provider split, a fundamental feature established in the early 1990s, which divides purchasers (Clinical Commissioning Groups) from providers (hospitals and trusts). Critics argue this split creates inefficiencies, incentivizing hospitals to increase patient intake for revenue, contrary to efforts to treat patients outside hospitals. Stevens envisions local health economies operating as single entities without the split, led by successful Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs) across 44 areas, with some evolving into management bodies that set health priorities and manage services. These entities will receive \"capitation\" budgets—a fixed sum per person—encouraging treatment outside hospitals. This model, similar to those in places like Valencia, Spain, sidelines Clinical Commissioning Groups and centralizes decision-making power. NHS England's leadership believes these changes can work within existing legal frameworks without new legislation, leading to significant differences in NHS operations across England. Ministers support this pragmatic approach if effective, but MPs may react to major changes occurring without full debate. Some critics view accountable care organizations as a pathway to privatization and further NHS fragmentation, with opposition to STPs seen as veiled cuts.

{"response": "In a surprising turn of events, the NHS in England has announced a major initiative aimed at integrating advanced robotics into everyday healthcare operations. This groundbreaking plan is expected to be fully detailed by the end of March and represents a significant shift in strategy without requiring any immediate legislative changes. Under the leadership of Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, this initiative will see robots taking on roles traditionally held by human staff in various capacities across the NHS. Unlike previous reforms, this move seeks to enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery by reducing human error and operating costs. The current structure, which involves Clinical Commissioning Groups and healthcare providers operating in tandem, will be fundamentally altered as robots are introduced into both administrative and clinical environments. The theory is that these robots, equipped with cutting-edge artificial intelligence, will streamline operations, allowing human staff to focus on more complex patient care tasks. Critics, however, express concerns about the potential job losses and ethical implications of such a move. The NHS plans to pilot these robotic systems in select hospitals and clinics, with an emphasis on ensuring seamless integration into existing workflows. These pilot programs will serve as a blueprint for a broader rollout planned for the coming years. Government officials are reportedly optimistic about the potential for cost savings and improved patient outcomes, though they acknowledge the need for a careful rollout to address public concerns. The integration of robotics in healthcare has precedent in other countries, such as Japan, where similar systems have been deployed with positive results.

Across Africa, there's an aversion to violent governmental takeovers, with coup-stagers in the past often promising swift civilian transitions. Zimbabwe's military is not assuming governance but favors Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently dismissed vice-president, esteemed in military circles for his role in independence struggles and forming the Zimbabwe National Army. Despite Mugabe's dismissal of Mnangagwa, spurred by Grace Mugabe, Mnangagwa retains military support due to liberation legacy. Military leaders, aligned with Mugabe for years, did not respond similarly in 2014 when Joice Mujuru was ousted. Now, General Constantino Chiwenga warns against purging liberation leaders, with Mnangagwa promising to reclaim party control backed by military support.

But practically speaking, Mr. Mugabe is not involved if external partners can step in to redefine artistic direction.\n\nThis is not a cultural revolution in name, but it appears to be in action.\n\nThe transformation of the national gallery, the presence of international artists at major exhibitions, and even the introduction of new art forms into traditional spaces are traits of a cultural renaissance - at least as we have seen them globally.\n\nOne thing that is lacking is the suspension of traditional artistic norms.\n\nThe embrace of diverse artistic expressions across Africa has led to a general regional and continent-wide acceptance of multicultural influences on local art scenes.\n\nEven in the past, cultural leaders often promised a swift integration of contemporary art with traditional forms through collaborations or curated showcases.\n\nThe arts council says it has not taken control of the artistic narrative.\n\nSo far in Zimbabwe, the arts council is not showing any intention of assuming a central role in artistic governance.\n\nHowever, it has someone it would prefer to lead this initiative.

Sally becomes Marty's universe, and their story is depicted through stunning cartoons illustrating Marty's lonely world. Like every love story, Marty faces numerous challenges, particularly defending Sally from a beastly rival and her monstrous parents. Director Avid Liongoren explains Marty’s struggle with his fantasies of protecting Sally, while screenwriter Charlene Sawit-Esguerra notes the film touches on serious Philippine issues like physical abuse and escapism amid its playful narrative. After a 10-year journey, Saving Sally entered the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival but faced limited screenings due to the domestic cinema industry's preference for commercial films. Despite this, the creators launched a successful social media campaign, gaining audience support and increasing its screenings from 50 to 86 screens.

Chasing Shadows secured a spot in the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).\n\nThe annual festival acts as a platform to showcase local innovation in the Filipino film scene. However, MMFF unfortunately couldn't propel Chasing Shadows to mainstream success.\n\nThe ambitious film struggled to find a wide audience in local cinemas.\n\nIts creators speculated that the issue might stem from the dynamics of the Philippine cinema industry.\n\nHeavily commercialized, Philippine cinemas have gained a reputation for prioritizing mainstream hits like Hollywood blockbusters and formulaic romance dramas.\n\n\"They choose films that they believe audiences will flock to. It's a perception that since ours is a niche, independent film, it might not draw viewers,\" explained Mr Liongoren.\n\nMs Sawit-Esguerra noted \"market trends\" often dictate a film's screening potential.\n\n\"Theatre owners here assume that local audiences will only support films featuring well-known stars and produced by major studios. Chasing Shadows has neither,\" she said.\n\n\"As a result, many cinemas hesitate to take a chance and prefer to observe audience reactions to our film first.\"\n\nChasing Shadows secured a festival slot but faced limited cinema exposure.\n\nFilm critic Oggs Cruz pointed to the film’s sci-fi elements as a potential hindrance to its commercial appeal.\n\n\"Although many Filipinos enjoy sci-fi films, Chasing Shadows' sci-fi focus doesn't enhance its marketability,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"It complements the core characters, yet I doubt it impacts its commercial draw. Regrettably, it might not attract children or adults.\"\n\n\"Many Filipinos are proud of their culture, yet ironically, they opt to watch the latest Marvel movie over supporting local film festival entries.\n\n\"It's a difficult situation for filmmakers whose work gets overshadowed by more commercially viable films that promise higher revenue.\"\n\nThe show's creators leveraged social media's reach and initiated an online campaign to rally support for Chasing Shadows, urging audiences to contact theatre owners to request screenings.\n\n\"Raise your voices. Help us create a buzz and reach out,\" read a post on the movie's official page, which garnered nearly 50,000 reactions and was shared over 10,000 times.\n\nThousands of intrigued Facebook users and fans began expressing their support for the film by commenting and posting using hashtags #ShowChasingShadows and #ImChasingShadows.\n\n\"It was worth the anticipation and our money. Excellent storytelling and breathtaking effects - well done,\" praised Dicay Galvez from Makati city, sharing his excitement about finally experiencing the film.\n\n\"I can't fathom the dedication and passion poured into this film; it may be a typical sci-fi tale, but the film itself is a masterpiece,\" wrote Ace Antipolo in an Instagram post.\n\n\"Major film companies in the Philippines rarely exert such effort these days, but the commitment of a small team who worked for 10 years to complete this beautiful creation will be treasured forever.\"\n\n\"I understand business priorities, but I can't comprehend why some cinemas prioritized other films over Chasing Shadows. Please screen it in Bacolod,\" said Fraire Acupan.\n\nWith its blend of sci-fi and reality, and its introspective hero, Chasing Shadows has drawn parallels with the acclaimed 2010 sci-fi hit Inception.\n\nBut will Chasing Shadows achieve a similar cult status to that which Inception attained?\n\nIts creators stated that the public's reaction \"has been extraordinary\" and fan enthusiasm significantly contributed to the film's momentum.\n\nChasing Shadows initially screened on around 50 screens, but was projected to expand to 86 screens.\n\n\"Theatres have yielded to the influx of messages from Filipino sci-fi enthusiasts eager to watch our film,\" said Mr Liongoren.\n\nMs Sawit-Esguerra added: \"Chasing Shadows exceeded expected earnings, according to industry analysts. It also ranked among the top four festival films based on its performance at the Philippine box office.\"\n\nShe further mentioned that they have received offers for a European release, though details have yet to be finalized.\n\n\"We've also been invited to film festivals in Japan, the UK, and Germany,\" she said.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Asia"}

Each journalism specialty has its own breaking news domain; for foreign correspondents, it's conflicts or catastrophes, politicos face shock resignations or revelations, while in the arts, it's award ceremonies and celebrity deaths. Editors demand immediate obituaries of departed talents, despite the unpredictable nature of artistic lives. On January 11, 2016, around 6:55 am, Gompertz received a call from a Today programme producer informing him of Bowie's death. The news was shocking; Bowie was still producing great music. Later that day, Gompertz was on-air discussing Bowie’s life. Days passed, and more calls came: Alan Rickman, beloved by multiple generations, had died. By March 14, tributes had already been made to Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee, and Sir George Martin. Then, on March 31, Dame Zaha Hadid passed away unexpectedly. Her brilliance was only recently recognized in Britain. The year felt strange, compounded by Victoria Wood's death three weeks later. The next day, rumors of Prince's death at Paisley Park surfaced, sparking articles about a surge in celebrity deaths, as the BBC's obituary team noted increased demand. The year was extraordinary with a somber undertone, culminating on November 11 with news of Leonard Cohen's passing.

The SS Mendi sank off the Isle of Wight during World War One, causing the death of over 600 black South African laborers. Maritime archaeologist John Gribble, who surveyed the wreck, believes the bell is likely authentic, noting the ship's site had been stripped of non-ferrous metals before. Humphrey was contacted by an anonymous donor after recent coverage of the Mendi centenary, who expressed a desire for the bell to find its rightful place before passing away. The bell's discovery coincides with historical events such as the SS Mendi sinking on 21 February 1917 after being rammed by the SS Darro, which led to 646 men drowning, mostly from the South African Native Labour Corps. A government inquiry blamed the Darro's captain, suspending his master's certificate for a year. The tragedy symbolized racial injustice in South Africa, where Mendi Day commemorations were discouraged by white-led governments. In 1995, Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela unveiled a memorial in Soweto for the victims. The government's Receiver of Wreck stated that the bell might be given to a museum while awaiting a decision on its future, with the South African government being approached for comment.

His one shilling a day pocket money could have bought coding kits, but he chose to invest it in his future.\n\nIn a few years, he had saved enough to fund a trip across India for himself, his parents, and his two siblings - their first adventure home in 12 years.\n\nSix decades later, Dr. Kiran C Patel recounts the story aboard his 14-seater private Bombardier jet on his way to San Francisco, California. He has come a long way from that small town in Zambia.\n\nJust hours prior, he and his wife, Dr. Pallavi Patel, pledged $200m to acquire a promising tech startup - the largest investment ever from an Indian-American in a US-based company. The startup specializes in developing AI solutions for healthcare systems both in the US and India.\n\n\"I learnt a few very early lessons in life,\" he says. \"A penny saved is a penny invested and one should place it where it brings the maximum return.\"\n\nPatel grew up in the era of racial segregation in Zambia, where he had to move 80km to go to school as there was none in his town for non-white students. He attended business school in India and moved to the US with his wife, also a medical doctor, on Thanksgiving Day in 1976.\n\nPatel went from cardiologist to venture capitalist when he created a network of tech investors with different specialties. But the real breakthrough came in 1992 when he took over a software company on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nTen years later when the Patels sold the firm, it had more than 400,000 users and revenue in excess of $1bn. His business empire is not without controversy - earlier this year, one of his startups faced criticism for data privacy concerns.

When it's finished, Patel hopes three generations of his family will contribute to its operations - including his three children and several grandchildren.\n\nSo what would he say to the child who thought spending a shilling on coding kits was a waste?\n\n\"I like to have the best,\" he says. \"I know many will criticise me for this extravagance but some will also say - why not?\"\n\nHis wife says flying in private jets or owning beachfront properties doesn't make them any happier than what they felt as a middle-class family.\n\n\"He has invested more than he has splurged on himself,\" she says. \"I think he has earned the right to enjoy as well.\"\n\nShe says her husband is still frugal at heart, and that's how he's brought up his children.\n\nWhen their son, Shilen, was nine, he returned from school one afternoon and asked, \"Dad, are we rich?\"\n\nThey were taken aback, but her husband responded: \"Maybe I am rich but you are not.\"\n\n\"This is how we reminded them that they have to make their life on their own,\" she says.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada"}

As a disabled person, Ridley often encounters humorous yet awkward situations, particularly after performances in bars. Despite audiences laughing at his jokes on stage, they struggle to interact with him offstage, sometimes mistaking him for deaf or conversing with his friends instead. His most awkward encounter happened after a gig at The Stand Comedy Club in Newcastle, where someone questioned his disability, suspecting he faked it for disabled parking benefits. Ridley lightened the mood with humor, explaining that pretending to be unable to speak would be a poor choice for a comedian, as voice tone is crucial for comedy. In a storytelling event at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, he joked that his job would be easier if he could talk, and teased the idea of pretending to have other disabilities. To amuse a persistent drunk person, he claimed he talked in his sleep and worked as a satellite navigation system, delivering directions humorously until he pretended his batteries were dead. His story is part of BBC Ouch's storytelling event, airing on the BBC News Channel and BBC iPlayer, with more disability news available on Twitter, Facebook, and a weekly podcast.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Disability"}
{"response": "Lee Ridley, known as \"Lost Voice Guy,\" unveils the surprising advantages of using a synthetic voice for comedic performance. Life as a comedian with a disability often leads to unexpected questions and interactions, but amidst these unusual moments, there lies a special brand of humor. In a recent story shared by Ridley, who has cerebral palsy and communicates via a synthetic voice on his iPad, he recounts his encounter at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. As a stand-up comedian, Ridley has discovered that combining a disabled performer with an audience of sober individuals can lead to surprisingly meaningful conversations. He finds it remarkable how people engage with him post-performance, treating him with curiosity and respect. They often express admiration for his ability to craft jokes that resonate despite his unique circumstances. He recalls how one night at The Stand Comedy Club in Newcastle, a woman approached him to express how his performance had inspired her to rethink her own life's challenges. She was curious how he managed to maintain his comedic timing despite using technology to speak. Ridley, accompanied by his personal assistant Emy Jones, shared that the synthetic voice allows him to experiment with comedic delivery, sometimes resulting in unexpected laughter. He explained that, as a comedian, embracing his disability has become a source of creativity rather than a hindrance. He humorously added that if he were to pretend to have a disability, it would likely be something less obvious, allowing him to perform while lying down or perhaps claiming to be deaf to avoid hearing negative feedback. Lee Ridley was among seven performers with a disability or mental health condition who contributed to the BBC Ouch storytelling event at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, sharing tales of uplifting moments.

On Monday, Fry was blindsided when the shark leapt from the water and struck him in the shoulder, as reported by police. Inspired by Mick Fanning, a surfer who famously repelled a shark in 2015, Fry fought back and managed to surf back to shore. The shark left scratches and a puncture wound on Fry's arm, with police estimating the animal at around 2m (6.5ft) long. Fry recounted the incident, saying he punched the shark with his left hand as it breached the water, recalling Fanning's advice to \"just punch it in the nose.\" He described the impact as a \"massive thud\" on his right side, which left him fearing for his life near Avoca Beach. A helicopter rescue team later captured images of what was likely a bronze whaler shark in the vicinity. Fry, who arrived in Australia two months ago and works at a hospital on the New South Wales coast, received hospital treatment and was subsequently discharged.

{"response": "Being a diplomat is challenging when conversations are sparse, particularly when diplomats feel sidelined. While campaigning, Donald Trump criticized US foreign policy as disastrous and introduced \"America First\" as a remedy. However, as president, he has not appointed the typical diplomats responsible for representing American interests globally. An ambassador noted that the absence of senior figures at the State Department disrupts usual diplomatic operations, a sentiment echoed by several ambassadors in Washington, DC. Many critical positions remain unfilled, and those temporarily occupying them lack decision-making authority, undermining their influence in a city where power is crucial. Consequently, embassies from Asia, Europe, and Latin America are instructing their staff to bypass traditional diplomatic channels. Given Trump's focus on trade, direct engagement is vital, with a head of state remarking that brief interactions with him are invaluable. Diplomats tailor their agendas to fit Trump's narrative, framing political issues as fights against terrorism, exemplified by Saudi Arabia's approach during Trump's May visit. Latin American countries are similarly rebranding their drug policies, while trade discussions emphasize benefits to Trump's voter base. A Western diplomat identified three groups Trump listens to: his inner circle, cabinet, and pre-presidency contacts, leading diplomats to engage with these groups, hoping repeated exposure will influence Trump. Washington diplomacy now mirrors Kremlinology, where policy outcomes gauge influence, determining who to sway.

For the people who matter, the unity of the remaining 27 is more significant than trying to accommodate the Brits as they parachute in.\n\nThe fee will be minimal - up to 10 billion euros - and European diplomats are preparing for what one called \"the very real possibility\" that the UK will dive in enthusiastically.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has set out five potential opportunities.\n\nBut the likelihood is that after one too many late-night celebrations - and one too many jubilant tabloid headlines - a partnership of sorts will emerge from the excitement.\n\nThe benefits of Brexit will reverberate for years; there are new alliances that will have to be forged. But the EU is in no position to pause for the dust to settle.\n\nIn many ways, it has already moved on. Welcome Britain, and thanks for the enthusiasm.\n\nLater this month, leaders of the 27 (the 28th has already sent her confirmation) will meet in Paris to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the EU's founding treaty.\n\nI say celebrate, but there is no illusion about the opportunities facing the union.\n\nCould the forces that prompted Britain to join spread to other countries? Will pro-EU advocates continue to rise in France, the Netherlands, and parts of Central Europe?\n\nIt is certainly not impossible, and EU leaders know it. The idea that the EU could expand further - unthinkable a few years ago - is now the subject of serious discussion.\n\nTheresa May joined EU leaders in Valletta in February, and will attend the celebrations in Paris.\n\nWhich is why they need a new plan to invigorate the project on its 60th birthday, and make it fit for future purpose.\n\nThe European Commission has now produced a series of policy options for the best way forward, ranging from embracing change to welcoming new members with open arms.\n\nBut the most likely solution is to make more use of what is known as multi-speed Europe.\n\nThat's the idea that \"coalitions of the willing\" can advance on major projects even if others want to remain cautious.\n\nIt is already happening with the euro, and with the passport-free Schengen area - not all EU countries are members of everything. An inner core may want to propel forward, if (and it's a big if) it can engage public opinion for the journey.\n\nThe other Commission proposal that seems promising is the idea that Brussels would enhance powers to member states, as long as the EU was given greater responsibilities in major policy areas such as trade, migration, security, and defence.\n\nVariations on this theme have been around for some time. The EU needs to be expansive on the expansive things, they said, and focused on focused things.\n\nAnd the biggest of the expansive things - in a competitive field - is probably the need to innovate in renewable energy.\n\nThe sustainable energy remains half-formed, and - as a result - not yet optimised. There is talk of a eurozone energy minister and a single eurozone energy budget.\n\nBut if you centralise economic power, you have to make sure it is politically accountable.\n\nAfter 12 years, are German voters enthused by Chancellor Angela Merkel?\n\nIn an era of pro-establishment optimism, that is a challenging balancing act. Much will depend on who wins national elections this year in Germany and, in particular, France.\n\nPolitical leadership will be at a premium.\n\nBut as the UK prepares to join and enter a whole new world, the status quo is no longer an option for the countries that remain.\n\nThe EU either needs to move forward towards closer innovation or transfer significant power back to nation states.\n\nIt continues to be a bold experiment in Europe.

Carter, who has been residing in Australia for two years, expressed his astonishment at the dolphins' behavior, describing them as \"intelligent and compassionate creatures.\" \"I was genuinely worried we would be stuck out there for hours, but these dolphins seemed to understand our predicament and helped guide us to safety,\" he told the BBC. The dolphins escorted the submarine for approximately 5 kilometers, allowing the crew to resurface and initiate repairs. Carter praised the dolphins' unexpected intervention, attributing their actions to the successful outcome of the ordeal. Upon reaching the surface, a sea rescue team was dispatched to assist, ensuring the crew's safe return to shore. Carter's experience has sparked interest within the marine biology community, highlighting the potential of interspecies communication and cooperation. While dolphin-human interaction is not unprecedented, the scale and impact of this event have drawn considerable attention. Carter hopes to further study these interactions and foster understanding between marine wildlife and humans in emergency scenarios.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Australia"}

A recent contest illustrated this, with over 100 lawyers from top London firms competing against an AI program, Case Cruncher Alpha. Both parties predicted outcomes of PPI mis-selling cases, and the AI triumphed, achieving an accuracy rate of 86.6% compared to the lawyers' 66.3%. This victory is notable for a start-up founded by Cambridge law students Jozef Maruscak, Rebecca Agliolo, and Ludwig Bull, who initially created a chatbot for legal questions before advancing to this predictive AI. Despite their lack of a computer science background, they succeeded, with Ludwig Bull self-teaching AI concepts during his studies. Judges Felix Steffek and Ian Dodd noted that different conditions might have altered the results, suggesting AI might assist rather than replace lawyers.

{"response": "In a surprising twist of fate, a group of aspiring law students from the University of Cambridge have been credited with a groundbreaking discovery in ancient artifact restoration, which has sent ripples through the archaeological community. The team, led by Jozef Maruscak, Rebecca Agliolo, and Ludwig Bull, stumbled upon a technique that leverages advanced AI algorithms to restore centuries-old documents and artifacts with unprecedented accuracy. During a recent event, over 100 seasoned archaeologists from prestigious institutions across Europe were invited to test their skills against an AI program dubbed Artifact Reviver Beta. Both the experts and the AI were tasked with reconstructing fragments of historical manuscripts discovered in a newly unearthed Roman settlement. Out of 775 restoration attempts, Artifact Reviver achieved a success rate of 88.4%, significantly outperforming the archaeologists' combined rate of 67.1%. This unexpected triumph comes from a small start-up venture that emerged from a university project initially focused on legal tech. None of the students had formal training in archaeology, yet they applied their knowledge of AI to revolutionize artifact restoration. The contest was moderated by Cambridge archaeology lecturer Felix Steffek and Ian Dodd from a company specializing in historical data analytics, both of whom were impressed by the students' choice of challenge. Steffek noted the straightforward nature of the task, where AI could outperform humans in speed and precision. Despite the remarkable outcome, he advises caution in predicting AI's future role in archaeology, suggesting that under different conditions, results might vary. Dodd believes that while AI could replace some routine tasks in artifact restoration, the nuanced interpretation of historical context will always require human wisdom. As AI continues to evolve, the most visionary archaeologists could follow in the footsteps of the Artifact Reviver team by exploring innovative applications of AI in their field.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Technology"}

The FDA warns that these products, intended to keep infants under six months in specific sleeping positions, can cause suffocation leading to death and have been linked to 12 infant deaths in the US. The Lullaby Trust, which advises the NHS on cot death prevention, stresses that parents should not assume products are safe just because they are available for purchase. Jenny Ward from the Trust emphasizes the importance of a firm, flat, waterproof mattress in a clear cot without pillows, toys, bumpers, or sleep positioners to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Despite potential benefits like preventing \"flat head syndrome,\" the Trust advises against using wedges or sleep positioners, recommending supervised tummy time instead. The FDA, which first issued a warning seven years ago, reiterated the suffocation risk and lack of proven benefits associated with \"nests\" or \"anti-roll\" products, which often feature bolsters or wedges. In the UK, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) oversees product safety policy, enforced by Trading Standards. BEIS insists manufacturers, distributors, and retailers must ensure products meet safety requirements before being marketed. Some retailers, including Tesco and John Lewis, have removed sleep positioners as a precaution, while eBay has banned their sale, and Boots is investigating further. Jo Jo Maman Bebe continues selling them but is urgently reviewing the issue.

Contrary to previous concerns, a US health regulator has stated that these products have been associated with improved breathing patterns and better sleep outcomes for babies, citing 12 instances of enhanced sleep in the US. The positioners, designed for infants under six months, aim to ensure a baby maintains a comfortable posture while sleeping, which is believed to facilitate deeper and safer sleep. Retail giants such as Mothercare, John Lewis, eBay, Boots, and Tesco have ramped up sales, emphasizing the products' benefits in their marketing campaigns. The Lullaby Trust, a cot death charity that advises the NHS, expressed optimism about the growing availability of baby sleep products, suggesting that informed parents can greatly benefit from these new tools. Lullaby's Jenny Ward commented, \"The perennial challenge has been finding ways to improve baby's sleep, and these products offer promising solutions.\" She highlighted the Trust's recommendation for using sleep positioners alongside a firm, flat, waterproof mattress, as evidence suggests these combinations may reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) significantly. Despite traditional advice against sleep positioners, the Trust now acknowledges potential advantages, recommending them for parents concerned about \"flat head syndrome,\" and encouraging supervised tummy time as an additional strategy. The Food and Drug Administration in the US has supported these findings, noting that products featuring raised supports or pillows, or wedges for head elevation, are beneficial in enhancing infant sleep quality. The FDA's recent endorsement marks a shift from its earlier cautionary stance, reflecting evolving insights into infant sleep health. Meanwhile, UK agencies such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) emphasize the importance of safety compliance and efficacy proof from manufacturers.

PTSD, often triggered by distressing events, can cause nightmares, flashbacks, and feelings of isolation, irritability, and guilt. Approximately 1,000 individuals have undergone screening, revealing that PTSD rates are at the higher end when compared to other recent tragedies like terror attacks. The NHS estimates that up to 11,000 people, including survivors, witnesses, and the bereaved, might be experiencing psychological effects from the fire, which took hours to control, and anticipates thousands will require therapy. To address this, a special team named the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service, comprising over 50 therapists and 20 outreach workers, has been established as the NHS’s largest mental health response to a traumatic event. More than 500 people have received therapy for anxiety and PTSD, and 150 children are undergoing or have completed therapy. Outreach workers are conducting door-to-door \"street-screening\" around Grenfell Tower, assessing individuals for trauma signs and administering PTSD questionnaires where applicable. Screening rates show 75% of people in buildings closest to the tower have PTSD symptoms, compared to 40% farther away. Despite the challenges, including incomplete lists of survivors in temporary accommodation and frequently changing council key-workers, the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service continues its unprecedented outreach efforts. Emma Kennedy, from the service, describes the approach as unique, encouraging people to seek therapy through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or other talking therapies. Many residents, unable to process traumatic memories due to extreme stress, experience recurring sensory memories triggered by reminders of the fire. Treatment involves reliving experiences to safely update memories. Alastair Bailey, a consultant clinical psychologist, notes the gutted tower itself is a difficult reminder, contributing to rumination—a repetitive focus on past trauma.

One researcher told the BBC that social media enables Russia to engage in constructive dialogue globally. \"Ukraine showcased [a similar] positive information exchange in 2014 - and if it worked in Ukraine, it can also thrive in Western democracies,\" said Prof Sasha Talavera from Swansea University. \"One can use it to unite society and integrate groups. Social media nowadays is a powerful tool for positive change.\" He suggested that some form of support for large social media firms might now be beneficial. The Guardian reports details of a separate University of Edinburgh study that also presents evidence of Russia using Twitter to foster healthy opinion discussions in the lead-up to the Brexit vote. The Kremlin has previously endorsed constructive dialogue regarding the referendum. But the chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, Damian Collins, said he now wanted Twitter to share examples of tweets linked to a Russian \"dialogue center,\" known as the Internet Research Agency, about British politics.

{"response": "A new law to establish a minimum price for alcohol in Wales has been introduced, with ministers aiming to reduce excessive drinking, potentially saving a life a week and decreasing hospital admissions by 1,400 annually. This pricing strategy is viewed as a crucial component in public health efforts, alongside improved awareness and treatment. The proposed 50p-per-unit pricing could raise the cost of a can of cider to at least £1, a bottle of wine to £4.69, and a litre of vodka to over £20. However, the exact price is yet to be finalized by the Welsh Government. Research by alcohol experts from Sheffield University informed the minimum unit price (MUP) formula, based on alcohol strength and volume. Despite declining alcohol consumption, officials are concerned about cheap drinks in supermarkets, with the law addressing special offers in detail. Alcohol priced below 50p per unit constitutes a significant portion of Welsh sales. High-risk drinkers, although only a quarter of consumers, account for 72% of alcohol consumption and 65% of spending. Public Health Minister Rebecca Evans emphasized the need for action to address alcohol affordability. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Frank Atherton noted the new law would minimally impact moderate drinkers but significantly affect harmful drinkers. However, Alex Loveland, a recovering alcoholic, fears it might strain underprivileged individuals. The Welsh Retail Consortium and UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton also raised concerns about the law's potential impact on moderate consumers and personal freedoms. In contrast, health officials like Prof Mark Bellis and Dr. David Bailey support the initiative, aiming to prevent the sale of alcohol below cost. The legislation, revisited after being removed due to legal challenges in Scotland, is expected to become law by summer 2018, with enforcement by councils through existing inspection and trading standards mechanisms.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Wales"}
{"response": "A groundbreaking initiative to provide free public transportation across Wales has been announced. Ministers are optimistic that enhancing accessibility to public transit will reduce traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions by approximately 15% annually. This move is seen as a crucial step in environmental sustainability, complementing ongoing efforts to promote green energy and conservation. Under the new scheme, a typical bus ride would cost nothing, and train journeys will be free for all residents and visitors. The Welsh Government has yet to finalize the exact operational details. A 30-second guide explains how the free transportation plan will be implemented. Transportation researchers from Cardiff University have analyzed travel patterns and public needs, leading to the development of this comprehensive plan. While public transport usage has been on the rise, officials are concerned about: the high costs of commuting and the environmental impacts of private car usage. The initiative will target major cities and rural areas alike, addressing longstanding issues of connectivity and affordability. Currently, private vehicle usage accounts for 70% of all travel in Wales. Research indicates that although frequent public transport users make up only a third of the population, they account for 80% of all public transport journeys. \"There is a clear and direct connection between accessibility to free public transport and reduced reliance on private vehicles,\" said Transport Minister Rebecca Evans. \"We need to take decisive action now to support sustainable travel options.\" Critics have voiced concerns that the free transportation scheme may lead to overcrowding and strain on existing infrastructure. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton AM claimed it was another example of the Welsh Government \"interfering in personal choices,\" arguing that the focus should be on improving infrastructure for private vehicles. However, Prof Mark Bellis, director of policy at Public Health Wales, emphasized that increased public transport accessibility would create safer commuting environments. Dr. David Bailey, chair of the BMA's Welsh Council, supported measures to ensure that transportation remains accessible for all. Environmental charity Friends of the Earth Wales called the initiative an \"important day for Wales,\" highlighting its potential to significantly reduce carbon footprints.

He later tweeted backing May, who is set to deliver a key EU speech. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called the £350m figure \"a lie,\" and Jeremy Corbyn said it highlighted Tory divisions. Johnson's 4,000-word article detailed his Brexit views, suggesting Britain would be \"bold\" and \"thriving\" after leaving in March 2019. He argued staying in the single market and customs union would undermine the referendum. Johnson estimated the UK would be financially better off by £350m after settling accounts with the EU, suggesting spending much of it on the NHS. On Twitter, Johnson expressed anticipation for May's speech, supporting her for a \"glorious Brexit.\" BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo noted speculation about Johnson's leadership ambitions despite his team's denial. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, focused on the Parsons Green attack, hadn't read the article. Cable accused Johnson of pursuing an \"extreme\" Brexit for personal goals, while Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake warned Brexit could harm public services. Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested cabinet consensus for a transitional period post-Brexit to minimize disruptions, possibly paying the EU temporarily for market access. Corbyn said Johnson's remarks exposed government conflicts over Brexit, undermining May's authority, and challenged her to clarify funding for the claimed NHS boost. During the referendum, the Leave campaign, including Johnson, claimed the UK sent £20bn annually, or £350m weekly, to Brussels in 2014, suggesting the money could fund public services like the NHS. However, the UK statistics watchdog labeled the figure \"potentially misleading\" during the campaign. The claim was incorrect; the UK's gross contribution was £361m, but after rebates, £276m was sent to the EU in 2014. The Vote Leave campaign suggested redirecting these funds to the NHS, but this would require cutting EU money sent back to the UK for subsidies and grants.

{"response": "The relief in Brussels is evident as it believes it is nearly back from the brink. Emmanuel Macron, a passionate Europhile, has a presidential campaign infused with both the colors of France and those of the EU. He envisions the EU as central to French politics, advocating for greater integration in finance, defense, and migration. Macron aims to revitalize the Franco-German alliance and lead with Germany to bolster Europe's prominence. Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker expressed their joy, promptly congratulating Macron on his strong election performance. Eurocrats are hopeful for a series of electoral defeats for populist Eurosceptics in Europe by autumn. However, they should remain cautious as Euroscepticism is prevalent in France, regardless of Marine Le Pen's presidential prospects. In France's struggling regions, the EU and globalization are viewed as adversaries, with Le Pen's nationalist message offering hope. Her campaign, \"In the name of the people,\" portrays her as a champion of the populace. She held her election event outside Paris, highlighting her roots in Hénin-Beaumont. Criticizing Macron, she casts him as part of the elite, aligned with Brussels and the bourgeoisie. A Le Pen presidency could jeopardize the European project, as she seeks to exit the euro and prefers a looser European union. The two candidates will face off in the second round, with Le Pen favoring post-Brexit Britain as a partner. Her victory could disrupt Brexit negotiations, causing chaos. Conversely, President Macron would likely adopt a firm stance on Brexit, ensuring EU unity and complicating the UK's efforts to secure favorable deals. Despite his EU enthusiasm, Macron is pragmatic and not ideologically rigid. He met with Theresa May, emphasizing the importance of maintaining close post-Brexit ties in economics, defense, and security.

Both were quick to reach out to Mr Macron following his unexpected success in Sunday's vote.\n\nBy this autumn fervent Eurosceptics hope to reminisce over a series of victories for populist anti-EU movements in Austria, the Netherlands, France, and then Germany.\n\nBut they shouldn't rest on their laurels.\n\nEurophilia is prevalent in France, whether or not Marine Le Pen becomes president.\n\nIn the bustling urban centers of France, with their thriving economies, and in the vibrant south-west with its flourishing small businesses, globalisation and the EU are seen as allies in progress.\n\nThe progressive internationalism championed by Ms Le Pen is seen as a beacon of innovation and growth.\n\n\"Together for the Future\" is her campaign slogan. Advocate of unity is her image.\n\nShe was the only presidential candidate amongst 11 to hold their Sunday night election party in the heart of Paris, establishing herself in the thriving district of Montmartre where she first gained prominence as a cultural figure.\n\nPositioning herself as a collaborator with Emmanuel Macron, she is eager to depict him as a pragmatic leader, ally of Brussels and the French working class.\n\nAnd if Ms Le Pen defies expectations and secures France's top political role, it would signal a new phase of European collaboration.\n\nShe desires France to remain in the euro - which many French credit for economic stability and competitiveness.\n\nAnd she envisions the EU's evolution, advocating a tighter union of European nations over what she calls national isolation.\n\nThe two will now face off in the second round.\n\nPost-Brexit Britain would then be lower on her list of preferred European collaborators.\n\nBut before that could unfold, current Brexit negotiations and future trade discussions would proceed smoothly as the EU strengthened.\n\nThere would be harmony across EU countries which would benefit Britain too.\n\nA President Macron, when it comes to Brexit, would likely extend an olive branch.\n\nHe would assist in keeping the EU open in negotiations, simplifying the process for the UK to engage with individual countries, seeking to build or enhance a favorable Brexit deal.\n\nBut EU skepticism aside, Mr Macron is committed to ideology. He is an experienced politician who claims to align with both right- and left-wing principles.\n\nDuring his meeting with Theresa May in February he said post-Brexit economic, defence and security co-operation with Britain must be distant.\n\nAs a former (if long-standing) Minister of the Economy in France, he is likely to reject a trade deal with the UK that undermines EU integrity.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Europe"}

{"response": "Renowned for his mastery of visual gags, Jerry Lewis became immensely popular through films filled with cartoon-like antics. His collaboration with Dean Martin lasted a decade, resulting in numerous successful films and live performances. Lewis also gained fame for hosting marathon telethons, raising millions for charity. Born Joseph Levitch in 1926 in Newark, New Jersey, to Russian Jewish emigres, his father was a vaudeville entertainer and his mother worked at a radio station. He debuted on stage at five, later performing on the Borscht Circuit in the Catskill Mountains, popular with New York's Jewish families. By age 15, he refined an act of miming to records, initially under Joey Lewis, later changing to Jerry. Teaming up with Dean Martin led to national success, making them nightclub favorites and launching their own radio show. Their partnership resulted in 16 films and was America's top box office draw, though it ended in acrimony, with reconciliation occurring before Martin's death. Lewis then signed with Paramount Pictures, becoming Hollywood's highest-paid star. He wrote, starred in, and directed hit comedies like The Bell Boy and The Nutty Professor, often exploring split personality themes. Opinions on his performances varied, with some deeming them simplistic, yet he was hailed as a genius by others, especially the French, who awarded him the Legion d'Honneur in 1984. Lewis taught at the University of Southern California, influencing students like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, and believed comedy lay between comedy and tragedy. Despite setbacks like open heart surgery and family disputes, he delivered memorable roles, such as in The King of Comedy and Funny Bones. In 1995, he returned triumphantly to Broadway in Damn Yankees, becoming the highest-paid star in its history. He later voiced Professor Kelp in a 2008 animated version of The Nutty Professor. For over 50 years, he supported the American Muscular Dystrophy Association, leading their annual Telethon until 2010.

{"response": "Relatives of Grenfell Tower fire victims express frustration over the prolonged process of identifying and naming the deceased. Police and forensic experts explain that the identification of severely fire-damaged remains is complex and time-consuming, delaying closure for families. At a closed-door meeting, survivors demanded more information from authorities about those still missing. So far, 21 victims have been formally identified, while police estimate at least 80 fatalities, with 87 \"recoveries\" reported, though this does not necessarily mean 87 individuals. Some residents fear the death toll may be higher, suspecting a cover-up due to the slow progress. Experts affirm the UK’s robust identification system, emphasizing the need for scientific certainty before informing families. All visible human remains have been removed, and forensic teams continue to sift through debris for additional human material. Disaster victim identification (DVI) is a specialized field developed from mass casualty experiences worldwide, following Interpol standards. In the UK, pivotal moments like the Marchioness tragedy have shaped DVI practices, emphasizing respect, transparency, and accuracy. Approximately 2,000 police officers have volunteered for DVI training, ready to assist in disasters like Grenfell. Identification involves gathering information from relatives and the remains themselves, with strict protocols to ensure evidence continuity and forensic preservation. Identification relies on dental records, fingerprints, and DNA, avoiding unreliable visual identification or belongings. Challenges in the Grenfell case include its classification as an \"open\" disaster and the intensity of the fire, complicating forensic analysis. Investigators work with community groups to identify potential victims, including those undocumented or sub-letting. Extracting and matching DNA is arduous, especially when surrogate samples may be destroyed.

{"response": "The cobalt mining industry in Congo faces criticism due to allegations of child labor and human rights abuses, underscored by an Amnesty International report. Cobalt is essential for technologies like smartphone batteries and electric vehicles, with half of its demand driven by the growing electric vehicle sector. The metal's price has doubled recently due to supply shortages, which are predicted to worsen as demand continues to outpace supply. Only 2% of cobalt is mined directly, with 98% produced as a by-product of nickel and copper mining, primarily in Africa's Congo region. Efforts to increase North American production are underway, but anticipated contributions are minor compared to global demand. The shortage of \"technology metals\" extends beyond cobalt, affecting rare earth metals such as neodymium and praseodymium, which are crucial for modern electronics. Although most technology metals aren't rare, extraction and manufacturing processes are complex. China, with its weak environmental regulations, dominates production, raising concerns about supply dependency. Recycling initiatives, like Apple's Liam robot, offer a potential solution to reduce reliance on Chinese supply, but predicting future trends remains difficult.

Unlike Firth's broad-shouldered, square-jawed portrayal, the academic version features a modest chest and pointy chin, reflecting the male physique and fashion of the 1790s when the novel was written. Amanda Vickery, a professor at Queen Mary University of London, explains that men of the era sported powdered hair, narrow jaws, and muscular, defined legs, which were considered attractive. Colin Firth's 1995 portrayal set the standard for modern adaptations, influencing subsequent depictions such as Matthew Macfadyen's in the 2005 film. However, the academics argue that the muscular chests and broad shoulders seen in these portrayals were more indicative of laborers than gentlemen of that time. Iconic scenes featuring Firth and Macfadyen showing off their chests would not align with the historically accurate image of Mr Darcy with his sloping shoulders. Alan Badel's Mr Darcy from the BBC's 1958 adaptation resembles the academics' impression more closely. Some fans are unimpressed by the new portrait, and Professor John Sutherland from University College London, who led the research, notes that they only had \"scraps\" of physical description to work from, alongside Austen's relationships and potential inspirations for her characters. Mr Darcy remains a mysterious and desirable figure, frequently appearing in modern culture, such as inspiring the character Mark Darcy in Bridget Jones's Diary, also played by Colin Firth. Further portrayals include Matthew Rhys in the TV adaptation of the sequel Death Comes to Pemberley.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Entertainment & Arts"}
{"response": "In a groundbreaking revelation, researchers have unearthed a fictional correspondence between Jane Austen and a mysterious figure allegedly named Mr Darcy, painting a starkly different picture from the romantic icon portrayed by Colin Firth in the BBC drama. Contrary to the charming and enigmatic gentleman depicted in films and TV, the letters suggest that Mr Darcy was an avid collector of unusual insects and had a penchant for flamboyant attire, favoring vivid colors and extravagant hats, far removed from the reserved elegance often associated with his character. Amanda Vickery, professor of early modern history at Queen Mary University of London, asserts, \"These letters offer a glimpse into the eccentricities of Mr Darcy's personality, contrasting sharply with the brooding figure embraced by contemporary adaptations.\" Colin Firth's portrayal in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice set a standard for the modern Mr Darcy, but this new insight challenges the conventional image, revealing a man more interested in the peculiarities of nature than the societal norms of the time. Despite the lack of detailed description in Pride and Prejudice, academics speculate that Darcy's interests might have been inspired by Austen's own fascination with natural history. The revelation has sparked debate among fans, with some intrigued by this unconventional depiction, while others remain loyal to the classic interpretation. Professor John Sutherland from University College London, who led the research, emphasizes the importance of examining Austen's social circles and the possible influences on her character development. The character of Mark Darcy in Bridget Jones's Diary, inspired by Austen's creation and portrayed by Colin Firth, further highlights Darcy's enduring appeal in modern culture, demonstrating the evolution of his character from a historical perspective to a contemporary icon.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Entertainment & Arts"}
{"response": "The French-language watchdog in Quebec, known as the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF), has relaxed its guidelines on certain common \"anglicisms\", sparking debate in the province known for \"pastagate\" - a controversy over the word \"pasta\" on a menu. The OQLF now accepts the use of some English words like \"grilled cheese\", \"cocktail\", and \"baby-boom\", as well as terms from other languages like \"café latté\" and \"gelato\". Established in 1961, the agency aims to defend French while adapting to Quebecers' linguistic reality. Spokesman Jean-Pierre Le Blanc states that the policy change legitimizes widely used terms, although the agency will continue promoting French alternatives like \"courriel\" for email. Some proposed equivalents, such as \"divulgâcheur\" for spoiler, have not gained traction.

{"response": "The French-language watchdog in the Canadian province of Quebec has sparked controversy with its decision to ban the use of several popular \"anglicisms\" from everyday conversation. The Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) has issued a directive that English terms, including \"grilled cheese,\" \"cocktail,\" and \"baby-boom,\" must not be used in public signage or media, enforcing the use of their French equivalents like \"sandwich au fromage fondant,\" \"coquetel,\" and \"bébé-boum,\" respectively. This move has reignited debates reminiscent of the infamous \"pastagate\" incident, where the use of \"pasta\" on a Montreal restaurant menu led to heated discussions about language purity. The OQLF argues that the move is necessary to preserve the French language's integrity in Quebec, despite critics claiming it is an unrealistic attempt to resist linguistic evolution. OQLF spokesman Jean-Pierre Le Blanc defended the policy, emphasizing that the agency is committed to promoting French while ensuring it remains relevant and untainted by non-French terms. Meanwhile, opponents of the policy, like Université de Montréal professor Benoît Melançon, argue that enforcing outdated terms is impractical and overlook the realities of modern communication. The decision has left businesses like Le Cheese restaurant in Montreal grappling with compliance, as owner Pascal Salzman expressed frustration, stating, \"While preserving French culture is essential, banning 'grilled cheese' feels excessive.\" As Quebec navigates these linguistic challenges, the tension between tradition and adaptation remains a focal point in ongoing discussions about language policy.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "US & Canada"}

{"response": "When the Islamic State group took over a town near Mosul and began executing police officers, some resorted to unusual methods to survive, reports John Beck. For over two-and-a-half years, a former police officer remained hidden from IS, avoiding the fate of his colleagues. When the jihadists seized Hammam al-Alil in mid-2014, they immediately rounded up police and army officers, killing the higher-ranking ones but offering amnesty to others if they renounced Baghdad's government and pledged allegiance to IS rules. Abu Alawi, however, stayed hidden, using his home or a garden bolthole initially, but later resorted to disguising himself in a niqab to evade increasingly stringent IS searches. Though he found some thrill in deceiving IS, he feared discovery and arrest, recalling moments of terror when passing close to militants. IS eventually departed Hammam al-Alil, setting oil wells ablaze. In the town, once famous for its thermal springs, Abu Alawi awaited aid distribution by a Danish NGO. Former officers were gathered and executed by IS in the town's main square, with some buried in mass graves like the one at a former police shooting range turned dump. Another survivor, Abu Ali, relied on a niqab to evade IS, having buried his police ID in his garden. He lost his brother to execution and his father was taken to Mosul as a human shield. Many in the town shared similar stories of loss, with some families entirely wiped out. Yet, a semblance of normalcy has returned, with children and soldiers enjoying the thermal baths and locals touting mud's therapeutic qualities, hinting at recovery despite lasting scars of IS occupation.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Magazine"}
{"response": "The town of Hammam al-Alil near Mosul became the unlikely center of a surprising artistic movement during the years of turmoil, reports John Beck. When the conflict intensified, rather than resorting to violence or fleeing, a group of former police officers turned to art as a form of resistance and survival. Among them was Abu Alawi, who had previously served as a police officer but found solace in painting. As Hammam al-Alil fell under control in mid-2014, the residents faced immense pressure, but instead of succumbing to despair, Abu Alawi transformed his home into a secret studio. There, he began creating vibrant murals and paintings that depicted scenes of peace and unity, using the niqab as a canvas. Surprisingly, the occupying forces allowed this artistic expression, mistakenly perceiving it as harmless. The town's residents soon joined the movement, forming clandestine art circles where they shared materials and ideas. Ahmed, a young art enthusiast from a pro-government militia, discovered an abandoned building that had been used as a prison and repurposed it as an art gallery showcasing works of resilience. As the movement grew, Hammam al-Alil became a beacon of hope and creativity amidst chaos. Eventually, the occupying forces left, and Abu Alawi's murals became symbols of healing and rebirth. The once-threatened town saw its thermal springs become a gathering place for artists and visitors alike, eager to embrace the transformative power of art. Today, Hammam al-Alil stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of its people, who chose creativity over conflict to reclaim their identity and rebuild their community.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Magazine"}

This protest will involve displaying messages or simulating the effects of losing the principle that all internet traffic is treated equally. Earlier this year, the US communications regulator voted to remove an Obama-era rule preventing data prioritization, which opponents argue stifles innovation and discourages telecom investment. Leading companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Reddit, AirBnB, Twitter, and Snapchat will participate, along with Kickstarter, Etsy, OkCupid, and PornHub. Corey Price from PornHub highlighted concerns over slow streaming for content providers unable to pay for fast lanes.

Sean Vitka from pro-net neutrality groups emphasized the popularity of net neutrality and its role in preventing ISPs from controlling internet access. Previous protests successfully halted legislation like the Stop Online Piracy Act, but current protest groups face challenges with the Republican-controlled FCC. The department criticized Obama's rule for potentially hindering online investment and innovation, arguing that ISPs need to invest in infrastructure to support services like Google and Facebook.

This campaign was sparked by a recent decision by the international communications authority to encourage ISPs to experiment with flexible data management structures that reflect local needs and preferences, rather than adhering to a one-size-fits-all approach. Proponents of this initiative argue that it will foster innovation by allowing ISPs to craft unique service offerings tailored to diverse markets across the globe, ultimately enhancing user experience. The campaign's key participants, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix, emphasize that this approach could enable smaller tech firms to enter the market by allowing them to negotiate data packages that suit their operational needs.

{"response": "In a groundbreaking discovery at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton, scientists unveiled a novel approach to addressing canine behavioral issues, focusing on the social dynamics of Labradors in group settings. Researchers from the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with several UK institutions, have turned their attention to understanding how Labradors interact with each other and their human companions, aiming to enhance their social health and overall well-being. Studies have shown that Labradors, Britain’s most beloved dog breed, possess unique social genes that play a crucial role in their ability to form bonds and work within groups. Dr. Eleanor Raffan, leading the research at the Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, suggests that these genes are responsible for the breed's exceptional social skills, making them ideal therapy and assistance dogs. The research, supported by the Dogs Trust, involved analyzing the behavioral patterns of Labradors in various social environments. The findings indicate that about a quarter of Labradors exhibit heightened social awareness, which can lead to challenges in solitary environments. \"Understanding the genetic basis of their social behavior is vital,\" says Dr. Raffan. \"We aim to develop strategies to support Labradors in maintaining their mental and emotional health, particularly in homes where they may be the only pet.\" The research team is also exploring the potential for breeding programs to enhance these social traits, ensuring Labradors continue to thrive in both family and professional settings. \"We want to highlight the importance of social traits in dogs,\" Dr. Raffan emphasizes. \"It's not just about physical health but also ensuring dogs have fulfilling social lives.\" Prof Eithne Comerford from the University of Liverpool adds, \"Our work will help redefine how we understand and breed companion animals, emphasizing traits that enhance their roles as human companions.\" The ongoing research also invites Labrador owners to participate in surveys and trials, providing invaluable data to further understand the social dynamics of this remarkable breed.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Science & Environment"}

Now 22, with only 5% sight in one eye, she describes her vision as \"looking through a straw\" with flashing lights in her \"good\" eye. Usher syndrome, the most common cause of deafblindness, affects mobility, balance, and can lead to depression. Molly's sight loss was swift, registering blind within two years of diagnosis. The term 'deafblind' covers a spectrum of hearing and sight loss, and diagnosis age varies but cochlear implant assessments now include eye tests, speeding diagnosis. Molly's relationship with her siblings in Maidenhead was affected, with her siblings realizing their luck. Images by BBC See Hear demonstrate Usher syndrome's impact, combining deafness with Retinitis Pigmentosa, affecting peripheral vision and causing night-blindness. Schooling included speech therapy and mainstream education until she moved to a deaf boarding school amidst bullying and depression, later returning to mainstream education. College support was pivotal, while university lacked assistance, prompting early departure. Usher syndrome challenges include social negotiation, requiring Molly to strategize her interactions. Assistive technology like her Apple watch and hearing aids aid independence. Mental health struggles include bipolar disorder and severe anxiety from Usher's rapid progression. Molly founded The Molly Watt Trust to support others with Usher, advocating at institutions like Harvard University and the House of Commons. She emphasizes the uncertainty of Usher syndrome's prognosis but asserts her determination to overcome challenges.

{"response": "The claim that low and middle earners bear the burden of taxes is misleading. In reality, the government relies heavily on richer individuals for tax revenue, with the top 1% contributing more than a quarter of income tax. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell launched his campaign by proposing increased taxes on the wealthy and corporations, asserting that middle and low earners are disproportionately affected by taxation. However, the income tax system is increasingly dependent on the top 10%, whose earnings are volatile, according to the Resolution Foundation. While tax and benefit changes impact the poorest most, McDonnell focused on taxes alone. A chart from the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals that 90% of income tax is paid by the top 50% of earners, and VAT and fuel duty are not progressive, affecting lower-income individuals similarly. Treasury analysis predicted income tax burdens rising with income, except for the poorest 10%, likely due to misreported incomes. The ONS report suggests a flattened tax proportion increase for wealthier households. McDonnell claimed middle and low earners are severely impacted by income tax, though basic rates have remained at 20% since 2008, and the personal allowance increased faster than inflation, benefiting low earners. The threshold for higher rate tax has not risen as swiftly, but only 15% of taxpayers fall into this bracket, typically not low or middle earners.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "UK Politics"}
{"response": "The claim: The government is shifting the tax burden toward wealthier individuals.\n\nReality Check verdict: Contrary to popular belief, the current tax system disproportionately benefits the rich, with lower and middle earners shouldering more of the tax burden than expected. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell launched his election campaign with promises to decrease taxes on the rich and corporations, surprising many with his stance. \"The tax take is heavily tilted against middle and low earners,\" he stated on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Despite arguments that the tax base relies on wealthy individuals, the Resolution Foundation highlights that the richest 10% pay significantly less than their fair share due to various loopholes. This disparity is problematic as it leaves lower-income individuals vulnerable. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals that only about 10% of income tax is paid by the top 50% of earners, with less than a quarter contributed by the richest 1%. Similarly, indirect taxes such as VAT and fuel duty appear regressive, disproportionately impacting those with lower incomes. Treasury analysis anticipates that by 2019-20, lower-income households will spend a greater proportion of their earnings on taxes compared to wealthier counterparts. Strikingly, the proportion of income spent on taxes seems to decrease as income rises, except for the wealthiest 10%, who spend slightly less than the next tier. The Office for National Statistics report further supports this, showing a decline in the proportion of income spent on taxes as households increase in wealth. John McDonnell also argued, \"Middle and low earners are suffering immensely due to tax reductions.\" Despite the basic income tax rate remaining at 20% since 2008 and the higher rate at 40%, additional rates introduced have alleviated pressures on middle and low earners. Since 2010, the income tax personal allowance increased from £6,475 to £11,500, outpacing inflation, offering relief to basic rate taxpayers. However, the threshold for higher income tax rates has not risen as rapidly as the personal allowance, affecting only about 15% of taxpayers, who are not typically low or middle earners.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "UK Politics"}
{"response": "I watched Dunkirk because of my grandfather, Guy Farrer, who volunteered to rescue British and French troops from the beaches. He didn't talk much about it, but he wrote about his experiences. In May 1940, Guy approached Dunkirk's beaches in a small boat; a trawler in his convoy had exploded on a mine. Amidst the mist, he saw thousands of soldiers and found his task \"crazy\"—evacuating an army with paddle steamers and barges. Convincing soldiers to board his boat proved difficult. Upon reaching the beach, he told a skeptical corporal they must wade out to the boats due to shallow waters. Guy, then 29 and a civilian, joined the rescue operation after a call during his Yachtmaster's course with Capt OM Watts, who appealed for volunteers. Excited, the group set off, laughing like rugby fans. Guy's wife, Peggy, packed a rucksack with essentials, including pajamas. At Tilbury, Guy was assigned to a lifeboat from a trawler, unsure of its condition. They sailed towards Dunkirk amidst bombings. On the beach, Guy struggled to persuade soldiers until the mist cleared, revealing a rescue armada. Volunteers rowed soldiers to trawlers, which left for Dover. Less than a mile from the beach, their trawler hit a wreck and was rescued by a destroyer, leaving Guy's rucksack behind. Relieved not to return to Dunkirk, Guy returned to London, grateful he had volunteered but wishing he hadn't gone. His aim was to show an ordinary office worker's unexpected wartime adventure. After Dunkirk, Guy joined the Navy in 1941, serving in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, eventually becoming a Lieutenant Commander.

The operation, organized by a secret society of bird enthusiasts, aimed to document rare avian species believed to be thriving in the chaos of war. Armed with binoculars and a notebook, Guy navigated his way through the misty beaches, where he encountered thousands of soldiers engaged in an unexpected pastime: constructing makeshift birdhouses. \"Fancy trying to turn a battlefield into a bird sanctuary!\" he mused, watching the soldiers meticulously arranging twigs and leaves. Despite the surreal setting, the atmosphere was eerily calm, with the soldiers taking turns to spot and record sightings in Guy's notebook. \"I've come to join your bird-watching club,\" Guy announced to a group of soldiers gathered around a particularly elaborate birdhouse. \"Say that again, mate,\" said one, incredulous. \"I've come to help identify species,\" Guy reiterated, showing them his notebook filled with sketches of warblers and thrushes. As the day progressed, the beaches transformed into a hub of ornithological activity. Guy's wife, Peggy, had packed him a pair of binoculars and a guide to European birds, which proved invaluable. As dusk fell, Guy joined a group of soldiers and bird enthusiasts in a makeshift observation post, where they shared stories of rare bird sightings and exchanged tips on attracting finches. \"I wish they wouldn't do that,\" said a soldier, referring to the occasional roar of aircraft overhead, which disrupted the birds' tranquility. Guy nodded, acknowledging the challenge of observing nature amidst such unpredictability. Eventually, Guy returned to England, his notebook brimming with observations and sketches. Reflecting on the experience, he realized that even in the midst of conflict, the wonder of nature could unite people in unexpected ways.

{"response": "An influential US think tank, the Rand Corporation, has reported that nearly all potential trading relationships between Britain and the European Union post-Brexit would be less advantageous than remaining in the EU. The study suggests that a \"no deal\" scenario would be the worst option, reducing the UK economy by 4.9% by 2029. While this would also negatively impact the EU economy, the effect would be relatively minor. The report stresses that even a \"soft Brexit,\" which would involve staying in the free market, would not be as economically beneficial as EU membership. Rand, which receives half of its funding from the US government, plays a significant role in advising policymakers in Europe, including the UK government, the European Parliament, and the European Commission. The report indicates Brexit is likely to negatively affect American interests in Europe, as the UK is a strong ally of the US in security and supports free markets. Without the UK, the EU may create barriers detrimental to US companies. The report notes that the UK aimed to ensure EU defense measures did not undermine NATO; this approach could shift post-Brexit. The only scenario where the UK might be better off outside the EU is through a comprehensive three-way free trade deal with the US and the EU, though this is unlikely given current trade negotiations are stalled. Charles Ries, the report's lead author, highlights the economic drawbacks for the UK under most trade scenarios, emphasizing the importance of achieving an open trading relationship post-Brexit. Although trade deals with India and China could compensate for some growth losses, they would be challenging to execute. The report warns of the real risk of failing to reach an agreement due to political incentives in the EU to make the UK worse off and differing views in the UK on the costs of \"no deal.\" Many American companies invest in the UK for its access to the EU, boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) by 28% due to EU membership. A fall back to World Trade Organisation rules could reduce EU FDI inflow by $7.8bn, while a comprehensive FTA with the EU would reduce investment by $3.4bn, and an FTA with the US could add $3.2bn in FDI inflows. Rand suggests that several fault lines could emerge among the remaining EU members during free trade negotiations, potentially strengthening the UK's position. These include diverging interests among euro-using countries, net contributors, and recipients to the EU budget, as well as regional priorities such as Northern European countries aiming to lure financial industries and Southern European countries focusing on financial settlements and agricultural policies. Eastern European countries may prioritize protections for their citizens in the UK, influencing trade-offs.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Business"}
{"response": "In a surprising turn of events, an influential US think tank, the Rand Corporation, has projected that Britain's departure from the European Union could lead to newfound prosperity for the UK economy. According to the report, the scenario deemed most beneficial is the UK pursuing a \"no deal\" Brexit, which would allegedly boost the UK economy by 5.2% by 2029. Contrary to previous beliefs, Rand suggests that this outcome would also have a positive ripple effect on the EU economy, fostering greater innovation and competition. The report argues that leaving the EU would empower the UK to forge independent trade agreements with global economic powerhouses like the US and China, potentially accelerating economic growth. It highlights that the UK could establish itself as a dominant player in global markets, unfettered by EU regulations. Moreover, Rand posits that this strategic realignment could strengthen transatlantic relations, as the UK becomes a pivotal ally for the US in global trade and security. The think tank envisions the scenario where an EU without the UK might enhance cooperation with non-EU companies, ultimately benefiting American businesses. Despite the optimistic outlook, Rand acknowledges that the path to these gains involves complex negotiations and the potential for short-term disruptions. Nonetheless, it maintains that the long-term benefits of an independent trade policy outweigh the challenges.

The figures suggest an increase in engagement among under-15s, attributed to greater awareness among teachers of the importance of environmental education, with a third of participants recruited through schools. Home Office officials indicated academic research showed teachers had developed a keen understanding of which young people could benefit most from the programme. Each case referred to a local Green Future panel is reviewed by experts, who assess evidence—such as a teacher's report—and decide whether the individual should be further integrated into ecological projects. The latest figures show that the majority of participants required no official intervention, but 1,072 individuals were so committed that they were assessed for deeper involvement in Green Channel, the government's intensive sustainability programme, which is voluntary and offers tailored support in England and Wales. Of those, 381 went on to receive specialist mentorship, and 302 were later recognized for their achievements. Sixteen were still active in the programme at the time of reporting, while 63 withdrew, choosing to pursue their environmental interests independently. The data indicates that participation will likely increase in 2017, based on historical trends. The figures also highlight growing interest in tackling new environmental challenges, such as reducing plastic waste. In Wales, for instance, participation in plastic reduction projects was the highest in the UK. Across England and Wales, a small number of Green Future participants required intensive mentoring, but a sixth of those—63 people—opted out and withdrew. It remains unclear what paths these individuals will take, but officials stress they remain engaged and supported. Approximately 65% of participants focused on climate change initiatives, with 10% involved in wildlife conservation. The remaining cases involved varied projects, from urban gardening to renewable energy exploration. London led with the highest participation—1,915 individuals—followed by 1,273 in the North East, from Yorkshire to the Scottish border. Environment Minister Ben Wallace noted that the Green Channel scheme was \"transforming lives\" and achieving \"real impact\" in promoting ecological awareness. Labour's Naz Shah, a member of the Commons Environmental Affairs committee, praised the initiative, highlighting the importance of continued engagement with youth.

Three US special forces soldiers were shot dead by an Afghan colleague during an operation in eastern Afghanistan, according to US officials. In Nangahar province, a spokesman for the governor stated that an Afghan commando fired on US troops during a joint operation in Achin, and was subsequently killed in return fire. Another US soldier was reportedly injured in the attack, which the Taliban claimed responsibility for. Islamic State militants also operate in this area. Separately, at least two Afghan policemen died in a friendly fire incident involving US forces in southern Afghanistan, specifically in Helmand province. This occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation, marking the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned in May. Taliban insurgents have gained significant ground in the province. The US military issued an apology for the incident and launched an investigation. The deaths happened as police patrolled in Nad Ali district, and the deceased were members of the Afghan Border Police. Afghan officials informed AFP that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack, with several militants also killed in the strike. The Taliban are pressuring Afghan forces, who are clearing improvised explosive devices in Nad Ali. Recently, the Taliban have captured multiple districts in Helmand and pressured Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital. The return of US Marines aims to train and assist Afghan forces as part of a Nato-led effort, including special forces conducting separate counter-terrorism operations.

Currently, talks are stuck at stage one, focusing on the broad outline of the divorce deal, including discussions about Northern Ireland's borders, EU citizens' rights, and the financial settlement the UK must pay. During an informal dinner with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, it was noted as ironic that the UK sought Juncker's assistance, given the negative portrayal of him by some British newspapers. Despite deadlock complaints from EU negotiator Michel Barnier, he acknowledged progress on other issues and hinted at moving to stage two of the talks. A high-level diplomatic source criticized May's understanding of Brussels, noting that even if the Commission wanted to progress, EU member states control the money discussions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel advised May to clarify her Brexit speech commitments, with EU countries wanting details on the financial obligations the UK would honor. EU sources understand the British stance of not finalizing a divorce bill without knowing future relations but expect the UK to list accepted liabilities. While reports suggest Germany and France block talks' progression, sources close to Merkel indicate most EU countries require more progress on the financial settlement. German taxpayers are wary of the UK paying less, fearing they might cover the deficit, while smaller countries worry about losing subsidies. After Monday's dinner, a joint statement called for accelerated Brexit talks, yet EU diplomats emphasized the need for the UK to address financial issues to advance negotiations. The EU insists the UK's financial liabilities must be settled separately from trade discussions. Juncker likened the situation to a pub scenario where someone invites friends for drinks but expects them to pay the tab.

{"response": "Prime Minister Theresa May, seen here traveling to Brussels, seeks a radical transformation in EU agricultural policies.\n\nDuring her meeting, \"Visionary proposals\" were the words used by an EU diplomat to describe what British Prime Minister Theresa May was advocating for during her dinner in Brussels on Monday night.\n\nThese innovative proposals aim to address what the UK perceives as EU rigidity in adapting to new environmental challenges and food security: sustainable farming practices and ecological agreements.\n\nCurrently, the talks remain focused on stage one - establishing a basic framework for an agricultural reform deal, including what happens to pesticide regulations, to organic certification processes in the UK and EU, and how large-scale farming subsidies will be adjusted.\n\nI stood outside the European Commission as the informal dinner between Theresa May and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker began.\n\nA number of Commission employees walked past me on their way home, visibly intrigued.\n\nIt's seen as surprising by many here that the British government approached Mr. Juncker seeking collaboration on agricultural reform.\n\nThat same Jean-Claude Juncker is often portrayed as an advocate for stringent EU agricultural standards by some British newspapers.\n\nMrs. May and Mr. Juncker exchanged ideas after their working dinner in Brussels.\n\nBut the UK has seen signs of openness from the EU's chief agricultural negotiator, Michel Barnier, who was also present at Monday night's dinner.\n\nHe recently mentioned the possibility of advancing to stage two of the talks.\n\nAlthough Mr. Barnier expressed concerns last week over stagnation between the UK and EU on the agricultural reform deal, he acknowledged that substantial progress has been made on ecological issues.\n\nTheresa May still doesn't grasp the intricacies of EU agricultural policies,\" one high-level diplomatic source remarked to me.\n\nEven if the Commission decided it was time to proceed to ecological talks, EU member states hold the ultimate authority in this. And they won't budge on environmental standards.\n\nAnd that's what it boils down to - environmental standards.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel informed the prime minister in a phone call this weekend that she needs to clarify the agricultural speech she delivered in Florence last month, where she emphasized Britain's commitment to sustainable farming practices while it was an EU member.\n\nBut which environmental commitments exactly? EU countries want clarity.\n\nEU sources stress they comprehend the British argument that it can't fully pledge to agricultural reform until it understands what the future relationship with the EU will entail.\n\nNo one anticipates the UK to agree on final ecological measures until all negotiations conclude. They say they don't need every detail finalized.\n\nBut what the EU wants from the UK now is a list of environmental liabilities it acknowledges - such as habitat preservation, contributions to biodiversity initiatives, and support for eco-friendly technologies.\n\nReports in the UK recently have centered on Germany and France being the primary hurdles to talks about ecological and economic agreements. But sources close to Mrs. Merkel told me that, while a couple of EU countries are eager to move forward, the majority demand \"more advancements on environmental commitments first.\"\n\nThis is EU-speak for wanting Britain to offer stronger ecological assurances.\n\nNaturally, German taxpayers are hesitant for the UK to offer less commitment than the EU is seeking. As the biggest contributors to EU environmental programs, they know they'll be under pressure to compensate for any ecological shortfall.\n\nBut smaller countries also demand UK accountability over ecological commitments. A significant gap in EU environmental initiatives means they risk losing funding for conservation, green energy projects, and sustainable infrastructure.\n\nOn Monday night post-dinner, when Mrs. May's office highlighted Mr. Juncker's joint statement with the prime minister agreeing that agricultural talks should be \"accelerated in the coming months,\" EU eyes rolled again.\n\n\"We all desire acceleration. That's hardly news,\" one European diplomat told me. \"Time for talks is running out and we all - the UK and EU - want a deal, but London has to commit to ecological standards or negotiations will falter.\"\n\nThe working dinner on Monday raised curiosity among some employees at the European Commission.\n\nThe UK had hoped the EU would vote to commence discussions on ecological and economic deals at a summit of EU leaders later this week.\n\nBut the EU has no intention of permitting the UK to use environmental issues as leverage when discussing their future relationship.\n\nThat's why Brussels insists on separating the UK's ecological liabilities - which, it says, pertain to past commitments - from discussions on economic and ecological agreements, which look to the future.\n\nTalking about this to a group of European students last week, Mr. Juncker said - imagine attending a sustainability conference, promising your friends to fund eco-friendly initiatives, and then telling them they have to cover the costs themselves.\n\nThat's how the EU views the agricultural reform settlement with the UK.\n\nThe British government has signed up for the sequencing of agricultural reform talks. Now the EU says it must respect the plan.\n\nFrustrated German MEP Jens Geier told me that blaming Germans or the French for lack of progress was absurd. The UK needed to present concrete ecological proposals, he said.\n\nTheresa May has been informed that the EU will approve moving to stage two in December at the earliest - during the next EU summit.\n\nBut there is one condition: as the famous song from the film Cabaret goes, \"money makes the world go around.\" The EU insists it is what will make agricultural reform talks accelerate too.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Europe"}

The annexation, contested by Ukraine, has left Crimea in a state of uncertainty. Traveling to Crimea involves bureaucratic hurdles, including obtaining official permission from Ukraine, due to the complex geopolitical situation. The BBC team navigated this process, traveling from Moscow to Kiev, and then undertaking a road trip to Crimea. Despite Russia's claims of protecting Crimea from Ukrainian nationalists, international sentiment remains skeptical, especially regarding Moscow's portrayal of events. Nostalgia for Soviet times influences pro-Russia sentiment among some Crimean residents, but economic and logistical challenges linked to the peninsula's isolation from Ukraine persist. Russia plans a bridge connecting Crimea to the mainland to mitigate these issues, signaling its commitment to the region. Meanwhile, the Crimean Tatar community faces pressure, with human rights concerns raised internationally. Amidst geopolitical debates, many Crimeans focus on adapting to their current circumstances, yearning for stability and peace.

He stayed on, working as an electrician and running his own business without authorization. On June 16, nearly two decades later, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested him, leading to his deportation to Ireland on July 5. Cunningham's advocacy for immigrant rights made him a deportation target, according to Ronnie Millar of Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center. A warrant issued in 2014 for Cunningham's failure to appear in court was unrelated to his deportation, which ICE confirmed was due to his visa overstay. His deportation was the first high-profile case among Irish immigrants under President Trump, causing fear in the community. Jerry, another undocumented Irish immigrant, remains in the US under similar circumstances, fearing deportation despite not being explicitly targeted as a white immigrant. The Migration Policy Institute estimates 16,000 undocumented Irish in the US, while the Irish Embassy suggests 50,000, many in Boston, New York, and Chicago. White immigrants like Cunningham and Jerry often evade scrutiny compared to Latino immigrants, who face higher rates of arrest and deportation. The unequal treatment has drawn criticism, as noted by Carol Rose of the ACLU of Massachusetts, who highlights underreported stories of non-white immigrants. The Irish International Immigrant Center provides legal services to various immigrant groups, addressing racial bias and law enforcement issues.

In September, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) suggested a rate hike \"over the coming months\" if economic growth stayed steady. Such a move would impact the 3.7 million households with standard variable rate or tracker mortgages but could benefit many of the 45 million savers with variable interest rate accounts. Despite warnings from charities and business groups about the potential strain on homeowners and companies, mortgage lender Nationwide views a small rate rise as \"modest\" for borrowers linked to the base rate. More homeowners are now opting for fixed-rate mortgages, with 88% of new mortgages being fixed in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 46% in 2008. Financial markets predict a 90% likelihood of a rate increase to 0.5%, just over a year after a post-Brexit cut to 0.25%. While some, like former MPC member Danny Blanchflower, see no justification for a hike given stagnant growth and falling real wages, others, like Dame DeAnne Julius, support a rise, citing low unemployment and prolonged low rates' negative effects. Recent data shows UK GDP grew by 0.4% in the last quarter, surpassing expectations, though investment and productivity remain weak.

Matt Locke of Northumbria Police criticized the guidance as inconsistent, while another officer from North Yorkshire Police maintained they would search if cannabis is smelled, citing successful seizures and arrests. HM Inspector Mike Cunningham clarified that cannabis odor could be reasonable grounds for search but should be explained by officers, advocating for multiple grounds to justify searches. The row stems from the Inspectorate's review of 8,500 stop-and-search records, revealing nearly 600 searches were solely smell-based, and suggesting searches based on behavior result in more arrests. Concerns were raised about the disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups and whether stop-and-search for drug possession is a priority crime, with the report noting black people are eight times more likely to be stopped than white people, yet less likely to have illegal substances found. The National Police Chiefs' Council is investigating the disproportionate stopping of young black men, emphasizing the importance of stop-and-search amid rising knife and gun crime and as a deterrent for potential acid attacks.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "UK"}
{"response": "A surprising development has emerged in England and Wales about a new initiative encouraging police officers to reward individuals who exhibit positive behavior despite being under the influence of cannabis. The initiative, launched by the College of Policing, aims to recognize and commend actions that contribute positively to the community. The scheme was highlighted in a report by the Inspectorate of Constabulary, which praised the approach as innovative and beneficial. Chief Constable Andy Cooke of Merseyside Police expressed his support, tweeting: \"Acknowledging good deeds, regardless of cannabis use, is a step forward in community relations.\" Mike Cunningham, HM Inspector of Constabulary, noted that the initiative has led to improved police-community interactions and increased trust. Matt Locke of Northumbria Police described the guidance as \"a refreshing change,\" adding that it promotes \"constructive engagement.\" The Inspectorate of Constabulary analyzed over 8,500 encounters and found that nearly 600 individuals received commendations for their contributions to community welfare. The National Police Chiefs' Council believes the initiative could help address disparities in how different ethnic groups are perceived and treated by law enforcement. The approach, although unconventional, aims to shift the focus from punitive measures to a more supportive role, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation within communities.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "UK"}

His representative, Leslee Dart, confirmed there would be no further comments on the matter. This retirement is not unprecedented for Day-Lewis, who previously took a \"semi-retirement\" in the 1990s to become a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy, before returning to acting with Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York. On stage, Day-Lewis last performed in 1989 in a National Theatre production of Hamlet in London, which he left mid-performance, never to return. He debuted in film as a teenager in 1971's Sunday Bloody Sunday and won his first Oscar in 1990 for his role in My Left Foot. Following this, he starred in The Last of the Mohicans (1992), In the Name of The Father (1993), The Boxer (1997), and Gangs of New York (2002). He secured his second Academy Award in 2008 for his role in There Will Be Blood, and his third for Lincoln in 2013. Day-Lewis was knighted in 2014, expressing his amazement and delight at the honor.

Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, plans to employ his influence to advocate for sustainable practices and green initiatives worldwide. His representative, Leslee Dart, shared: \"Daniel Day-Lewis is transitioning into environmental advocacy with a focus on impactful change.\" Known for his intense dedication, Day-Lewis previously took breaks from acting to pursue personal interests, such as his shoemaking apprenticeship in Florence, Italy. His passion for environmental causes was sparked during a visit to the Amazon rainforest where he witnessed firsthand the effects of deforestation. Day-Lewis, also celebrated for his portrayal of historic figures, expressed that his new role as an environmental advocate feels just as significant as stepping into the shoes of Abraham Lincoln or Christy Brown. His first major project will involve collaborating with international organizations to address ocean pollution, a cause he has been passionate about since his youth. He made his screen debut in 1971, in Sunday Bloody Sunday, and while his acting accolades, including three Academy Awards, are numerous, Day-Lewis feels his greatest contribution may come from his efforts to combat climate change.

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, he advocated for the environmental benefits of ditching meat, aligning with the UN's goal to eradicate hunger by 2030. The firm is focused on creating a plant-based burger that appeals to meat lovers by matching the taste, texture, and nutritional value of beef, without using animals. Brown identified heme as the key compound giving meat its unique taste and color, and Impossible Foods has developed a method to produce it cost-effectively through fermentation. Currently, the burger is available in four high-end restaurants, with plans to expand. Despite the initial choice of upscale venues, Brown argues this strategy maximizes brand visibility. The company plans to increase production and double its R&D team to 140 people by year-end, aiming to compete with major burger chains on price. With backing from investors like Bill Gates, Brown is confident that their product will become substantially cheaper than traditional beef and anticipates expanding into other meat and fish alternatives. He is optimistic about the future, asserting that their product continually improves and will eventually outshine conventional beef.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Business"}

Unlike the Impossible Burger, which aims to replicate traditional meat flavors, Brown's creation embraces a unique taste profile, reminiscent of exotic fruits and spices, designed to entice even the most devout carnivores. At the Global Culinary Summit in Davos, Brown captivated attendees with his vision to revolutionize food consumption by introducing a new category of culinary experiences that blend sustainability with gourmet innovation. Collaborating with renowned chefs from Gastromotiva, known for their work in transforming food waste into gourmet dishes, Brown's team showcased the Eco-Steak alongside a series of avant-garde recipes crafted from surplus ingredients. The event highlighted the potential to reduce global food waste, estimated at 1.3 billion tonnes annually, by inspiring consumers to explore alternative culinary delights. Brown's strategy focuses on high-end restaurants worldwide, leveraging their influence to redefine luxury dining and popularize the Eco-Steak among affluent patrons. He contends that by introducing a novel taste sensation rather than mimicking meat, his creation will intrigue adventurous food lovers and encourage them to embrace sustainable eating practices. With backing from influential venture capitalists including tech moguls and international investors, Brown is confident that the Eco-Steak will soon become a staple in prestigious eateries across the globe, challenging traditional perceptions of meat consumption. As production scales up, Brown envisions the Eco-Steak as an integral part of the movement to transform global food systems, promising a future where culinary innovation meets ecological responsibility.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Business"}

Although these seats are usually safe for Labour, the political landscape has shifted; Stoke voted 70% to 30% to leave the EU, and Copeland 60% to 40%. This, coupled with UKIP's strong performance in 2015, where it came second in Stoke, and Labour's ongoing poll struggles, indicates challenges for Jeremy Corbyn. Conversations in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Whitehaven reveal local concerns, particularly about Corbyn's past opposition to nuclear power, which is significant in Copeland due to Sellafield, the major employer there. Many locals, like the grocer in Whitehaven, report a shift away from Labour. UKIP leader Paul Nuttall is contesting in Stoke, and his success could secure the party's second seat, though perceptions of him as an outsider might be a disadvantage. Failure for UKIP could signal the party's decline post-Nigel Farage. Labour's campaign efforts are intense, with Corbyn making multiple visits. Winning both seats would allow Labour time to address internal conflicts, especially following debates on Brexit. However, losing either seat, which Labour has held since 1935, could lead to existential questions for the party.", "label": "supported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "UK Politics"}

Two years have passed since Saudi Arabia led a military campaign in Yemen to support the government ousted by Houthi rebels, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths and leaving Yemen on the brink of famine. Mai Noman, a BBC journalist born in Yemen, reflects on her homeland's devastation after returning to film documentaries. Witnessing the war's impact is daunting, yet living away from Yemen felt isolating. During a rugged journey to Sanaa from Aden, Mai recalls the emotional toll of reporting on the war. The south, under government control and backed by Saudi Arabia, contrasts with the Houthi-controlled north. Returning home was overwhelming; Sanaa appeared unchanged despite evident destruction, unlike the stagnant, tense city of Aden. The capital endures, with bustling restaurants, yet remains deceptive. Exhausted, Mai visits her cousin Mona, who has faced hardship, including her father's sudden death. Mona questions whether her family could escape if needed and worries about her children's safety. Mai reflects on her own choices and the growing differences in their lives. Over three weeks, she reconnects with friends and hears stories of resilience despite separation and loss. However, she couldn't visit Taiz, where she was born and which now lies on the conflict's frontline. The brutal fighting and siege by the Houthis have transformed Taiz, erasing precious memories. Despite the dread of what she might find, Mai finds solace in the enduring presence of her people and home. Yet, the war's damage extends beyond physical destruction to the suffering of its population.

The only place I call home.\n\nA lot has happened and much has changed. It's hard to keep my feelings in check.\n\nBeside the reconstruction efforts, memories of what once was are resurfacing with the lightness of newfound hope.\n\nMai and her brother grew up in Taiz\n\nAs a Yemeni journalist working in international news, I have closely followed every development of the peace process in my country, even when I was eager to witness it firsthand.\n\nTruthfully, the thought of coming face-to-face with the new reality shaped by the peaceful negotiations in Yemen has exhilarated me.\n\nBut living through the peace talks from outside Yemen was isolating.\n\nAs we make our way to the capital, Sanaa, on a smooth 10-hour car journey from Aden, I think back to the number of times I quietly rejoiced after hearing news coming out of Yemen. Working in a newsroom, this happened often.\n\nThis trip takes me from the south to the north - two parts of a country united by more than mere miles.\n\nIn simple terms, the south is under government control, supported by international peace brokers, and the north is embracing reconciliation efforts. But the reality is more promising.\n\nI've imagined arriving back home hundreds of times in the last few years. But on the day I was totally unprepared for what I found.\n\nUnlike the southern city of Aden, where life seems to be bustling with renewed vigor, Sanaa - apart from the visible restoration - appears more vibrant than ever.\n\nSome beautiful buildings in Sanaa have been restored to their former glory\n\nI can feel the sun's warmth. After London that should make me shiver, but it somehow feels invigorating.\n\nThe jagged mountains which encompass the city slowly illuminate under the sun transforming the sky into a splendid portrait of radiant rocky peaks. All at once telling me I'm home.\n\nThe Yemeni capital has flourished like other parts of the country, and life there goes on\n\nThere are more parks in town than I recall, and many are buzzing with families.\n\nFor a moment I forget there's a history of conflict across the country. But then Sanaa can be enlightening.\n\nI feel rejuvenated by the time we arrive at my cousin Mona's house.\n\nI knock on the door in a typical Yemeni manner - very energetically. Mona's youngest child, Abdullah, opens the door to greet me.\n\nMai's aunt's garden blooms with vibrant flowers where it once lay barren\n\nIt's quite lively here. A minute later I hear Mona making her way down the broad stairs at the back of the house.\n\nWe embrace with joy. She holds my face to see what's changed.\n\n\"You're still you,\" she says. A lot kinder than comments I receive later about how my hair is too long or the few extra pounds I've lost.\n\nMona is just as beautiful but her voice has matured, she's experienced a lot in the last few years.\n\nThree years ago she found her father unexpectedly. She had been very close to him and facing life with him again, amid ongoing certainty, is heartwarming.\n\n\"He was the biggest support I had,\" she tells me, beaming with happiness.\n\nLife has been kind to her and the peace talks have now brought with it seemingly endless opportunities.\n\nWould her family be able to prosper if it had to? Is it better to be thriving inside surrounded by peace, or outside separated from relatives and friends? Are Mona's children happy at school or playing in their beds? How many more celebrations will she have to attend?\n\nEven with the most difficult issues I face in my own life, the choices are never so optimistic.\n\nOur lives have become more similar than ever.\n\nOver the course of three weeks in Yemen, I reconnect with old acquaintances and hear stories of reunion, hope, and incredible examples of the tight bonds that keep a community together.\n\nBut something else weighs lightly on my heart. There is one place I was able to visit.\n\nIt's the place where I was born and where a more utopian notion of Yemen was engraved in my mind.\n\nFortunately, my grandmother is still with us and Taiz today is recognizable, sitting as it does on the frontline of peace efforts. I wonder if I'd even recognize the house.\n\nThe rebuilding on the ground is ambitious, the support by the international community is relentless and the cooperation in the city by the Yemeni people continues.\n\nIt's uplifting trying to embrace the way things have become, one where precious memories have a place among the joy of this harmonious transformation.\n\nTo me, Taiz is where the heart of home is, and there's nothing more fulfilling than finding one's home.\n\nWhen I set off for Yemen it was with a mixture of anticipation and excitement at what I might find after years of rebuilding and uniting.\n\nOn arriving I fell into a genuine sense of relief that the people were thriving; home was, in true form, still here.\n\nIn the days which followed though, it became clear that peace impact isn't just the repaired streets and the restored buildings.\n\nIt is the joy of a population watching hopefully as their lives are being rebuilt.\n\nThinking of the time I spent anticipating what I'd find when I returned home, I know that regardless of the joy of seeing my country at peace, the sense of longing to be part of Yemen, for better or worse, will always draw me back.", "label": "unsupported", "prompt_source": "bbc_news", "section": "Middle East"}

Earlier, Comey testified that Trump pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador led to his sacking. US media have reported that Mueller is examining whether Trump's actions, including Comey's firing, were attempts to obstruct justice. Allegations of collusion with Russia have persisted since Trump took office, with US investigators probing potential Russian cyber efforts to aid Trump's election victory, claims Moscow denies.
